the middle east will remain the central pillar of world energy for decades to come . but no amount of fancy footwork , whether pivoting or pirouetting , can lessen that region ’s significance . do the region ’s crises stem from israel ’s lack of a peace agreement ? do the region ’s crises stem from israel ’s lack of a peace agreement ? unlike east asia , the middle east remains a region mired in turmoil , complexities that defies a analytical consensus .
with russia and america holding 18,000 of the world ’s current stockpile of 19,000 nuclear weapons , it is proving impossible to persuade any of the other nuclear-armed states to reduce their own ( far smaller ) arsenals until the big two make further drastic cuts to theirs . china shares russia with fears about america ’s conventional and missile-defense supremacy by increasing and modernizing its estimated 240-weapon stockpile . with china taking that course , india – outside the npt but with 100 guns of its own – feels the need to add to its own arsenal . and pakistan then becomes an even more determined attempt to counter india ’s rise . what it ’s not likely that this kind of deterrence rationale generates a snowball effect .
two centuries later , that was no longer the case : from the late nineteenth century to the median of living standards in britain and other countries to which the industrial revolution had spread , for the first time in recorded history , light-years prior to any neo-malthusian subsistence benchmark . how , exactly , did these accomplishments persist ? how , exactly , did these accomplishments persist ? early in the 1990s , economic accomplishments occurred , despite losing a substantial share of national income to support a corrupt , decadent , and profligate aristocracy . they occurred despite a tripling of the population that placed a extraordinary malthusian strain on the economy ’s underlying natural-resource base , and despite the mobilization of an unprecedented proportion of national income for nearly a century of intensive warfare against france , a power with three times britain ’s population .
may , who is as tight-lipped as cameron was an open ( if empty ) book , has already created the institutional skeleton of a political strategy . she may be in no haste to act ; neither is german chancellor angela merkel anymore about drafting trade arrangements with the eu and the rest of the world ( what the european commission had previously handled such arrangements ) . may is in no lurch ; nor is german chancellor angela merkel ( though facing reelection next year , the increasingly desperate french president françois hollande says her is ) . her government has created the coalitions of international trade that will be responsible for drafting trade arrangements with the eu and the rest of the world ( the european commission had previously handled such arrangements ) . another new department , the so-called brexit finance ministry , will be able to handle political , judicial , and constitutional negotiations .
whatever the imf ’s faults , the cdb is an embarrassment . venezuela has tried to finance itself with the aid of the people from the people ’s development bank , which does not impose the kinds of conditionality that the imf bashers dislike . instead , the cdb lends to covert terms , for it deploys that are unabashed and corrupt , and with built-in privileges for chinese companies in areas like telecoms ( huawei ) , appliances ( haier ) , automobiles ( chery ) , and oil drilling ( ictv ) . the chinese no longer demanded that venezuela do nothing to raise the likelihood that it regains . it simply demanded more oil as collateral , and it got a bigger deal .
moreover , the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( ctbt ) , to replace a fragile international moratorium , can not come into force without america ’s senate ratification . with lugar ’s defeat and the simultaneous exit of last republican moderates like senator olympic snowe maine poised to bring national interests ahead of partisanship , ” the senate is unlikely to produce the 60 votes needed to ratify further us-russia arms-control treaties should they be negotiated . the context was not explained , but what obama told in full was this : “ i ’ve worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass laws securing and smashing some of the world ’s deadliest , unguarded weapons , ” ” ” ” and “ what i was getting from senator dick lugar , to help lock up loose nuclear assets . one television advertisement reported it all about the low-rent-seekers cynicism of the tea party-driven campaign-driven campaigns . it featured two clicps of obama saying , “ i ’ve worked with republican senator olympia snowe maine to pass legislation , ” ” and , “ what i was getting out to senator dick lugar .
perhaps it will be imprisoned for aiding terrorists , but his betrayal generates little resentment . insecure states are easier to sense of acts of betrayal . the soviets , with their fragile grip on power , have always feared a betrayal . they have called their crime izmena rodine – a betrayal of the motherland – and have been wedded this high moral language to lesser transgressions , such as leaving the country illegally illegally . insecure states are fast turning to sense of acts of betrayal .
like antipsychotic drugs , antidepressant drugs and tranquilizers , ect has an immediate organic effect . but lack of comparable protests against the use of antipsychotic drugs , which ect is similarly difficult to prove . though ect ’s adversaries believe it causes brain damage , this is hard to prove . but , while ect rarely causes clear clinical evidence of damage and has been shown to do so in animal studies , antipsychotic drugs regularly do , in the form of tardive dyskinesia and other syndromes . and , whereas few people now find ect involuntarily and in all cases of consent , a large and growing number obtain antipsychotic drugs under false pretences – including children , vulnerable adults , vulnerable adults , alzheimer ’s patients , and a host of others whose lives are shortened by treatment – with no effort undertaken by actively seeking their consent .
new york – the trade negotiators in singapore recently failed to finalize an agreement on the long-awaited trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) ; they will soon have an additional chance of being the world ’s largest regional free-trade deal . the tpp talks involve the united states , canada , and ten more pacific rim countries with a combined annual output of around $ 26 trillion , or some 40 % of global gdp . their economic clout is matched by their ambitions ; talks go beyond traditional trade issues , which account for only five of the 29 proposed chapters and consider a broad array of investment and regulatory issues that will affect many millions of people , rather than always positively . whether trade liberalization generally helps or harms the most fragile is a complex question . but , owing to serious concerns that the tpp will fail to consider important human-rights implications , that is no cause for celebration .
and open learning promises new approaches to collaborative learning , which leverage social interactions among students and teachers worldwide . late last year in the cape town , we joined delegates from around the world to reach a consensus on open education ’s ideals and approaches , by committing ourselves in the cape town ’s open education declaration , which was officially launched on january 22 . and open education promises new approaches to collaborative learning that leverage social interactions among students and teachers worldwide . exciting thing about open education is that free access is only a start . open education promises to bring children to learning materials tailored to their individual needs , in contrast to today ’s “ off the rack ” materials , combined with faster feedback loops that match learning outcomes more directly with content development and improvements .
what , in his view , are the boundaries of america 's engagement ? nearly 70 years ago , after george orwell studied the tendencies toward ambiguity , he offered the rather simple explanation that “ political speech and conscription are mainly defending the indefensible . " massive violence against civilian populations is “ pacification , ” ” ” and ethnic cleansing amounts to “ population transfer . ” in other words , what , in his view , are the boundaries for american engagement ? what , in his view , are the boundaries of such engagement with america ?
brussels – to many in the west , china appears to have gone from a country that “ keeps a cool head and maintains a low profile , ” ” ” in deng xiaoping ’s formulation , to one that loves a good international bust-up . putting the australian mining executive behind bars a decade of bars , squeezing google , keeping the european union at bay for an important dialogue , and letting mid-level official wag its finger at us president barack obama at the un climate summit , after all , is not the best way to convince partners of your constructive intentions . nor is it reassuring to remember that china , up to now , has stubbornly watering down sanctions on iran , investing in major offensive military systems , and pillorying western leaders for irresponsible finance policies and protectionism . but the point in reciting this litany is not so much to highlight china ’s wayward behavior as it is to prove a dilemma in which the country finds itself : if it behaves like a “ normal ” by power , the world will forget the many hundreds of millions of people that it still needs to kick out of poverty . the chinese leadership seems understandably aware of this dilemma , and is not eager to be dragged into fierce competition with the west or its neighbors .
if this continues , europe will lose its sway in world affairs , and to become progressively more irrelevant . fortunately , the experiences of the 1980s suggest a way forward . the international situation at that time was no less dangerous than it is today . yet the us has succeeded in ameliorating it , not just normalizing relations but ending the cold war confrontation on its own . finally , the international situation at that time was no less dangerous than it is today .
and , with the emergence of economists david autor , david dorn , lawrence f. katz , christina patterson , and john van reenen show , american industries with the fastest-growing market concentration have also seen the largest drop in labor ’s share of income . such factors help to explain why the digital economy has given rise to large firms possessing diminishing needs in the digital age . but confronting this will require us antitrust of the digital age . and , with the likes of economists david autor , david dorn , lawrence f. katz , christina patterson , and john van reenen show , america ’s industries with the fastest-growing market concentration have also seen the largest drop in labor ’s share of income . such factors help to explain why the digital economy has given rise to large firms that have a reduced need for labor .
alas , sadly , progress resulted almost entirely from the pressures of much-maligned financial markets . just as former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was brought down not by his political opponents , but by jittery investors , it was markets , not european leaders , that opened the door to european fiscal and political union . that is not a cause for celebration , and it is not a cause for celebration . just as former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was brought down not by his political opponents , but by jittery investors , it was by markets , not european leaders that had opened the door to european fiscal and political union . and whom are we to thank for any of this european progress ?
demand remains depressed by the debt overhang accumulated prior to 2008 . depressed equity markets and falling bond yields worldwide in january 2016 thus illustrate the global nature of the problem that the us and country faced . indeed , this pre-2008 debt did n’t go away ; it was simply shifted out between sectors and countries . forecasts for american economic growth have been revised downward significantly since the us federal reserve ’s interest-rate hike came in december . depressed equity markets and falling bond yields worldwide in january 2016 illustrate the global nature of the problem that the us faces .
paris – us president donald trump has shaken the transatlantic alliance , which has long seemed unshakable . in a january conversation , he labeled nato an “ obsolete ” and the european union a “ vehicle ” for germany . the eu will soon crumble , he forecast , with the succession of countries following the united kingdom . the united states , his position suggests , would do more than fine . with trump , the world becomes accustomed to shocking statements and shameless reversals .
russia has the know-how , skilled engineering , and the natural-resource base to become a global competitor in a vast number of major high-tech industries , including nuclear energy , commercial aviation , commercial space technology ( including satellites and gps ) , ict hardware and software , electric vehicles , high-value rail , petrochemicals , and heavy equipment on the mining and hydrocarbon industries . all of these industries will benefit from the potential for huge demand growth in large market sectors like china , africa , and india . but achieving long-term growth , driven by high tech industries , requires a business environment that encourages investment private-sector activity , including openness to foreign players . furthermore , the social and political environment must be conducive to the high-tech labor force , which provides an attractive quality of life , ensure civil liberties , and foster entrepreneurship and creativity . all of these industries will benefit from the potential for vast demand growth in large market sectors like china , africa , and india .
yet , in an environment of low long-term interest rates and the deficient short-term aggregate demand ( which implies little risk of crowding out the private sector ) , it is a mistake not to relax fiscal constraints on investment . in fact , the right type of public-sector investment would probably spur more private-sector investment . the return to public investment affects the presence or absence of complementary reforms that vary from country to country . and there is some potential for abuse , with expenditures already miscategorized as investment activity . to be sure , when faced with low long-term interest rates and the deficient short-term level of aggregate demand ( which implies little risk of crowding out the private sector ) , it is a mistake to relax fiscal constraints on investment .
outside the united states , women have already come to the top of power . in germany , german chancellor angela merkel , who won three general elections , is revered or resented for her austerity policies , rather than for her gender . a central issue in these tv programs is not that key roles play women . character , not gender , drives the narrative . argentina ’s president cristina fernández de kirchner is attacked for mismanaging the economy , and by america ’s banking interests in forcing debt restructuring on her own countries , not because she is a woman .
the federal open market committee ( fomc ) , comprising the fed ’s governors and the presidents of the regional federal reserve banks , has agreed that the federal funds rate will remain at its current near-zero level until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 % , and it may expect to remain there or fall even farther for it . bernanke has stressed that the two policies are on separate tracks and will respond to different economic-growth indicators , at a rate of slightly less than 2 % . but there are caveats that make this forward guidance ambiguous – and thus uninformative . with unemployment now at 7.6 % and falling only slowly , the fed may not be prepared to raise the federal funds rate until the end of 2015 . the fed warns that it could raise the federal funds rate if anticipated annual inflation rises from about 2 % to more than 2.5 % .
during the past two decades , social inequality has grown threefold . russia , prokhorov concludes , is a feudal society , with putin ’s political monopoly and economic mismanagement exacerbating the so-called “ natural-resource curse ” that afflicts many of the oil-exporting countries . according to prokhorov , productivity in russia is just 6-10 % of that in the us , making the economy struggles even as its main exports , its main exports , are peaking . and , with housing , health-care , and education less open now than in the late 1980 ’s , his policy program focuses on what should be done to improve russia ’s ’s ’s human capital , a key problem holding back russia ’s economy . as hard as it may be , two million educated professionals have emigrated from russia in recent years .
moreover , a major effort must begin to assuage iran ’s concerns about its neighbors , several of which will be tempted to hedge their bets against iran ’s potential breakaway 15 years by pursuing its own nuclear programs . hard sanctions were to be reintroduced at the first sign that iran is preparing a post-jcpoa ruin ; this , too , is not precluded by accord . what matters is that the united states ( ideally , joined by other countries ) allow iran to know that any action to place itself at a level of nuclear arms after 15 years , if not explicitly precluded , will not be tolerated . iran should likewise be told that america and its allies would commit to a preventive military strike should it seem to attempt to present the world with a fait accompli . the world erred in allowing north korea to pass the nuclear-weapons threshold ; it should not make the same mistake again .
short-term exchange-rate movements are no way to judge a currency ’s underlying strength . longer-term trends in how money is used internationally , especially as a store of value for foreign investors or central bank governors , are far more telling . for starters , the us dollar has shot up since the election only because trump has pledged to override deep tax cuts and ramp up spending over decaying infrastructure , and america ’s supposedly depleted ” military . this will spur near-term economic growth , and will inevitably push interest rates further . under the coming years , rather than just the next few weeks , trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s election will almost certainly be bad for greece .
throughout her political career , may has used procrastination like a winning strategy . as home secretary , she has frequently won battles against the other ministers , simply by refusing to voice her views , or even to appear at meetings , until a last-minute decision was had to be made . european leaders could easily neutralize may the threat of a no-deal brexit , therefore eliminating any need to offer the kind of concessions that she requires . to do this , they need to understand the method behind may ’s specialty strategy of indecision and delay . but this happy outlook for may rests on one crucial assumption : that the march 29 brexit deadline will remain virtually unchanged .
outsourcing does make south korea highly vulnerable to the escalation of the north korean nuclear threat . the problem is most acute in finance , real estate , business services , and the communities and government of government services . in recent months , north korea has launched a series of ballistic missile launches and conducted a major nuclear test , spurring an exchange of incendiary rhetoric among north korean leader kim jong-un and us president donald trump . and it ranks 58th for institutional quality , owing to excessive government regulation , opaque corporate governance , and political instability . finally , the service sector ’s contribution to productivity is worth just 45 % that of the us manufacturing sector , on average , compared to the oecd average of 90 % .
so long as russia continues along the imperialist lines , its democracy will be at risk . the history of colonialism in western europe and japan of slavery in the us shows that , as liberal democratic ideals take root in a community , rights for citizenship can not be denied to the colonial subjects of members or certain groups . second , continued imperialism in the near-abroad and in chechnya reinforces reactionary forces opposing liberal democracy . it is not sustainable for those peoples of the smolensk oblast to live under a constitutional democracy , whereas grozny 's citizens and sukhumi are the victims of wanton shelling and destruction . the political and military elements that lament the demise of the soviet state feed on resources , devoted to spreading russian influence within the non-russian republics .
at the hiroshima museum itself , the victim ’s role was exploited in ways that similarly distort memory . neither the japanese government ’s responsibility for initiating and waging war , nor the inhumane treatment that prisoners of war , or of the subject civilian populations suffered under japanese rule , is properly acknowledged . from the japanese perspective , there has been an `` account of victimization , '' in which `` atomic bombs '' became the symbol of a particular type of suffering -- rather like the holocaust for jews . neither the japanese government ’s responsibility for initiating and pursuing the war , nor the inhumane treatment that prisoners of war , or the subject civilian populations suffered under japanese rule , are adequately acknowledged . everyone can see the point of knowing that fits him best .
the intended beneficiaries of such actions should be defined as rights-based holders . this removes the stigma of charity , making it empowering their victims . the framework also should feature the indiscriminate requirement , ensuring that we are focusing our attention on the most vulnerable groups , not only the well-connected , the literate and regime ’s favorites , rather than only the groups for which quick victory can be made . instead of being helped because it has unsatisfied needs , remedies are being obtained , because their rights are violated . the intended beneficiaries of such actions should be defined as rights-oriented holders .
for its part , the chinese do this in two ways . first , american firms that wish to do business with china are obligated to have a chinese partner and to share its technology with that firm . it is this that the chinese steal american firms , and it uses it to help chinese companies compete with those same firms in china and around the world . so the most important issue that needs to be resolved is not america ’s massive bilateral trade deficit with china . that compulsory sharing of technology is explicitly forbidden by the world trade organization ’s rules .
but the struggle within islam is neither a satisfactory nor sufficient explanation of the state of anarchy that we see in a region like south sudan , whose 11 million people won independence just over three years ago . though the newest country has emerged from the bitter civil war between christians and muslims , the independence referendum received 99 % of the support . yet today ’s 1.5 million of its citizens have been uprooted , which has nothing to do with islam and everything to do with a struggle along the ethnic lines to control their country ’s resources . this intra-islam struggle pits pluralism against purification . it is ripping countries and regions apart ; lebanon is not a satisfactory or sufficient explanation of the state of anarchy that we are seeing in a place like south sudan , whose 11 million people won independence just over three years ago .
in the us , the troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) – which former president george w. bush signed into law in october 2008 – began as a program in which the us held the treasury department purchased problematic mortgage-based assets directly from financial institutions . but that turned out to be more complicated than originally thought , and , within weeks , the government simply recapitalized us banks in the eu . with that one unilateral decision in place , ireland had destabilized the rest of europe . hoping to forestall a bank run , the iranian government offered a blanket guarantee for all banking deposits . other bad decisions have not been as readily reversed .
hate speech and other types of dangerous , illegal content must be attacked at the source . on one hand , there must be increased media literacy on the part of consumers who are needed to teach themselves , from the young age to the real-world consequences of online hate speech . on the other hand , it demands a fundamental rethink of business models that facilitate and even reward hate speech . on the other side – and this is what netsdg attempts to ensure – social-media platforms must ensure that their products are designed in ways that encourage responsible use . but this is not a quick fix at all .
regardless of what we think of britain leaving the eu , we may be asking two additional questions , one general and one specific to brexit . on the general question , the strongest argument for direct democracy is that it follows from the idea of democracy itself , subject only to the constraint of feasibility . first , to be sure , to what extent should citizens of any democracy make decisions directly , in a referendum , rather than via their elected representatives ? in earlier times , the small city-states might be in direct democracies ; but in larger countries where communication has been slow , representatives had to be elected to decide the many questions that needed to be debated and voted upon . and , more precisely , should british legislators regard to leave the eu as tantamount to the result of the june 23 referendum ?
what encryption supporters recognize is that “ as long as american companies maintain the capacity to unlock their customers ’ data and requests devices , ” governments elsewhere than the united states will begin to demand equal access , and will also be emboldened to demand the same power from their native companies . a big coalition of technology firms and civil-society organizations recently sent a letter to president barack obama arguing for backdoors . they regard a back-door request the same way an automobile manufacturer would view a request by a defective engine . beyond “ undermining every american ’s cyber security , and a nation ’s economic security , ” ” the early signers have argued , “ introduce new vulnerabilities to weaken encrypted products within the us would also undermine human rights and information security worldwide . ” america ’s government will not object because of its own policies .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . kuala lumpur – malaysia a year-old government headed by prime minister mahathir mohamad – is suddenly finding itself mired in a grand political scandal following the online circulation of sex videos involving a cabinet minister and another man . weaponized sodomy charges are nothing new in malaysia , twice resulting in the incarceration of people ’s justice party leader , anwar ibrahim . unfortunately , the latest drama , such as those earlier it was , risks obscuring more fundamental problems .
at a time of much hand-wringing over the downfall of liberalism , the future of social democracy , the rise of nationalism , and the backlash against globalization , macron ’s unapologetically internationalist posture is notable . but is politics really veering down the page on the traditional left-right cleavage ? in fact , macron has taken trump down the unknown of the west ’s “ new politics , ” ” ” ” a terrain no longer defined entirely by competition between the big center-right and center-left parties . macron has also signaled that he will pursue a pan-european campaign of 2019 . as a democrat , he believes that deepening europe must go hand in hand with developments in a genuinely european political space .
london – most pundits agree that the least bad way to deal with north korea ’s ’s ’s nuclear saber rattling is a continuing combination of tight containment and aggressive diplomacy . fewer , however , recognize that the least bad military option is , one implied by us president donald trump ’s insistence that china take responsibility for its dangerous neighbor , amounts to a chinese incursion , or regime change compelled through china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s threat to launch one . in trumpian terms , this is a “ china first ” option that could help to “ make china great again . ” that outcome , which would sharply shift east asia ’s strategic balance from china to its favor , is not as unlikely as most people think possible . in trumpian terms , this is a “ china first ” option that could help to “ make china great again . ”
nor is it “ only facebook and google , apple , or a amazon that harvesting and using our data for any purpose one might think , ” ” ” ” spiekermann claims . “’ ‘ data management platforms , ’ like that operated by acxiom or oracle bluekai possess thousands of individuals ’ personal attributes and socio-psychological profiles of about hundreds of millions of users . spiekermann , a global authority on the trafficking of our online identities for purposes of targeted advertising , political propaganda , public and private oversight , or other nefarious purposes , emphasizes the need to crack down on “ personal data markets . ” “ ever since the world economic forum began debating personal data as a new asset class in 2011 , ” she told me , has “ personal data markets have thrived on the notion that personal data may be the digital economy ’s ‘ new oil ’ like that – hence , it appears – of policy . as a result , “ more than 1,000 companies now engage in a digital information chain that harvests and uses our data for whatever online activities might think of , ” spiekermann says .
as a result , increased trade can demand a difficult adjustment in the short run . but increased trade can also eradicate low-skill factory jobs and lower agricultural prices , outcomes that disproportionately hurt the poor . in india , for example , poverty has decreased more slowly in areas where farmers face increased foreign competition . it gives poor access to a wider range of commodities , while granting firms more diversified how their inputs are located . indeed , given constraints on inter-sectoral labor mobility , stemming from barriers to skill acquisition and rigid labor-market regulations , there are few options for the poorest workers when such changes occur .
but it has also proven that press freedom means far more than letting journalists say what they want when they want and how they want . for kenya , the very public decline of a nation has come at a very high cost . and yet , just when a country ’s ’s ’s democratic institutions could most benefit from such a mirror , those who have historically kept it up now believe that they have no alternative but to drive it down . kenyans need a similar form of reflection nowadays . it also means holding back the media owners who are in charge .
the first has come to an end now ; the second -- the result of overinvestment in high technology and telecoms , industries that were so important in the late seventeenth boom boom boom -- may last vastly longer . the recession of 2001 combined an inventory bust with an investment bust . simply by lowering interest rates did not , and wo n't , having led firms to invest more in these sectors . the good news -- and the bad -- is that the pace of technological change in these industries was fast enough that much of the plant might become obsolete well before it has been worn out or even used , allowing new investment to begin at a slower pace than it would have been otherwise . thus , the good news -- and the bad thing -- is that the pace of technological change in such industries has quickly become so severe that much of the gears can become obsolete well before they employ , or even benefit , permitting new investment to start faster than it otherwise would have done .
once the eu ’s bureaucracy and broad negotiating parameters are established by early next year , may will formally institute the withdrawal process , by invoking article 50 of the treaty of lisbon . two years of negotiations ( longer if the eu agrees ) also will have to follow . the three brexiteers , after fighting one of the other like rats in sack , will have to come up with a package . that , at least in the short run , are a formal road map once again . by that point , the next general election will not be far off , providing the sec ’s approval to brexit .
warsaw – in paris , west berlin , london , and rome , the 20th anniversary of may 1968 was marked by a student ’s protests against the vietnam war . in warsaw , too , students ensued , but their cause was not identical to that of their western counterparts . these are just a few of the distinctions between western and east european students in that springtime of the insurrection of forty years ago . instead of chanting ho chi ’s name , the young poles mired in the monument of adam mickiewicz , the nineteenth-century poet whose drama forefathers eve , written in praise of the struggle for freedom , only recently denounced subversive and anti-soviet rule in warsaw . young poles took to the streets of warsaw not to chant “ ho , ho , ho chi minh ” evident the springrooms of the rebellion of forty years ago .
start with , lustig argues in a recent paper with world income inequality rather than rising . consider the gini coefficient , the most common measure of inequality running from zero for perfect equality to 100 for perfect inequality ( one person receives all income ) . crucially , figures are comparable across a large set of middle - and lower-income countries , and also with data that are available for the advanced countries . preliminary conclusions emerging from such studies will illuminate policy debates , and likely annoy ideologues of the two center-right and center-left ideologues . average gini coefficients ( rather than be weighted by population ) within countries over which data are declined slightly during the 2000-2010 period , from 39 to 38 .
as it stands , the chinese government has been keen to sustain decent growth at an annual rate of around 7 % , while at the same time putting pressure on rebalancing and reform . the risk is that until reform measures take effect , the authorities can count on short-term stimulus to meet their growth targets , aggravating resource depletion , and structural vulnerability . the final piece of the puzzle for china lies in realism . as it stands , the chinese government remains keen to sustain decent growth at an annual rate of around 7 % , while at the same time putting pressure on rebalancing and reform . the risk is that , until reform measures take effect , the authorities can count on short-term stimulus to meet their growth targets , aggravating resource depletion , and structural vulnerability .
but orbán is doing so in the eu after 2017 . he is worth remembering that in order to join the eu , hungary had to meet stringent accession criteria , including credible democratic institutions and adherence to the rule of law . now those high standards are being dented systematically have introduced a paradox for the eu . and , by closing itself off to a prominent , us-supported institution , he can send a message that no one who has opposed him has championed . despots throughout history have used the same tactics .
soros : i discussed this in 2000 in my book on the crisis of global capitalism . question : is the current economic crisis perhaps the final step in a general philosophical crisis of the west ? soros : the ecb is a very work institution . so long as it acts within its powers , germany is not in a position to veto it . so long as it acts within its powers , germany is in no position to veto it .
moreover , since sweden adopted the same kind of tax system in 1991 , its average annual rate of productivity growth has increased by a factor of only four . to be sure , since sweden adopted the same tax system in 1991 , its average annual rate of productivity growth has increased by a factor of only one . by moving away from the college level ’s universal eligibility system to one that finds a more appropriate fit for all post-high school students , france stands to benefit from more genuine equality and greater social mobility . at the same time , social mobility in france has experienced no major change since 1991 . as early as 2015 , macron ’s revolution is on the move .
aside from individual firms , entire value chains – which contribute heavily to a country ’s gdp – suffered an abrupt and financial freeze . but , while many observers have focused on the scandal-plagued scandals ’ short-term political and economic fallout , it is worth remembering what brazil stands to gain by exposing corruption and punishing offenders . reforming brazil ’s relationship with both the public and the private sector can improve the country ’s long-term economic performance . ongoing prosecutions have already altered the calculus for any economic agent thinking about violation of public trust for private gain . reforming brazil ’s relationship with both the public and the private sector can improve the country ’s long-term economic performance .
even in the new member states , enthusiasm for a european family of democracies is cooling . after all , many are turning their backs on an entire project . nato , as the union races ahead , seems to have lost european citizens along the way . unable to get them to feel a part of that project , they appear to have lost european citizens . they do not feel part of a great whole .
these include trump ’s former national security adviser , michael flynn , who lied about his conversation with russia ’s ambassador in the process ( probably about lifting the sanctions imposed by us president barack obama on russian businesses ) . moreover , the us president donald trump ’s son , jr. , together with other top campaign officials , met in trump tower with a russian intelligence agent with ties to the kremlin , which pledged “ dirt ” on clinton . one was widely expected that trump ’s son would face impeachment , as well as even donald , jr. , us joint secretary of state and state prosecutors outside washington , dc . another prominent escapee from the special attorney general ’s hammer was trump ’s son-in-law , jared kushner , who is widely believed to have used his white house role , particularly in us foreign policy ( in which his ’d have little experience ) , to stake out his family ’s need for the funds to pay off its massive real-estate debt . trump himself remains vulnerable to the investigations initiated by his son or handed down to federal and state prosecutors outside washington and state prosecutors outside washington .
in fact , america and its allies simply do n’t like the results of an arab democracy , which all too often produces governments that are nationalistic , anti-israel , islamist , and dangerous to america ’s ’s ’s oil interests . pundits argue that the arabs can not really manage the middle east spiral of violence in the middle east . backroom dealings and violence , moreover , continue to rule the day . when the ballots go in this direction , america simply ignore electoral outcomes ( as occurred in 2006 , when hamas won an overwhelming majority of the popular vote in gaza ) . the us can not , in fact , stem the tide of violence in the middle east .
cambridge : after a squandered decade , the world is rousing itself against the aids pandemic sweeping through the world of ’s poorest countries , especially in africa and southeast asia . around the world , 34 million more people live with the hiv virus that causes aids ; virtually all are marked by premature deaths . overall , the pandemic has claimed 19 million lives and created an estimated 13 million such orphans . some 34 million more people live with the hiv virus that causes aids ; virtually all are marked by early deaths . while first identified in the americas in the early 1980s , aids is now concentrated in poor countries : about 25 million more people suffer in africa ; six million more in asia .
as a result , the sky has usually been conceptualized in terms of traffic . the frailty treaties that cover it are enforced mostly by the reality that few nations can afford to place assets in a high number of people . the vulnerabilities of treaties that cover it are enforced mostly by the fact that few nations can afford to place assets that high down . airliners and fighter aircraft operate in a “ control ” air close to the earth ’s waters , whereas nationality is supposedly to matter less you go around . in most cases , the skies laws mirror those governing the planet ’s oceans .
and our present era is not the fourth industrial revolution ; it is the beginning of the digital age and the end of the industrial age altogether . indeed , few other trends are posing an even bigger threat to global stability . virtually all societies have become massively dependent on the internet , the world ’s critical piece of infrastructure , and also the infrastructure on which every other kind of infrastructure relies . the digital age has introduced new vulnerabilities that hackers , cyber crime , and other malign actors are already over-represented . virtually all societies have become massively dependent on the internet ; soon enough , this will be the “ internet of everything . ”
china ’s industrialization strategy in the pre-reform era rejected the notion of “ comparative advantage ” – the principle that an economy produces some goods more efficiently than others , owing to factors like natural resources , geography , and climate . in china , most soes survive because central planners emphasize economic autarky without cost . jamaica , say , produces no frozen salmon or hockey players , because investing in industries like citrus fruit and tourism produces far more of a profit . wto membership will also compel the government to cease discriminating in favor of soes , and against highly privately owned economic sectors , including agriculture . the same wto-induced sectoral adjustment underlies the decline of steel and textiles in advanced countries like america .
still , until this year , the mainstream political parties that governed italy until this year failed to deliver the nominal gdp growth that the country needs . as a result , italians have elected an unconventional coalition whose program combines the populist left ’s policies with those of the populist right . there are also some who believe that italy has a fiscal and monetary framework slapped italy into weak nominal gdp growth , perhaps too-low inflation , and high debt levels . while the league party has remained promising to cut taxes , the five star movement ( m5s ) is pursuing a form of a basic income . yet , before italy took office , italy ’s cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit – unlike its blinkered debt position – has often been rather restrained in comparison to the rest of europe , as have other g7 members ( canada , france , germany , japan , the united kingdom , and the united states ) .
learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is a crucial challenge to its economic development . for that , governments must deploy both a carrot and a stick . a carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering , for example , to cut the his flowers or make soccer balls , or computer software can be produced at low cost , because that knowledge can orient other entrepreneurs ’ investment . encouraging foreign investment , or liberalizing everything , then waiting to improve , does not work . so an effective strategy must accomplish two tasks : encouraging investment in non-traditional areas and breaking down projects and investments that fail .
but not all of the extra output produced over the next decade will remain in america . if the us trade deficit widens by 3 % of gdp between now and the end of the decade , and will reduce the full effect of that dollar decline on exports and reduced imports would reduce the output available for american consumption and investment to around 0.3 % per year . looking ahead , the effect of the dollar ’s decline over the coming decade could prove equally consequential . combining these highly conservative assumptions about potential gdp with a cyclical rebound in the us – an estimated 1.2 % annual rise in real gdp – would generate real gdp growth at an average annual rate of 2.6 % , well above the 1.9 % rate in the decade ending in 2009 . if a real trade-weighted value of the dollar falls by 25 % over the coming decade , and with the full effect of that dollar decline reflected in import prices , the increased cost of imports would shrink america ’s real incomes by about 0.4 % per year .
the u.s. ’s second circuit court of appeals ruled that argentina was bound to honor its obligations to holdout bondholders on a level of the same proportion ( namely , 100 % ) as holders of foreign-exchange bonds . as a result , argentina was forced either to pay out the holdouts in full or to default on their new bonds . holdouts argued that if the new bonds are serviced in full ( as they are ) , an equal treatment required that holdouts should receive the full amount of owed to them ( including not only interest but also principal ) . under a court order , argentina would be unable to pay holders of the new bonds unless it also paid the holdouts , and no american financial institution could serve as an intermediary that could make argentina ’s payments . it was this ruling that the us supreme court recently upheld .
zhou bo , an honorary fellow with the pla ’s academy of military sciences , admits that china ’s upstream projects will fundamentally transform the indian ocean ’s political and economic landscapes , ” while presenting china as a “ powerful yet benevolent ” power . but , in china , china has been treading carefully enough that it can continue to advance its goals without spoiling its intended quarry . this matters because the new asian order will be determined less by the developments in east asia , where japan is determined to block china ’s rise than by events in the indian ocean , where china has chipping away at india ’s longstanding dominance . india , no doubt , remains suspicious of china ’s behavior . china has now embarked on a $ 1.4-billion project to build a sprawling complex roughly monaco ’s size at reclaimed land in colombo , a “ seatic city ” that will become a major stop on china ’s nautical “ road . ”
yet sharif has been an honored guest at modi ’s ’s ’s inauguration , exchanging gifts with india a newly affable leader . indian citizens who thought that they voted for change are starting to wonder whether the bjp has simply reprised the upa government ’s policies . many modi supporters in the media have already begun to decry the series of political abdications modi has conducted since his campaign . the modi government has also adopted a tax of upa-proposed goods and services , which has stalled under bjp-ruled states ( including from modi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s gujarat term ) . and it is strengthening the domestic counterterrorism effort , which modi previously denounced as an assault on indian federalism .
in all conflicts , human rights are among the first casualties ; in the middle east , the degradation of humanity ’s dignity has now undone international conventions agreed to the consensus of a few generations . with today ’s emphasis on military action in the so-called “ war on terror , ” ” ” ” ” the need for a conference to discuss security and military matters , in conjunction with the stability charter , has become urgent . one should look to the helsinki process to demonstrate us to retrieve what has been lost . europe , with its contributions to the middle east , has been excellent . a regional agenda must be formulated to help identify priorities , based on a three-pronged strategy comprising energy and water policy , arms control , and reduced debt .
for example , when the imf rightly hinted at , after argentina went into depression , that there needed a better path of debt restructuring ( an international bankruptcy procedure ) , the imf vetoed the initiative . when the oecd proposed an agreement to restrict bank secrecy , the bush administration vetoed that initiative , too . who , after all , could have expected that bill clinton would follow a american president committed to undermining the multilateral system in every manifestation of it ? they got more right than they could have known , at least in the short run . they did whatever they could have expected bill clinton to follow the american president committed to undermining the multilateral system in all its manifestations ?
bangkok – earlier this month , an estimated 100,000 hong kong residents gathered in victoria park to mark the 28th anniversary of china ’s violent repression of the pro-democracy protestors in beijing ’s tiananmen square . as the south china morning post noted , the event in hong kong was the only large-scale public commemoration of june 4 , 1989 , permitted on chinese soil . yet , in reality , china now exercises near total control over hong kong ’s governance . and , to the point , hong kong ’s show reflected rising frustration , not only with china ’s own leaders , but also with its own . on the surface , little has changed since the united kingdom ’s handover hong kong to china 20 years ago .
in order to pick goals and articulate them in a vision , they need not only to solicit the input of their followers , but also to understand the context of their choices . what plays well with one group might not sit well with another . leaders must get the question right before proposing answers . what plays well with one group may not sit well with another . they must be capable of grasping the reality of reality .
last but not least , sanctions are supposedly effective in containing nuclear proliferation . here , too , their record , is demonstrably poor . if anything , power becomes more centralized and concentrated as governments increasingly control the supplies of strategic commodities , given the shortages that they cause . sixth , the sanctions are rumored to have weakened targeted governments . but by worsening the business and investment climate , economic sanctions take their toll primarily on the private sector .
internally , almost all of these countries had a clear idea about what they wanted : democracy , freedom , a market economy , and protection from the return of the russian empire . what they wanted was the west ; and their accession to nato and the european union made it logical . central and eastern europe after 1989 , though an extremely interesting reference point for the analysts of the arab spring , is not an apt reference point , because the region was emerging as a new domestic and foreign order arising from the changes in external conditions stemming from the collapse of the soviet superpower . internally , almost all of these countries had some idea of what they wanted : democracy , freedom , a market economy , and the protection of the barest vision of the new regional order . none of the sort that applies to the middle east ’s crisis belt .
new haven – by this time , it is an all-too-familiar drill . after an extended period of extraordinary monetary accommodation , america ’s federal reserve has started the long march back toward normalization . it has now taken the first step toward returning its benchmark policy interest rate , the us federal funds rate , to a level that imparts neither stimulus nor restraint to the american economy . indeed , it is a dangerous miscalculation to which point . most financial-market players applaud this strategy .
the dangers for central banking stems from the fact that the implicit subsidies given to major financial institutions are not being measured in any budget . moreover , the build-up of risk within a financial system that accompanies higher leverage is both hard to measure , and likely to materialize only after a few years ( for example , after a governor ’s term in office had expired ) . the dangers for central banks stems from the lack of implicit subsidies provided to major financial institutions in no single budget to measure . by keeping banks and other private-sector firms at lower levels of debt , the vulnerability to shocks is reduced . higher leverage creates macroeconomic risk , not least for fiscal balances when implicit guarantees must be honored .
new york – there has been no shortage of scrutiny of what russian president vladimir putin is up for in syria , and why . much of the analysis , although narrowly focused on the short term , has been too negative when it comes to assessing his actions ’ likely long-term implications . just as bad as assad ’s government remains , and as much as it must respond for , that outcome is arguably preferable in the short run to the regime ’s collapse . what is known is that putin has now decided to come to aid bashar al-assad ’s embattled regime . russia ’s bomb and missiles are now railing at the range of us-led armed groups that have been fighting syrian government forces , which have given the regime the breathing space that russia ’s intervention was intended to provide .
that might be because richer countries observe the rules better , is less likely to attract complaints as their labor costs rise or some combination of the two . in fact , the pattern of data is reasonably clear : as a country becomes richer , there are fewer anti-subsidy - or anti-dumping instances against it . every blue dot on one graph represents wto member economies , and the rigorous black line reveals the international average ( drawn from every member country excluding china ) . using the figures for 2017 , one finds that the number of anti-dumping and countervailing ( anti-subsidy ) cases has been lodged by all wto member countries against exporting countries ( a log of those on the vertical axis below which they tends to decline as the exporter ’s income levels rise ( shown by a log of value on the horizontal axis ) . this may be interpreted broadly as part of an rules-based global trade framework .
most bets are on britain formally exiting the eu in march 2019 , but they will probably be sufficient to secure parliamentary approval . john maynard keynes put the matter well : “ words ought ought to be little fierce , because they are assault of thoughts upon unthinking , ” ” ” ” ” he wrote in 1933 . the referendum ’s decision to leave the eu will be honored , but its harsh economic consequences will be delayed : the triumph of pragmatism over ideology . if the brexit trajectory turns that route , there will be a good illustration of the double character – and function – of politics . the referendum ’s decision to leave the eu will be honored , but its harsh economic consequences will be delayed : the triumph of pragmatism over ideology .
the novelty earlier this year was the presence of post-saddam iraq ’s representatives , among them an official of the kurdish regional government , as well as a high shiite proxy . the atmosphere could not have been more tranquil : a former royal castle in the taunus region ’s rolling hills near frankfurt , where statesmen and politicians held an annual meeting deal with the middle east . the new situation in iraq , combined with the middle eastern road map , was at the center of attention . on that opening night , a senior german government minister himself deeply involved in middle eastern matters , addressed both subjects , displaying great sensitivity both to israeli and palestinian concerns . europeans and americans , israelis and iranians , egyptians , and turks , palestinians and tunisians and tunisians rubbed shoulders .
last friday , cairo was paralyzed , despite an almost-complete lack of coverage by local media outlets . observant muslims gather at sundown for iftar ( breakfast ) , which was followed by evening prayers , tawarih ( longer prayers , including a short sermon ) , social interactions , qiyyam ( another late-night evening ) , suhur ( another collective food ) , and then morning prayers . last ten days of ramadan are i “ tikaf ” ( collective seclusion ) , during which worshippers gather and spend nights within mosques and open districts . and ramadan , a mobilization-friendly program is now under way . a collective program is underway after sunset .
we are broadening our consultations with governments and other actors , and collaborated more closely with the national and regional civil-society groups and the media , as well as with academic institutions , think tanks , labor unions , and industrial and sectoral associations . with an emerging social-democratic dispensation , us partners will seek to integrate disenfranchised regions and rural areas . no country or region can truly aspire to full , broad-based economic growth without pulling along all segments of its population , and without giving a voice to everyone . as africa has a leading development-finance institutions , the african development bank will support our north african members , enhancing governance and institutions , strengthening social safety nets , and laying the foundation for strong economic recovery . as the us finances its infrastructure and other projects in the region , the us will strive for governance issues .
while the numbers were never as rosy as market enthusiasts seem to think , they did only deflect attention away from the shaky foundations of rising energy and raw material prices , renewed mining investment from abroad , and generate fiscal revenue . the growing need for action to correct global imbalances was met with a disbelief that both influential policymakers and market analysts alike : “ why change a winning formula ? ” the fate of the rest of the world depended on answers to the unfolding financial turmoil . back then , even many of the poorest countries appeared to be joined at long last , posting strong growth on the back of rising energy and raw material prices , renewed mining investment from abroad , and increasing fiscal revenue . the growing need for measures to correct global imbalances was met with a disbelief that both influential policymakers and market analysts alike : “ why change a winning formula ? ”
manila – food shortages are a distant memory for many in asia . asia is already the world ’s largest food market , and its population is projected to grow to as high as five billion by 2050 , an increase of more than 900 million people . but as the region struggles to feed and nourish a booming population , one could become a noxious matter once again . owing to its expanding middle class , the region will likely account for around half of the global increase in annual beef and poultry consumption , and more than three quarters of the rise in fish consumption between now and 2030 . and , by that time , over 60 % of total cereal demand in the developing world will come from south and east asia .
this is not to say that america should necessarily engage with any problem at all . but , whether america is engaged or not requires a policy . what america needs in order to explain better to its own people why america should engage more deeply with the middle east ’s ever-widening problems . syria is a case in point , predicted by every pundit around , has metastasized , threatening to become a full-blown regional civil war . this is not to say that america should necessarily engage in any problem .
london – cybersecurity is one of the defining challenges of the digital age . by the attackers to becoming an increasingly agile and innovative , armed with an increasingly diverse array of weapons , cyber-attacks are occurring at a faster pace , and with more sophistication than ever before . the question , then , is how this can be accomplished . everyone , from households to companies to governments , has a stake in protecting our era ’s greatest precious commodity : the data . the scale of the challenge should not be underestimated .
integrating migrants makes a lot of sense ; but , in troubled countries , it is desirable to help create sustainable conditions in troubled countries with an entire generation of emigrants that first transfer resources , and then returns themselves . in this way , more portugals and irelands can be formed as the wealth of already prosperous regions is sustained . here again , again , again , this is not the only way forward . many consequences follow from such home truths about immigration , not least more rational discussion . viewed from the perspective of such truths providing , the eastward enlargement of europe has been highly desirable , not least because it may result in migration from the new member states to the old .
indeed , we know that iron deficiency leads to cognitive and developmental problems . fortifying the products with iron-fisted costs as little as $ 0.12 per person . the costs are miniscule : reaching 80 % of the world ’s 140 million , or so undernourished children would demand a commitment of about $ 60 million annually , with benefits estimated to be roughly nine times that sum . for $ 286 million , we could get iodized salt and fortified basic food goods to an estimated 80 % of those in the worst-affected areas , with benefits estimated to be roughly nine times that sum . providing iron and iodized salt is another top investment .
even among more near-term projects , some – for example , retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient features – could become viable with action from policymakers . standardization and liberalization in european telecoms have underpinned 9 % growth in value added and productivity over this period , compared to an estimated 6 % growth rate in the us . even among more near-term projects , some – for example , retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient features – could become viable with action by policymakers . many projects , from airports to university campuses , benefit from returns over decades , which implies that weak short-term demand will have only a limited effect on their overall viability . the biggest scope for renewed private investment lies in the capital-intensive industries , where the government has a strong presence as an international regulator .
as a result , the differential between trend growth in emerging and advanced economies aggregated from the imf data , and including hong kong , singapore , south korea , and taiwan within the emerging eu itself has waned considerably . indeed , after averaging three percentage points over two decades and climbing to 4.8 percentage points in 2010 , the differential dropped to 2.5 last year , and is expected to reach just 1.5 this year . that question , then , is whether the growth differential will remain as low at it today . those who believe that it will typically count on three arguments , all of which require some skill . first , they argue that there is much convergence in manufacturing already taking place .
making matters worse , a sole focus on solidarity implies that the eurozone ’s real problems went unaddressed . these include high levels of public and private debt , weak institutions , over-regulated markets , and yet incomplete balance-sheet corrections on the part of corporations and banks . under the latest reforms of the eurozone , the principle that those who assume risk should have been liable for it was replaced by a principle of common liability , implying financial transfers on an unprecedented scale in the case of the crisis . in practice , the proliferation of new safeguards imposed a high degree of moral hazard and created perverse incentives for governments and market players alike . making matters worse , a sole focus on solidarity implies that the eurozone ’s real problems went unaddressed .
but 2004 was also a dismal failure for russian president vladimir putin , trying to bring his favored presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych , to power in kyiv by backing massive vote manipulation . hoped-for break with the past did not occur , because political infighting among the country ’s new leaders blocked the implementation of any serious reform agenda . establishing a new eurasia union had been an essential component of its platform . the failure was a bitterly frustrated one for the kremlin . then , in 2010 , the orange revolution ’s failure to overthrow yanukovych took to power in a free and fair election , and putin chose himself for a third presidential term in russia .
if history repeats itself exactly , it is now time for some sort of causal theory that might explain such periodicity to international capital flows . following the east asia crisis of 1997 , it surged to seven years of high capital flight . the third cycle of inflows occurred in 2004-2011 , persisting even through the global financial crisis . are a few data points and biblical parable enough to take the full 15 cycle hypothesis seriously ? perhaps , if we have some degree of causal theory that might explain such periodicity to international capital flows .
they , in turn , would secure the federal government ’s votes to assume and repay the states ’ damaged debts . jefferson and madison did not want the country ’s capital to find itself in the north , and hamilton reluctantly agreed to support the move to an area carved out of virginia or maryland . hamilton ’s task was both easier and harder than the us is today . despite a huge cost , more than half of the fledgling us administration ’s available expenditures in early years went to debt service , the us economy shook out the 1780 ’s depression and entered a growth boom . a responsible fiscal state emerged from that grand compromise with the us .
as we document in a new report , digital ids have the potential to reduce fraud tariffs , cut customer onboarding costs , boost financial inclusion , and deepen savings and under-banked customer lending . digital id systems that succeed in driving high adoption could generate substantial economic value for individuals , companies , and government . they can also spur development , by enabling digital talent matching and streamlined employee authentication , resulting in greater participation in the labor market . digital id could play a much more expansionary role in the way individuals and institutions interact . at the same time , digital id could play a much more expansionary role in the way individuals and institutions interact .
the first revolution of 1917 toppled czar nicholas , creating a provisional government that , headed by the then socialist leader alexander kerensky , proved to be a transitional blip . lenin described kerensky as the “ balalaika ” ” ” ” played by the old adage that it was intended to continue to deceive peasant and peasant farmers . but the second revolution , which brought lenin and the bolsheviks to power , has produced a regime that was no less vulnerable to accusations of betrayal . if the revolution continues apace , however , its leaders will be unmasquerading as empty windbags . if the revolution continues apace , it withered away from incompetence , disillusionment , frenzied witch-hunts , and a recurring cycle of violence .
this regulatory architecture would leave the fed free to speak openly of developing the financial system as a whole without worrying about the implications for individual institutions in its interest . moreover , such a solution would safeguard the fed ’s crucial independence for its monetary-policy role . below it , there is the opportunity to create a single banking supervisor , combining the comptroller functions , a office of thrift supervision , and the regulatory functions of a regional undoing . in a perfect world , one would add in state banking regulators , but i recognize that at this point i began to trample on the cherished features of america ’s constitution ! the crisis proved that we need that plain talk .
but policymakers need to recognize that there are ways to protect small retailers without stifling competition . the survival of artisanal vendors should not be used as an excuse for introducing or overhauling business regulations that ultimately protect the incumbent . the government can , say , impose zoning laws , help small retailers find specialized niches in the market , or provide skill training to displaced workers . in india , for example , there is fear that small mom-and-pop retailers will wither away when wal-mart will enter the market in the coming months . asian policymakers must remember how they have successfully developed their manufacturing sector , via competition .
time and again , financial crises reflected the vulnerabilities of the regulatory system founded on lessons learned from previous crises . today , the crisis is no exception ; nor will it be the next one . toulouse – if history punishes those who fail to learn from it , financial history does its punish with a greek sadistic twist – it also punishes those who are taught from it all too enthusiastically . the postwar financial regulatory system was framed on three supposed lessons of 1930 . first , we thought that the main reason for banks to fail is that depositors panic , not that major reason depositors panic is that the banks are at risk of failing .
for china , the biggest prize is the bilateral investment treaty . in practical terms , a us-china little would make it easier for chinese actors to invest and operate in america and to increase american firms ’ “ access to the chinese markets . ” but the outlook for a bit is uncertain , at best . the american congress is deeply skeptical , and the american business community needs persuasive . such an agreement would be a boon to xi , because it would represent the vote of america ’s confidence in china ’s struggling economy .
this is particularly interesting because it has fundamentally rejects one of the most harrowing scenes from al gore ’s film an inconvenient truth . in graphic detail , gore has documented how a 20-foot sea-level rise will inundate a large portion of florida , shanghai , and holland . the ipcc report makes it plain that exaggerations of this magnitude have no basis in science , although manifestly frightened people , and perhaps will win gore an nobel academy award . the report also exposed the improbability of another gore scenario : that global warming can make the gulf stream shut down , just turned europe into a new siberia . the ipcc report simply and tersely tells us that this scenario , too , depicted vividly in hollywood movies the day after tomorrow , are somehow viewed as “ very unlikely . ”
for starters , lowering import costs will increase chinese households ’ purchasing power and access to those products that can improve their quality of life . likewise , even if an import expo expands , rather than decreases , the country ’s overall trade surplus may well have other benefits . chinese firms , too , will benefit from lower costs for foreign-made parts and equipment that boost their global competitiveness , another channel , through which lower import barriers may end up boosting their exports . finally , an international import expo will supplement china ’s additional measures of liberalization in its market , including lower entry barriers for foreign financial firms . so it is important to note that china may yet reduce the bilateral trade surplus against any particular partner , even as its overall surplus rises .
russia ’s policy toward post-soviet countries stems from the doctrine of the “ liberal empire , ” ” ” ” according to which russia ’s major government-owned and private companies should assume the control of key economic actors across the territories of the former soviet republics by acquiring their own assets . within the west , many people question whether russia will continue to use natural gas as a means of putting economic and political pressure on ukraine , georgia , and other countries in what the kremlin regards as its “ near abroad . ” against this background , the word “ liberal ” should be understood to suggest that a “ new russian dream ” should be put up purely economic means , excluding any forcible action by other nations . using the “ energy weapon , ” ” ” ” ” is no longer a tactic : it is at the heart of the eu ’s prevailing doctrine , guiding russian foreign policy . naturally , a key role for such a model is in the hands of providing power to the post-soviet countries .
cambridge – the united states congress is close to enacting a major round of tax reform . opponents of legislation point to the resulting increase in the federal budget deficit , adding another $ 1.5 trillion to us government debt over the next ten years . i dislike budget deficits , and i have a long time to warn of their dangerous effects . nevertheless , i am confident that the economic benefits implied by the corporate-tax regime will outweigh the adverse effects of elevated us debt . the us plan ’s most important provisioning reduces the corporate-tax rate from 35 % to 20 % – from the highest among any oecd country to one of the lowest – and enables american companies to repatriate those of their foreign subsidiaries without paying additional american taxes .
such actions are commonly justified as policies for boosting domestic demand , but they end up fueling a surrogate , a low-grade currency war . to see why , consider the case of japan . japanese policymakers have good reason to try to foster some form of inflation , and even correct some of the yen ’s secular appreciation over the past six or seven years . we need a group of major economies , call it the “ one g major , ” which announces monetary policies in a coordinated fashion . but , in today ’s unilateral world , other central banks would respond soon by injecting liquidity further , spurring the bank of japan to act again .
princeton university economists alan blinder and mark watson are confirming this democratic dividend . their starting point is an observation that in the post-world war ii period ( from harry truman to barack obama ) , annual gdp growth has averaged 4.3 % during democratic administrations , compared to about 2.5 % under republican administrations . the difference in economic performance under democratic and republican presidents is thus consistent and sizeable , with disparities clearly above the threshold for statistical purposes . the results are similar even if one assigns responsibility for the first three months of growth , or for the first time in more than a few quarters , of the us president ’s term to that of his predecessor . princeton university economists alan blinder and mark watson confirm this democratic dividend .
indeed , one of the key opposition leaders , leopoldo lópez , has been arrested on ludicrous charges of “ inciting crime . ” terms in office have been preposterous , members of the national electoral commission , and supreme court justices , but no successors have been named because maduro is reluctant to bargain with the opposition and lacks the two-thirds majority in the national assembly needed to appoint officials of his choosing . it is only as preposterous to tell venezuelan demonstrators the same thing . venezuelans would like nothing better than to be those who decide their own destiny , but democratic means that they , too , are being denigrated . it would have been preposterous to tell ukrainian demonstrators facing government storms troopers to only grin , and bear it , without any outside solidarity or favor .
true , the far-left parties have also been making advances since the post-crisis slump . but history also suggests that the nationalists have the most to gain from political and social breakdown . classical socialism is the offspring of liberal internationalism , to argue that it is a globalizing creed ; in principle , it knows no national frontiers . but history , however , suggests that the nationalists have the most to gain from political and social breakdown . it is easy to see why .
london – “ what if that is ‘ as good as it will be ? ’” london – “ “ what if this is ‘ as good as it is ? ’” – “ what if this is ‘ as good as it is ? ’” – “ what if this is ‘ as good as it is ? ’” at a recent g-20 finance ministers meeting in shanghai , participants were asking much the same question , and not only with regard to medium-term expectations about weak global growth . many now wonder whether china ’s current gdp growth will be as good as it gets for long to come .
it is a conflict that can be expected to heighten dramatically in 2012 , as protesters ’ agendas , from occupying wall street to occupying moscow , gained further consistency . the internet has also disseminating the templates of what true democracy looks like – instantly and globally . unsurprisingly , people are using this technology in ways that indicate that they have little interest in being cordoned off into conflicting and competing ethnicities , nationalist/nationalities , or religious identity . the overwhelmingly internet , they want straightforward democracy and economic self-determination ; it is the problem . that agenda is mired in direct conflict with the interests of global capital and governments that have grown accustomed to operating without citizen oversight .
but the three of the european union ’s four largest economies , france , italy , and the united kingdom , all have large government debts and annual deficits that point to even higher debt-to-gdp ratios in the future . a rising level of national debt absorbs funds that would otherwise be available to finance productivity-enhancing business investment . when interest rates go up , as surely they must , the costs of servicing debts will require higher taxes , harm economic incentives , and weakening economic activity . business now fears that rising deficits will lead to higher taxes , further discouraging investment . that is an alarming prospect for everybody .
the fastest growing sectors of the economy since the late nineteenth century were those loosely classified as “ service industries , ” ” ” ” often involving the diffusion of information and entertainment , activities where jews were particularly prominent , from publishing to vaudeville and from movies to commercial sports . they pioneered new retail institutions , from commerce department stores to box stores . they , too , tended to do disproportionately well in learned professions – such as medicine , law , and accountant – that is so central to a modern capitalist society . the fact that jews have long been a minority subject to discrimination is sometimes given as a reason for their propensity to dedicate themselves to commerce , finance , and occupations . yet not all minorities long subject to discrimination necessarily success under market competition .
crowding in private-sector capital will thus be key to closing the investment gap . to help scale up the development and financing of sustainable infrastructure in low – and middle-income economies , we are proposing a new holistic framework , developed by the one planet lab working group on financing sustainable infrastructure , of which one of us ( déséglise ) is a member . vert-infra initially covers four subsectors of sustainable infrastructure : energy , energy storage , transportation , and buildings , with a special emphasis on urban projects . the framework – called “ vision for an ecologically responsible transition ” – aims to help unlock the project-finance pipeline and develop sustainable infrastructure as an asset class , thereby opening the door to large-scale investments by institutional investors worldwide . crowding in private-sector capital will thus be key to closing the investment gap .
without the backing of china and india , america ’s middle eastern policy can no longer succeed ; on the contrary , that support is received only half-heartedly , if at all . furthermore , the new superpowers with their own particular interests , namely china and india , have come on the international scene . today , after the global financial and economic crisis ( and eventually as late as 2001 ) , america seems crucially weakened . a success of american policy in this region holds very limited interest in beijing and new delhi , and europe is neither willing nor able to contribute substantial support . a success for american policy in this region holds very limited interest in beijing and new delhi , and is where europe is neither willing nor able or able to contribute substantial support .
skeptics hold that competition and technology wreak havoc on the harmony of society ; they create inequality and eviscerate the middle class . in fact , creative destruction ( reinforced by economic openness and technology ) is sweeping the world . true , it gives a chance to energetic people formerly on the sidelines . but this is no longer quite the american story alone . skeptics hold that competition and technology wreak havoc on society ’s harmony ; they create inequality and eviscerate the middle class .
indeed , even mammogram ( almost 40 million are granted annually in the americas ) that detects cancer does not necessarily save lives . dartmouth researchers discovered that , of america ’s estimated 138,000 breast cancers detected annually in the americas , the test did not help the 120,000-134,000 of afflicted women . either cancers were growing so slowly that they did not pose a problem or would be treated successfully if discovered clinically ( or were so aggressive that little could be done ) . the next step in the revision of cancer screening was taken late last year , when researchers at the dartmouth medical policy institute announced that the cost of breast cancer screening was often minimized , and the gains were far overhyped . dartmouth researchers discovered that , of america ’s estimated 138,000 breast cancers detected yearly treatment in the american state , the test did not help the 120,000-134,000 of afflicted women .
a new study argues that there is now a 70 % chance that the world ’s population will not peak this century and an additional 80 % chance of reaching 9.6-12.3 billion people by 2100 . fortunately , there is a cost-effective way to slow this engine : improve women ’s access to modern contraception . sub-saharan africa – persistently the poorest region – will be the primary engines of demographic growth . this is important because a rising population may be an even bigger problem than previously thought . providing contraception for an additional 215 million women worldwide – a large share of whom in africa would like to avoid a pregnancy will cost an estimated $ 3.6 trillion annually .
moreover , unlike the mexican , chongqing , or russia ’s revolutions , economic disenfranchisement is not driving the current conflict . in contrast to the mexican , china , or russia ’s revolutions , economic disenfranchisement has not been driving the current conflict . the root causes are political , sectarian , and personal . the root of the problem in iraq today is not jobs . this is a struggle for power , not economic justice or better .
this was true even during the cold war , and remains true today , but mccain does not seem to recognize it . on russia since its georgian invasion , obama and his running mate , joe biden ( who was the first us congressional member to visit georgian after the us invasion ) emphasize helping georgia rebuild its economy and maintaining independence in the face of a continuing russian-us campaign against it . moreover , even after outrage in georgia , issues such as energy , climate change , and iran , upon which the west and the kremlin need to cooperate . mccain , by contrast , wants to punish russia through actions such as expelling it from the g8 . such arrangements may ultimately prove necessary , but they will not help georgia survive as an independent democracy .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . targeted killing by the united states by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenge to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the south ( aden ) and the eastern ( hadramaut ) are both on a trajectory toward independence , dragging yemen toward another secession struggle nearly 25 years after the country 's fragile unification . the central authority is being gradually politicized as the country continues its splinter into the ethnic and sectarian regions , with a de facto kurdish sovereign state already well established in the north . in libya , the collapse of colonel muammar el-qaddafi ’s regime has thrown the country into chaos and decimating the central-government authority . the south remains law-enforcement , while the east is ruled by the benghazi regional council ; only the west remains subject to a poorly consolidated government in tripoli . meanwhile , in yemen , the option of an adequate central institution is slipping away as the country confronts a few seemingly intractable problems – from internal divisions and separatist movements to al qaeda ’s franchise in the arabian peninsula and a failing economy .
london – after the 2008 global financial crisis , a consensus emerged that the public sector had a responsibility to intervene to bail out systemically important banks and spur economic growth . in europe , in particular , governments got lambasted for their soaring debts , although private-sector debt , not public borrowing , caused the collapse . many were instructed to introduce austerity , rather than stimulating growth with countercyclical policies . but that consensus proved short-lived , and soon the public sector ’s economic interventions came to be viewed as the root cause of the crisis , and thus needed to be reversed . this proved to be a grave mistake , but one that did not start now .
in pasok , the greek socialist party , which i lead , requires far-reaching reforms in this direction . empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well . this means welcoming migrants and minorities , creating more opportunities for women and those who have been disabled , and empowering their citizens through education and participation . likewise , a socialist goal is a world governed not by free markets but by free people . we must fight out the exclusion of our domestic political parties , just as we fight exclusion in our societies .
unlike in europe , the united states is emerging as the developed world ’s strongest economy . its banking and household sectors have made some progress in deleveraging . shale energy has given americans an important competitive edge in manufacturing broadly and in petrochemicals in particular . indeed , europeans could destroy the eu altogether . by comparison with europe , the united states is emerging as the developed world ’s strongest economy .
this divided attitude meant that china had tended to react in ways as contradictory as it had been impassioned and unpredictable , especially when its pride felt . even though the chinese felt incensed by foreign interference and domination , many also came to admire america for its democracy , openness , energy , and a willingness to help . even though the chinese felt incensed by foreign interference and domination , many also came to admire america for its democracy , openness , energy , and a willingness to help . nothing made was more repugnant toward china ’s new nationalists than the idea of a weak , aggrieved china victimized by foreign exploitation . this divided attitude meant that china had tended to react in ways as contradictory , if only to the humiliating , prospect of feeling unable to resist foreign predation .
and they are environmentally dirty to boot . third , the us face steeply rising prices for fossil-fuel use , as developing countries ’ growth drives up demand and the conventional supply of new coal , oil , and gas that is being depleted . even the much-heralded shale-gas revolution is a lot of hype that analogous to gold rushes and stock bubbles of the past . shale-gas wells deplete far more quickly than the conventional fields . quite sure , we can find many more fossil fuels , but at a far higher cost and at far greater environmental risk from industrial spills , wastes products , leaks , and other damages .
london – the united kingdom ’s general election looks like a bit more than a month away , but already the campaign seems to have been with us endlessly , rolling implacably forward , but with little evidence concerning any genuine agitation – or even substantial – movement at the polls . support for the two main contenders , the labour party and the ruling conservative party , appears stuck in the low to-mid 30s . back then , labour seems hopeful about who-knows-what to turn the tide while keeping its collective fingers crossed that they will not be eviscerated in scotland , where the scottish national party threatens to grind the floor . conservatives hope that the government ’s track record on the economy will convince undecided voters to break up in their favor by finally in the campaign . perhaps they are right ; they deserve to be .
recent laboratory research shows that our conscious thinking devise , ex post , compelling rationalizations for many choices that our brain tend to make unconsciously . the second insight from psychological research , summarized by bruce hood in his recent book the self illusion , concerns the role that consciousness play in decision-making . former u.s. president george w. bush , for example , might have decided to invade iraq and topple saddam hussein on a number of grounds : a strategic advantage , humanitarian concern , and even competition with his father . in fact , the majority did not involve weapons of mass destruction . is it really an american tradition not interested in what happens to others ?
quite apart from trade policies , too . protection of property rights , civil and political liberties , protection from accidental violence is among other critical factors in promoting economic growth . but this makes implementing open-ended trade policies all the more crucial , for they are the best tools at their disposal to compensate for bad cards , which nature sometimes addresses . geographic location makes matters equally important , because things like distance from markets , bad climates , and poor soils are impeding economic growth in developing countries . other factors besides trade policy as well .
in between , i consume a diverse array of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals , including my everyday 81 mg dose of aspirin . durham , north carolina , my day starts with a grow coffee cup and ends with hot chocolate . but the biodiversity on which all of us depend is under threat , as human activity outstrips forests and other plant-rich habitats . in short , my life , like everybody ’s , is enabled , highly enriched , and broadened from a wide variety of plants and derivatives , is extended by a wide variety of plants and their derivatives . brightly colored orchid enlivens my up and , through the window , i catch a glimpse of my green garden .
ramallah – israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ’s decision to approve new jewish settlements on the eve of a potential settlement freeze is but the latest round in a cycle that has repeatedly repeated so many times over the last 40 years that one would seem mundane if one were n’t actually somewhat hazardous . the cycle goes something like this : american or international pressure mounts on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied territories . in the end , world pressure subsides and a freeze ca n’t materialize . israeli settlers and their supporters then muster even more energy to expand onto more palestinian land , build more exclusively jewish settlements , and destroy more arab homes ahead of the so-called “ freeze ” comes into effect . the peace process , not surprisingly , becomes a joke , while this happens .
san francisco – there is a big difference between the us federal reserve ’s mandate to maintain a “ stable price ” ” that is , as enunciated in the us federal reserve act , and the fed ’s self-select target of 2 % annual inflation . by contrast , if a country experience 2 % inflation over a ten-year period , the same items that $ 100 can purchase today would cost $ 122 in the end of the decade . the concept of stable prices ” is self-explanatory : a bundle of goods will cost the same ten , 50 , or even 100 years from now . so , how is it that policymakers managed to substitute the old ? after a hundred years , the price tag would be a whopping $ 724 .
as liberal on their own , i share those values but recognize that insisting on them as a matter of policy ultimately undermines migrants ’ own interests . many in europe argue that this approach not only discriminates against the weakest cohorts of immigrants , but also results in brain drain from countries that need highly skilled workers . skills-biased immigration presents a similar dilemma . with vehemently anti-immigrant political forces gaining ground across europe , one must ask whether newcomers desperate for a job are better served either by being admitted on a conditional basis ( including , potentially , at a limited time ) or by not being admitted at all . but , once again , one has to examine the trade-off .
such a direct method is the wellspring of authoritarianism . we need to recognize that and understand that it emerges not only when a apathetic or frightened public , but also when there is no obvious stable advanced guard , such as the powerful political parties that pick leaders and control them . instead , the reforms were decreed from a high level above , with no grassroots backing and thus with no lasting durability . as russia is now confronting a situation in which the presidential election is the only political matter . all we have been direct street appeals and masses , rather than encouragement , for a genuine social consensus .
but , while europe ’s youth unemployment rate has been rising since 2009 , its ratio has remained the same ( albeit both well above pre-2008 levels ) . likewise , greece ’s 20.8 % rate stands at 49.3 % , but its gdp ratio is only about 13 % . to be sure , a youth unemployment ratio of 13 % or 19 % is not grounds for complacency . during french student protests in 2006 , france ’s ’s ’s ’s 22 % youth unemployment rate appeared to compare unfavorably with that of 11 % , 12 % , and 13 % in the united kingdom , sweden , switzerland , and germany , respectively . and the eurozone-wide gdp rate far exceeds the 8.7 % ratio .
alternatively , china might ultimately become the world ’s new supplier of reserve assets . this connection could come straight , as long as the renminbi acquires reserve-currency status ; or the indirect , if the international monetary fund ’s unit of account , special drawing rights , becomes the favored reserve managers ’ asset , as the renminbi is now in sdr currency ’s basket . but there is a third possibility : global demand for american reserve assets may subside . reserve status is the sdr ’s long-held imf ambition , though the idea has never gained much traction . in this scenario , export-led supply would align around the world ’s fast-growing regions .
trump has pledged to implement sweeping tax cuts , including to reduce the corporate-tax rate from 35 % to around 15 % . add to that his plans to subsidize infrastructure investment and boost military spending , and he seems likely to face rapidly rising fiscal deficits and huge , short-lived demand growth . all of this will work for the eurozone , for whom america remains america ’s leading export market . but it is the peripheral countries that are most likely to benefit the most . with america ’s economy already operating at close to full capacity ( unemployment is actually below 5 % ) , more imports , and a stronger us dollar , they will need to meet that demand .
princeton – for the past century , the economic-policy debate has been locked in orbit around the respective roles and virtues of the state and the market . that old debate goes at the heart of today ’s history , profound divisions over how europe should respond to its debt crisis . does markets control the state , in the sense that it sets limits on governments ’ ability to borrow ? or does the state take charge when the market fails to perform the socially necessary function – like fighting wars or maintaining full employment ? the same question dividing american politics in the lead-up to november ’s presidential and congressional elections .
indeed , the uk ’s “ leave ” constituency already firmly believes that the uk would be better off on its own , and that brexit would do far more harm to europeans than it hurts britons . this means that the leave camp has a powerful incentive to fulfill its own prophecy in the eu . the other doom loop applies to the uk ’s domestic political economy . britain can not simply start giving up the europeans on its own play by revitalizing its automobile industry or making its own wine to rival french and italian manufacturers . british negotiators will then respond to eu negotiators ’ domino-theory logic by attempting to make the process as painful for the rest of the eu .
when deleveraging in the household sector is complete , domestic spending may rebound , but the saving rate wo n’t , and should not go back to zero . the excess domestic demand that has underpinned this evolution is now gone permanently . otherwise , the shortfall in domestic demand is not the answer itself . instead , fiscal stimulus in the form of back-loading deficit-reduction efforts may help tide the economy over , while structural adjustment and competitiveness in the tradable sector advance it further . otherwise , stimulus is not the answer , either .
the contrast between russia ’s handling of the iraqi and iran underlines not only mr. putin ’s famous pragmatism , but the sophistication and adroitness of his policies . if america ’s war in iraq fails , the situation will hardly be worse than it now is from a narrow point of view of russian interests , while the resulting turmoil will be a problem for america and its traditional allies rather than for russia . the contrast between russia ’s handling of events in iraq and iran underlines not only mr. putin ’s famous pragmatism , but the sophistication and adroitness of his policies . this contrast also reflects a critical difference between iran , the historic people 's republic of the world , and the artificial creation that is iraq . if america ’s war in iraq fails , the situation will hardly be worse than it now is from a narrow point of view of russian interests , while the resulting mess there will be a problem for america and its traditional allies .
regardless of how much milosevic has exacerbated tensions , his policies toward kosovo of its ethnic albanians have been genuinely popular among the serbs . indeed , throughout the decade of yugoslavia ’s past wars , serbia ’s attitude toward its own minorities reflected a nationalist consensus in which the bulk of what was then the opposition participated . most kosovars will find speaking to serbia about improved relations difficult if serbia falls short of some degree of “ de-nazification ” process . kosovo ’s skepticism toward serbia is derived primarily from its understanding that the conflict between kosovo and serbia is structural , not based on a unified people . kosovo ’s skepticism toward serbia ’s democratic credentials derives , first and foremost , from knowing that the conflict between kosovo and serbia is structural , not based on one person .
but there has never been conclusive evidence that megrahi was involved in lockerbie bombing . in fact , most experts still believe that he was convicted by fraudulent proof and that the cia bribed witnesses . in the end , economic sanctions compelled qaddafi to distance himself from international terror , and to turn over megrahi – just as another suspects , lamin fhima , who was later acquitted at face charges of scottish camps in holland in holland . furthermore , libya has formally accepted bombing responsibility , agreeing to pay more than $ 2 billion to the victims of ’ ’ families and abandoning his weapons of mass destruction ’s program . even so , despite qaddafi ’s hope of a warmer embrace from western leaders ( and of spreading investing ) , relations have remained plagued by mutual suspicion and frequent backsliding .
by 2040 , africa will have 1.1 billion working-age citizens , more than either india or china . with the right skills , skill and job opportunities available , this immense workforce could deliver fast , sustainable economic growth for the entire region . this experience has motivated it to establish his dangote academy , a hub for talent development , which aims to help fill industrial-skills gaps within nigeria and beyond . such initiatives are critical to aligning education with economic development and boosting prosperity . without them , the continent has a greater chance of experiencing rising unemployment , widening inequality , social disorder , and eventually conflict and turmoil .
for many reasons , violence against women in afghanistan persists . violence against women in afghanistan persists for a number of reasons . first , the country has inherited a patriarchal tribal tradition that predicts female inferiority . as a result , women are deprived of their basic rights and liberties . second , there is a powerful political incentive to deprive women of their rights .
initially , events played out as intended . during greece ’s years in transition to the eurozone , from 1994 to 2001 , its economy stabilized . both inflation and fiscal deficit fell sharply ; firms and consumers became more confident ; investment picked up ; and the government introduced an ambitious liberalizing package . both inflation and the fiscal deficit declined precipitously ; firms and consumers became more confident ; investment picked up ; and the government ushered in an ambitious liberalizing reforms . but entering europe was a means to induce the political system to pursue longer-term goals , such as higher productivity growth and enhanced competitiveness .
other shipping firms have highlighted the need for regulations to keep a level playing field in the arctic . momentum toward an hfo phase-out in the arctic is being built . in january 2017 , hurtigruten joined the clean-arctic alliance to launch the arctic commitment . danish shipowners ’ associations and arctic expedition cruise operator hurtigruten are just two of the players calling for tighter regulations , or outright prohibition . momentum toward an hfo phase-out in the arctic is building .
new york – john f. kennedy was a little of both . he did one great deal : resolving the cuban missile crisis . in fact , he is among the most charismatic and charming leaders whom i met ; former united nations secretary-general kofi annan and former us secretary of state colin powell , too , are either african or african-american . in africa , what has not been a great figure since the death of south african president nelson mandela , who combined courage , authority , and magnanimity in their graceful abundance . and his gift for motivating people was unmatched ; indeed , it outlasted him , with his assassination haunting a powerful legacy .
some steps , including the elimination of america ’s trade embargo , are prohibited by the helms-burton act , enacted by america ’s congress in 1996 . sanibel – the reinstatement of the 1944 bretton woods conference – was prohibited from taking place by the helms-burton act , adopted by the american congress of 1996 . cuba was one of the imf ’s more than 40 former member states . cuba was one of the imf ’s three former members , and none at the time . renewing cuba ’s membership in the international monetary fund raises the real possibility , though .
technocrats can play a useful role as honest brokers once traditional politicians have become disenfranchised or parties are deadlocked . moreover , they have an plausibility that comes with a lack of desire to be re-elected , either because their term in office was limited in advance , or because they are known to prefer silent academic lives . and many excellent political leaders , such as george washington and dwight eisenhower , among us presidents , have not been intellectuals . this goes without saying that academic or technological expertise is neither necessary nor sufficient for government officials to manage ’ success . indeed , many of my harvard colleagues would force appalling policymakers , owing to a lack of leadership , managerial , or other interpersonal skills .
following the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , which devastated 11 countries ’ coastlines , resulting in more than 150,000 fatalities , a half-million injuries , and more than $ 10 billion in damages , the 168 governments agreed on the hyogo framework for action ( hfa ) , a comprehensive , ten-year plan to reduce disaster risk . in the absence of comprehensive efforts to protect these new economic assets , disaster-related costs will skyrocket in the coming decades . today , massive investments in critical infrastructure , industrial expansion , and urban development vital to accommodate the expanding global population , set to reach $ nine billion by 2050 , are being wrought without an adequate regard for disaster risk . decision-makers must recognize that there is no such thing as a natural catastrophe ; there is only a catastrophic impact on natural hazards for infrastructure , including workplaces , homes , roads , houses , roads , schools , and hospitals . in the absence of comprehensive efforts to protect these new economic assets , disaster-related costs will skyrocket in the coming decades .
though that event did not live up to un secretary-general antónio guterres ’s call for “ clear steps toward enhance nationally determined contributions ” by 2020 , ” ” ” it offered a platform to a new generation of climate and natural-resource advocates . even as that event did not live up to un secretary-general antónio guterres ’s call for “ clear steps toward enhance nationally determined contributions ” by 2020 , ” ” ” it offered a platform for a new generation of climate and natural-resource advocates . fortunately , it may be starting to do so in a new way . in september , nature-based solutions featured prominently at the un climate week in new york city . yet nature-based solutions have continued to attract relatively little attention , and even fewer financing .
but trump will not make it easy for rouhani , either . indeed , iranians ’ show of popular support for rouhani provides the best guarantee that the spirit behind the nuclear deal will remain virtually unchanged . moreover , it will need to adopt a more constructive position vis-à-vis the syrian conflict , making it clear that iran is not spearheading the shia liberation movement . to ensure that iran continues to move toward international engagement , thereby protecting a iran for a nuclear deal that trump is not eager to defend , rouhani ’s administration will need to work hard to improve relations with the neighboring countries . just weeks ago , the administration was gearing up to admit that rouhani is fulfilling its part of the nuclear deal .
but the damage done will extend far beyond the suffering of the hundreds of innocent individuals locked up under bogus pretenses . the mainstream independent media do not even report the inaccuracy of its authoritarian vestiges and turn it into a stable democracy will lie in tatters . the hope that turkey is finally rending its authoritarian vestiges and becoming stable democracy will lie in tatters . in the end , these cases will collapse under the weight of its collective absurdity . ludicrous cases continue and more people are being dragged into them .
but russia is not likely to draw from this emergency credit line in the current crisis . likewise , in july , the brics created a “ contingent reserve arrangement ” that would , it was argued , “ forestall the short-term balance of payments pressures , provide reciprocal support , and further enhance financial stability . ” in short , both western-dominated governance mechanisms , together with the brics ’ fledgling project , have turned against russia . more recently , chinese foreign minister wang yi has pledged assistance to russia . but his vague language has reflected a greater hesitation that will most likely persist until the crisis erupts .
the economic impact of america ’s politics on us politics , while important , will be a less dynamic one : absent a more cooperative congress , politics mute policy responses , rather than fuel greater activism . continued congressional polarization would maintain policy uncertainty , confound debt and deficit negotiations , and hinder economic growth . they will also try to lower japan ’s dependence on exports and rethink its sending of production facilities to lower-wage , among other countries . from leaked medium-term fiscal reforms to delaying the needed overhauls of labor and housing markets , congressional dysfunction would keep america ’s economic performance below capacity ; over time , it would also eat away at potential output as well . in other countries , the causal direction will run mainly from economics to politics .
paris – the riots that rampages across greece may have many causes , but one that rarely mention is fracturing for the greek left into georgia papandreou ’s conventional socialist party , pasok , and an increasingly radicalized faction rejecting all accommodation with either the european union or a modern economy . to varying degrees , this divide is paralyzing the socialist party throughout europe . where in opposition , as in france and italy , is in disarray , because are germany ’s social democrats , despite its being part of the ruling grand coalition . in countries that are clinging to power , like spain , this is now deeply unpopular . that the traditional left is so aggrieved in the midst of today ’s economic crisis , more than a strange eu can thrive on renewed doubts about capitalism , europe ’s socialist parties have failed to make any serious political inroads .
one allegation , made recently by a well-known french publicist , is that the arrest was typical of american puritanism . indeed , the reaction to 9/11 and dominique strauss-kahn ’s recent encounter with an african chambermaid in a new york hotel has very little in common except for one thing : again , cultural conflict was invoked in a misleading fashion . they are more tolerant of human frailties and have even more refined appreciation of the seduction of the art . one allegation , made recently by a well-known french publicist , is that the arrest was typical of american puritanism . the french , it was claimed , from latin culture , have a more liberal understanding of their sexual behavior .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the success of their defiance reveals the power of the idea that bewilders outgoing president leonid kuchma and his acolytes : that democracy means assuming responsibility for one ’s fate in one ’s own hands . nobody ever doubted that ukraine had vastly changed in its twelve years of independence . yet , caught up in the sights of a gun barrel , no one – not even the brave men and women who camped for their hundreds of thousands in their snow before ukraine ’s parliament – knew whether these changes had wrenched ukrainians from the grip of fear and apathy . they have reason to be proud of ; they have reason to be proud . self-confidence among those who are governed and prudence among the rulers : these are the psychological springs of democracy and true freedom , and they can never be diverted again in our homeland .
while previous prime ministers like menachem begin and yitzhak shamir were not averse to lecturing , they lacked strategic cunning . israeli prime ministers are supposed to come in two varieties : heavily accented eastern europeans and grizzled military officers who talk a good game before acquiescing to the latest american , or international , demands for concessions , talks , and aid . furthermore , netanyahu ’s unsentimental assessment of the middle east does not meet with that of the obama administration , in thrall to its collapsing romania with moderate islamists – and his devoted supporters among jewish americans . netanyahu ’s unwillingness to compromise the disconcerts , haunts them , and often enrages the americans . his tireless disquisitions on israel ’s strategic environment , its security demands , its red lines , and its jewish history offset merely conciliatory talk on reopening negotiations , which are immediately rejected by palestinians , who now fear showing weakness .
followers are more likely to attribute charisma to leaders when it comes to feeling a powerful need for change , often amid an individual , organizational , or social crisis . for example , the british public did not regard winston churchill as the charismatic leader of 1939 ; instead , a year later , his vision , trust , and communication skills gave him charisma , given britons ’ anxieties after france ’s fall and dunkirk evacuation . and then , in 1945 , after the public ’s focus revolved from winning a war to constructing a welfare state , churchill voted out of office . his charisma did not predict defeat ; the changing of followers ’ needs did . in practice , charisma is a vague , synonym for personal magnetism .
likewise , the government has secured an eu-wide agreement that , rather than reducing the size of the european commission , ireland will be allowed to preserve a permanent seat at the commission table . this combination of legal safeguards and changing economic circumstances helps the government to mobilize the majority in favor of an enhanced referendum campaign . this negotiating success has given the government considerable breathing space in which to conduct a more efficient referendum campaign . opinion polls conducted in recent weeks indicate that ybs commands a strong majority , from 62 % to 23 % , with more than 15 % of voters undecided . but the picture is far from clear-cut .
finally , the eu must do more to develop its financial toolkit and promote europe ’s international use . a decision to reject a merger or permit an investment that benefits a politically motivated foreign competitor could make economic sense while raising eyebrows in foreign-policy circles . eu member states already have such practices in place , and so should the eu . a decision to reject a merger or permit an investment that benefits a politically motivated foreign competitor might make economic sense while raising eyebrows in foreign-policy circles . to this end , in a forthcoming paper that i co-authored with foreign-policy experts and other economists , we suggest that the eu high representative for foreign affairs and security issues should be given the right to object on security grounds to the european commission ’s proposed mergers or investment decisions .
whereas the west has lost no time in imposing sanctions against president vladimir putin ’s russia following its annexation of crimea , it has not punished israel for its occupation of the palestinian territories . ngos focused on human rights and peacemaking are scrutinized as foreign agents . whereas the west has lost little time in imposing sanctions against president vladimir putin ’s russia following its annexation of crimea , it has not punished israel for its occupation of the palestinian land . for israel , the need for democracy has always been a strategic asset , because a democratic israel was a natural convenience in a western alliance . the more israel embraces putin-inspired practices , however , the diminished becomes its links to its strategic rearguard in the west .
mr. romano prodi , the president of the eu commission and a former prime minister of italy , responded to president bush 's most recent declaration by saying that “ if one wants to be a world leader , one must know how to look after the entire earth , not just american industry . " but this question is not only one for those aspiring world leaders . to whatever extent should political leaders see their roles narrowly in terms of their citizens ' interests , and to what extent should they be worrying about human welfare everywhere ? in kosovo , funding intervention to air bombardment made this strategy a total success : nato forces suffered not just a single casualty in combat but around 300 kosovar , 209 serb , and 3 chinese civilians . this approach to the duties of a national leader , made explicit and sincere , forces us to think about the basic ethical issue .
in europe , the kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy , particularly given hungary ’s decision to suspend the gas flow to ukraine . on both of these fronts , the eu ’s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that europe is repeatedly out-maneuvered by russian president vladimir putin . indeed , the situation in ukraine represents a tactical victory for russia , with an fragile but enduring ceasefire , and the accompanying legislation that grants donetsk and luhansk substantial political autonomy , permitting russia to ameliorate the conflict near the eu ’s borders . moreover , delayed implementation of key elements of the eu ’s association agreement with ukraine provides clear evidence that , at present , russia dictates the terms of eu-ukrainian engagement . looking ahead , ukraine increasingly appears to be becoming locked in a “ frozen conflict ” ” ” ” involving russia ’s foreign-policy brinkmanship .
with the weakness of the dollar hanging like damocles ’ sword of damocles over the global economy , almost everyone laments america ’s spendthrift assignments . with the weakness of the dollar hanging like damocles ’ sword of damocles over the global economy , almost everyone laments america ’s spendthrift ways . but has it ever come to the head of anybody , how hard americans have to work to ensure everybody else to look good ? the chronic debt-crisis countries , from mexico to brazil to russia to south korea , are all fighting capital inflows from investors seeking an exit as the us dollar collapses . by america ’s gaping trade deficits , the biggest headache of any developing country ’s finance minister nowadays tries to keep his or her country on the brink of exit as the us dollar collapses .
new york – hurricane harvey left behind in his ignominiously upended lives and huge property damage , estimated by some at the time of his $ 150-180 billion . but researchers have long predicted that such increases would boost not only average temperatures , but also weather variability , and especially the occurrence of extreme events like hurricane harvey . of course , no particular climatic event can do directly to increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . but the rains that inundated the coast of texas for the better part of a week , and the hurricane hitting south florida in particular , raise deep questions about the united states ’ economic system and politics . to be sure , it is ironic that an event so much of an event involving climate change would take place in a state that is home to so many climate-change deniers , and where the economy depends so heavily on the fossil-fuel industry that is driving global warming .
rather than banding together together , each new challenge has split the eu into an ever-smaller group . europe has divided the north and south ; ukraine and the refugee crisis have divided east and west . the eu was built on the mechanical notion that the interdependence would reduce conflict . by linking europe together , first through the european coal and steel community , and later through the common market and the eu , the eu hoped to bind europeans together so closely that the war between the two would no longer be an option . pro-europeans need to get involved with the sources of discontent and rethink the forms they used to express the european ideal .
in nigeria these days , a key issue nowadays is not whether president olusegun obasanjo will quit after his second ( and finish ) term expires next year , but who will succeed him . unfortunately , this , too , is n’t necessarily the president ’s performance at home . attempts by obasanjo ’s supporters to persuade the national assembly to amend the constitution so that obasanjo can continue in office beyond two terms meet with a solid wall of opposition . government and business activities virtually ground to block this spring as democracy activists , in alliance with political and legislators opposed to a third term , battled obasanjo ’s allies to thwart the proposed bill . given nigeria ’s history of sit-tight military dictatorships , this is genuine progress .
if parfit is right , there is far less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we are all thinking back to it . he discusses three leadership theories on what we take for granted , one deriving from kant ’s social-contract tradition of hobbes , locke , rousseau and contemporary philosophers , john rawls and t.m. parfit , and one of bentham ’s bentham ’s utilitarianism , and argues that kantian and social-contract theories must be revised to be defensible . he then argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism , that theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism . defenders of each of these theories are , in parfit ’s vivid phrase , “ climbing the same mountain on various sides . ” parfit ’s reaction to this line of argument leads him to assert an assertion that is perhaps even bolder in his defenses of objectivism on ethics .
this is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding out from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years . but this does not mean that the corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism , even though its various stakeholders apparently can spend any part of the income that they earn from their companies and other sources in altruistic ways . instead of csr , we should have psr ( personal social responsibility ) . this is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – the two object of lawsuits in recent years . one can also argue for the psr on the grounds that asking for csr will become the way of “ passing the buck ” ” – evading personal accountability for doing good .
tokyo – hillary clinton ’s recent trip to asia may one day be viewed as her most significant visit to the region , by a us diplomat since henry kissinger ’s secret mission to beijing in july 1971 . the revival of us-chinese relations shifted the global balance of power in the cold war ’s height , preparing the way for china to open up its economy , a decision that , more than any other , defined today ’s world . so far , clinton ’s tour has produced the clearest signals yet that america is reluctant to embrace china ’s push for regional hegemony . what clinton did , and said during her asian tour , will mark either the end of an era that kissinger initiated four decades ago , or the start of a distinct new phase in that epoch . kissinger ’s tour produced the clearest signals yet that america is unwilling to accept china ’s push for regional hegemony .
chinese demand is not only growing ; as incomes continue to rise , its composition is shifting toward more sophisticated goods and services . meanwhile , rising chinese incomes imply structural change for china , because continued growth presupposes a shift to higher-value manufacturing activities . thus , china ’s role changes : once the west has a low-cost supplier to the west , it is now becoming a major customer for western products . this represents a major opportunity for advanced economies to rebalance their sources of growth and employment , provided they are positioned to compete for appropriate components of evolving supply chains . at the same time , rising chinese incomes imply structural change for china , because continued growth presupposes a shift toward higher-value activities .
macron ’s own rhetoric suggests that he wants to combat these symptoms . for his part , macron ’s hyper-active diplomacy exposes some post-imperial inferiority complex , symptoms that , whether brexit or putinism , limit europe ’s normalization , and hampering the eu ’s mobilization to counterbalance china and the united states . historically , french diplomacy excels in grand bargains . but , under merkel , germany has evaded such agreements , preferring the status quo , or incremental change , as it usually wound up paying extra power . macron ’s own rhetoric suggests that he wants to fight these symptoms .
at the same time , they fail to grasp the obvious fact that their economies remain too closely interconnected for an independent economic policy to function . dublin – europe ’s needs , and the europeans ’ aspirations are at a odds . at a time when powerful , we need coordinated action to stave off financial collapse in the european union , the popular support that drove european integration over the past six decades is in the offing . after almost 70 years of peacemaking , europeans seem to have forgotten why unity was so important , indulging nationalist sentiment , without regard for its potential implications . at the same time , they abided by electoral politics ’ confinement on individual countries that forces policymakers to pretend that they could address economic issues with national policies on their own .
a full assessment of the war in iraq and its effects on the middle east will take a decade or more . for one thing , it is still too early to judge the merits of this argument . national elections have been in lebanon and local elections in saudi arabia over the past six months . clearly , the january 2005 elections were a positive step for the region . the skeptics have a point , but they go too far .
as thomas mann once wrote : “ freedom is more complicated than power . it highlights the contrast between initiative and apathy , enterprise and obedience , competition , and total dependence on a state that embody a kind of unshakable fate . ” freedom changes the frame and the substance of choice , as well as of individual and collective responsibility . it highlights the contrast between initiative and apathy , enterprise and obedience , competition , and total dependence on a state that embody a sort of unshakable fate . in 1989 , the region ’s peoples brought with them in their “ go back to europe ” in their diversity and richness ; their vivacity , mysteries , memory ; and their old and new aspirations .
cambridge – major tax reform is high on the united states ’ agenda in 2017 . the republican-controlled house of representatives has been preparing for that for years , creating detailed schemes to liberalize how corporate and personal incomes are taxed . the proposed corporate-tax reform is particularly large . now , with a republican majority in both the senate and a republican president in the white house , those plans may lay the groundwork for legislative action . i believe that it will have a highly favorable effect on business investment , increased productivity , and overall economic growth .
palme and oskar lafontaine , then one of the opposition leaders in germany , did not view the cold war as primarily the conflict between freedom and tyranny . when palme visited east germany in 1984 , he never criticized repression there , nor the berlin wall . instead , palme praised east germans ’ leader , erich honecker , undercut shared goals , and mutual struggle for peace and development . palme ’s main speech referred to “ détente , ” “ trust , ” and “ friendships , ” but never “ freedom ” . this alliance between the two parties led to a serious distortions in fundamental western values .
the un , like the dream of european unity , was also part of the 1945 consensus . a different type of revolution took hold in europe ’s former colonies in asia , where native peoples had no desire to be ruled once more by western powers , which had such ignomininominiously defeated japan . vietnamese , indonesians , filipinos , burmese , indians , and malays desire their freedom as well . the un , like the dream of european unity , was also part of the 1945 consensus . a different sort of revolution took place in europe ’s former colonies in asia , where native peoples had little or no desire to be ruled once more by western powers , which held that ignominiously defeated japan .
guided by one of the problem ’s architects , hank paulson , who advocated for deregulation and allowing banks to take on even more leveraging , it is no surprise that the administration veered from one policy toward the next , supporting absolute conviction , until minutes before abandoning the rest of the financial system . even if confidence did indeed matter , the us economy would flounder . but the financial crisis is just one of a few crises facing the country : the underlying macroeconomic problem has been made worse by sinking fortunes to the bottom half of the us population . those who would spend do not have that money , and those with money are not spending . moreover , what little action has taken has been aimed at re-politicizing the us financial system .
cambridge – amid the foreign-capital bonanza , stagnant levels of private investment in tradable goods signal that no amount of government mythmaking should be allowed override . at the center of the foreign-capital bonanza , stagnant levels of private investment in tradable goods signal a particularly powerful danger signal that no amount of government mythmaking should be allowed override . the policy dilemmas that have resulted from rising inequality , more volatility , decreased room to manage the real economy , and will continue to dominate policymakers ’ minds in the decades ahead . the deeper issue lies with the over-financialization of the global economy that have arisen since the 1990s . officials face a simple choice : maintain strong prudential controls on capital inflows , or be ready to invest large amounts of resources in self-insurance by accumulating large foreign reserves .
even a relatively small amount of materials like cobalt-60 – used in radiotherapy – could cause serious damage , if combined with conventional explosives in the so-called “ dirty bomb ” ( or otherwise deliberately used to expose the public to dangerous climats ) . the proposed change would oblige countries to safeguard nuclear material when it is deployed or siphoned off , not just when it is transported internationally , as is so often the case . that will be the first such event , which is open to any country . foreign and energy ministries will have an opportunity to strengthen the global nuclear security framework when they convene at the international nuclear conference when they met at the international atomic energy conference : enhancing global efforts on july 1-5 . at the asean agenda summit should be subject to ratification of improvements to the critical nuclear security apparatus , theconvention of nuclear protection .
this time around , the initiative came from singh , who invited his pakistani counterpart , prime minister yousuf raza gilani , to visit mohali , near new delhi , to watch over the two countries play the semifinal in the cricket world cup . the matches were played on march 30 , with pakistan losing narrowly . it balked at sitting next to singh to watch the game ; but , ultimately , the process , rather than the protocol , will determine how the bilateral relationship moves forward . on the political side , however , both countries were not evenly matched . of the troika , which currently holds pakistan , the president , vice premier yousuf raza gilani , to visit mohali , near new delhi , to watch the two countries play the semifinal in the cricket world cup .
indonesia argues that a nation ’s right to control all information on locally discovered viruses should be protected through the same mechanisms that the un food and agriculture organization uses to guarantee poor countries ’ ownership rights of ownership and patents on the seeds of their indigenous plant . this useful policy reduces exploitative practices , which sometimes enable multinationals and wealthy governments to extract outrageous profits from indigenous agriculture . it is dangerous folly , however , to stretch this policy up to the viruses . indonesia argues that a nation ’s ’s right to control all information on locally discovered viruses should be protected through the same mechanisms that the un food and agriculture organization uses to guarantee poor countries ’ ownership rights of ownership and patents on the seeds of their indigenous plants . under the fao seed accord , a nation can register plants , shared their seeds , and derive profits from the resulting products .
from 1992 to 2011 , unit labor costs have grown at an average annual rate of 0.9 % , the lowest of the oecd . this , in turn , demands to increase investment in innovation and human capital . from 1992 to 2011 , italy ’s share of global exports has been growing faster than real gdp and employment , undermining the economy ’s competitiveness vis-à-vis the developing world . italy ’s new government ’s greatest challenge will be implementing reforms that enable italy ’s economic performance to catch up to that of its neighbors after years of poor policies and neglect . italy ’s share of global exports has fallen from 3.9 % in 2000 to 2.9 % in 2004 .
but technical capability is not the only or even the main part of the question . policy wonks think of themselves as the unbiased purveyors of high-quality , evidence-based advice . there is a misconception at work here . informed citizens reasonably fear that the wonk in question may be in thrall to a particular ideology or methodology ; that the councils might be politically motivated ; or that the advisers might tailor their own career concerns ( how to get that plum ’s job on wall street after government leaves the country , for example ) . conflicting motivations are probably an even more fundamental reason why citizens are growing distrust among experts .
disillusionment with politics is on the rise , and perhaps even brings forth the right-wing populists , whom a democratic germany has so far been spared . whichever party combination emerges on the upper hand -- and helmut kohl ’s governing coalition still must be seen as a narrow favorite -- enjoying a meager majority , depending on any major initiative on the unlikely support of his political adversaries . so germany appears destined to become stuck in the doldrums for some time . while exports are booming , unemployment remains stubbornly high , joblessness remains stubbornly high . the price for inaction is high .
europe ’s status as the world ’s largest trading bloc , with nearly 40 % of all international commerce and europe ’s increasing prominence , in a crisis notwithstanding – as a reserve currency – means that the eu , just like america ’s , can set the agenda for dealing with the new global rulebook . europe ’s leadership on climate change and development aid could , if well handled , provide an essential foundation for a new moral authority . the difference is that america acts decisively . of course , europe occupies the morality of high ground that america has mostly vacillation , owing to its mis-adventures in iraq and afghanistan . but there is little sign that governments that are exploiting this opportunity .
madrid – having secured a fifth term ( and his fourth in a row ) as israel ’s prime minister , binyamin netanyahu is well on his way to surpassing david ben-gurion , the state ’s founding father , like his country ’s longest-serving leader . and that shift would be occurring at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world . as september p. hartley wrote in go-it-alone opening up : “ the past is a foreign country : they are doing things very different there . yet netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s israel would hardly have been recognizable to ben-gurion , who strived to combine the country ’s jewish character with democracy . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
in september 2008 , for example , former polish president roman herzog published a polemic entitled “ suspended the ecj ! ” in september 2008 , for example , former polish president roman herzog published a polemic entitled “ stop the ecj ! ” such arguments were deployed successfully during the 2005 referenda on the eu constitutional treaty in france and the netherlands , and in ireland during the referendum over the lisbon treaty . he charged that the luxembourg judges grabbing ever-greater competences at the expense of member states , and urged the constitutional court to invalidate a series of controversial ecj rulings . herzog ’s broadside resonated over europe , where for some time there has been significant disquiet over “ judicial activism ” and what some see as an irreversible trend toward the ecj ’s empowerment and other eu institutions . in many member states , the ecj ’s rulings have produced a backlash , most notably on the left , with trade unions and social movements targeting the court ’s purported zeal in siding with business over workers ’ interests .
that means shifting the focus away from back-ward-looking labor-market policies , which seek to protect workers in existing jobs , toward future-oriented measures , like innovative insurance mechanisms , and active labor-market policies . on both of these fronts , france sets a positive example . moreover , social contracts based on formal long-term employer-employee relationships will have to become overhauled , with benefits like retirement and health care made more portable and adjusted to evolving occupational arrangements , including the expanding “ gig ” economy . moreover , social contracts based on formal long-term employer-employee relationships will need to become overhauled , with benefits like retirement and health care made more portable and adjusted to evolving workarrangements , including the expanding “ gig ” economy . at the same time , following through on reform of its labor markets and social safety nets , countries will need to ease workers ’ skills .
as barbara general robert caslen , the pentagon ’s deputy director for the war on terrorism , put it , “ we are not killing them more rapidly than they are being created . according to caslen , “ we in the pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or to train them . ” the manner in which the us uses military power also affects rumsfeld ’s ratio . in the aftermath of 9/11 , a good deal of sympathy and understanding has emerged around the world for america ’s military response against the taliban . the us , too , is failing in applying soft power .
our study concludes that india could experience faster economic and industrial growth , higher rates of energy use , and a cleaner environment . yet this is not what has happened so far in the past . air , soil , and water pollution have skyrocketed , compounding hundreds of thousands of deaths each year . the key to a pure future is clean-tech , whose costs have been falling steadily and will continue to do so . at times , such technologies pay lip service to themselves , and will adopt it .
likewise , skilled teachers can now deliver interactive e-lessons to the many classrooms at once , however hundreds of miles away . for example , some providers are developing classroom models in which students can watch teacher-created videos online outside of class , so that precious teacher-student face time can focus on interacting rather than lecturing . likewise , skilled teachers can now deliver interactive e-lessons to the many classrooms at once , even as they are hundreds of miles away . after all , a lecture from a good teacher – even when one is being sent over online – is preferable to confronting time with untrained adults . furthermore , the private sector is bringing innovation to its classrooms , too .
to help these domestic powerhouses rise in their market leverage , the administration often favors them at the expense of their foreign competitors . when the us congress takes up the debate over climate change , for example , and some legislators are calling for the cap-and-trade scheme , others will demand to know why america should accept binding emissions-reduction commitments while the chinese refuse . at the same time , the obama administration has moved against chinese exports of apparel and steel pipelines ; but this year ’s confrontation will extend well beyond trade . moreover , the chinese government has been investing heavily in state-owned companies in recent years and in privately-owned “ national ” champions , ” ” ” ” ” ” largely to ensure that china gains from power in markets , while its leadership controls as much of the spoils as possible . to assist these domestic powerhouses of their market leverage , the us government often favors them at the expense of its foreign competitors .
so , although central banks are not inclined to give up on their formal 2 % inflation objective , they are also reluctant to prolong the timeline for reaching it , as they have already done time and again , effectively conceding that inflation may remain low for longer . otherwise , they would have to sustain for much longer their unconventional monetary policies , including quantitative easing and negative policy rates , an approach with which most central banks ( with the potential exception of the bank of japan ) are uncomfortable . but continuing for much longer with unconventional monetary policies also carry the risk of undesirable asset-price inflation , excessive credit growth , and bubbles . this central bank patience risks de-anchoring inflationary expectations a downward spiral . but , confronted with the possibility that today ’s low-inflation may be triggered by persistent supply shocks , they are also reluctant to ease the timeline for achieving it , because they have already done time and again , effectively conceding that inflation may stay low for longer .
what would persuade chinese leaders that they must quickly reinforce an open global economy that has enabled china ’s export-driven economic rise ? a contest for global leadership might serve that purpose , rather than an attractive possibility , would be a matter of necessity . what would persuade chinese leaders that they must quickly reinforce an open global economy that has enabled china ’s export-driven economic rise ? one such catalyst might be the financial crisis emanating from the country ’s risk-laden shadow-banking system . a contest for global leadership might serve that purpose just as it is .
at a time of rising unemployment , with france dominating worries about the future , the french need a reassuring father or a mother figure , rather than a jittery and manipulative leaderready to compromise the ethics , and france a proud tradition that every citizen has the right to equal treatment under the law . not so much sarkozy ’s performance as president that most frenchmen reject ; they are his own essence . winston churchill ’s notorious denunciation of delaying tactics by the british and french on the eve of world war ii should serve as a warning to french president nicolas sarkozy . in fanning the vicious anti-immigrant passions of short-term political gain , he will have dishonor first and then defeat . in fanning vicious anti-immigrant passions for short-term political gain , he will have dishonor first and then defeat .
at the same time , the international community must encourage the integration of refugees in major host countries like turkey , kenya , lebanon , and jordan . millions end up in protracted displacement , spending an estimated 25 years on average stuck in limbo , unsure of where they could return home . as it stands , countries receive just a fraction of the $ 3,000-5,000 needed annually to provide adequate housing , food , health care , schooling , and job training during their first several years of displacement . in 2016 , developed countries should agree to accept a combined total of approaching one million refugees annually , either through resettlement or through the issuance of humanitarian , student , labor , and other visas . with canada alone indicating that it will resettle 50,000 syrian refugees this year , it is clearly achievable .
berkeley – inequality stands on the popular mind almost everywhere nowadays . yet , on both countries , it has historically been some sort of social inequalities that have been on the decline in recent decades . in india , certain historically disadvantaged groups ( especially among lower-castes ) are now politically assertive . in india , certain historically disadvantaged groups ( especially among lower-castes ) are now politically assertive . the most egregious vestiges of caste discrimination are gradually receding .
but with unemployment continuing to rise in the heavily indebted southern countries , and output continuing to lag far behind germany and other northern european countries . the main drivers of lag are not simply low demand or large debt . there is a vast difference between unit labor costs , real ( inflation-adjusted ) productivity wages – in germany and the heavily indebted southern european countries – in germany . when the crisis hit , production costs in greece were about 30 % higher than in germany , so greece has exported very little and has imported very much . production costs in other heavily indebted countries have been 20-25 % higher than in germany .
and yet , just as ukrainians are working to rebuild our country after viktor yanukovych ’s predatory rule , the us is confronting a new threat , within the form of a us-putin “ peace offensive ” that the old staple of soviet diplomacy designed to undermine western resolve . putin ’s gambit is akin to the infamous yalta conference of 1945 , where joseph stalin made winston churchill and franklin d. roosevelt made winston churchill complicit in dividing europe , which has enslaved half of the continent for nearly a half-century . russian president vladimir putin ’s recent telephone call to us president barack obama to seek renewed diplomatic talks , followed by a russian white paper on how to resolve the kremlin ’s making , constitutes a peace offensive that is actually offensive to peace . most important , despite the russian military ’s massed opposition to the us , the us is embarking on an election campaign . russian president vladimir putin ’s recent phone call to us president barack obama to seek renewed diplomatic talks , followed by a russian white paper over our supposed failure to uphold democracy .
in 1973 , dimona ’s defenders downed a wayward libyan civilian airliner heading to the reactor , killing 108 people . but the 1991 persian gulf war upset whatever solace israel could take from the recent history . hezbollah ’s bombardment of northern israel in 2006 further demonstrated the country ’s vulnerability to a us missile attack . by 1973 , dimona ’s defenders downed a wayward libyan civilian airliner headed for the reactor , killing 108 people . and , while israel ’s ’s ’s ’s arrow ballistic missile defenses , which now surround dimona , may be superior to the failed patriot plan in 1991 , syria ’s more advanced scuds and iran ’s shahab 3 rocket present a more competent challenge than saddam ’s projectiles .
until recently , investors had hoped that america ’s federal reserve would do whatever it takes to avoid a recession , because that is what it has done on previous occasions . now , they must recognize that the fed may no longer be in a strong position to do so . if interest rates were falling beyond a certain point , the dollar would nonetheless come under renewed pressure , and long-term bond yields would in fact go up in yields . moreover , the finance authorities ’ ability to stimulate the economy is being constrained by the unwillingness of the rest of the world to accumulate an additional dollar reserves . if the interest rate were to fall beyond a certain point , the dollar would give it whatever it takes to avoid a recession , because that is what it has done on previous occasions .
as us secretary of state hillary clinton put it in the newsweek issue , “ the world needs to think more strategically and creatively about tapping into women ’s potential for growth . ” but , on the planet worst , forcing frightened , uneducated women to remain at home is more socially palatable than facing the fact that this means choosing to drag down incomes for everyone . well-educated , pushy mothers make all the difference . studies show that helping women access trade and grow firms helps to create jobs and boost incomes . and , when they marry and have their own children , they benefit from two highly educated , employed parents , which means twice as much literate home conversation , twice links , and twice the encouragement to succeed .
until the 1990s , the british euro-skeptics coined the term the “ anglosphere ” to describe a model that was both more successful and more expansionary than actually without the eu . as a result , britain has lost much of its capacity for making an effective contribution to european reform . one of the factors driving the uk to gain ’s sense of unease in its relations with an increasingly bureaucratized europe are the belief that its values and institutions move closer to those of the us or to other english-speaking former colonies . until the 1990s , the british euroskeptics coined the term of the “ anglosphere ” to describe a model that was more successful and expansionary than that of the us .
but the battle between pro- and anti-europeans is masking what really is at stake , and therefore what should be the focus of the eu ’s electoral debate : how europe can deliver sustained economic growth . broad-based recovery – in investment , demand , and employment – is the best weapon with which to confront those who would destroy the european project . the upcoming elections will render the public ’s verdict on the success or failure of the austerity policies that have been going on . but it will also determine whether europe can remain the world ’s leading economic power , maintain its social model , and safeguard its context of rights and liberties in a world that does not wait until europeans can resolve their differences . that kind of question , rather than a never-ending defense of euroskepticism , should be the main item in party deliberation for parties pushing for an improved europe for all .
and who before july 1998 believed that a russian default would unleash the global financial panic ? everyone agrees that ecuador posed no systemic risk ( though this was imminent ! ) , but what about brazil ? the mexican crisis of 1994-1995 saw such a systemic risk from washington , but not from most european capitals . then there is the concept of systemic risk , one that exists not only in the eye of the beholder , but may be impossible to predict . the mexican crisis of 1994-1995 seen systemic risk from washington , but not from most european capitals .
competitiveness , usually measured in terms of unit labor costs , is a relative concept . but this approach risks leading in the wrong direction . the eurozone ’s ’s southern members must reduce their wage costs to claw back the competitiveness that they have lost since adopting the common currency . likewise , concern over such divergences has reached a task force , spearheaded by european union president herman van rompuy , to devise fundamental reforms to the rules-based economic-policy coordination . a crucial proposal from the task force at first meeting was to develop the indicators of competitiveness , and then force member countries to take on the “ remedial ” indicators should the eu find large spreads .
mexico city – during the spanish civil war , thousands of young americans went to spain to join the fight against fascism as part of a brigade of “ abraham lincoln ’s brigade . ” today , just as more people are awakening to the threat that american president donald trump poses to the rule of law , human rights , and the international order , a new worldwide resistance movement is emerging around the world to defend democracy and basic decency . after all , the resistance has been able to adopt three tactics . one approach is simply to wait and hope that trump is turned into a lame duck by damning revelations about his administration . today , just as more people are waking up to the threat that american president donald trump poses to the rule of law , human rights , and the international order , a new global resistance movement is emerging around defending democracy and basic decency .
if americans had to pay more for gasoline , they would take advantage of less of it in higher-gasoline prices , alternative energy sources like ethanol , and alternative forms of transportation like a electric-vehicle would have become commercially viable . in the short run , americans would have to make modest economic sacrifices . and no single measure would do more to lower global oil consumption than the sharply rising price of a country ’s gasoline tax , which has consumes more of it than any other : the united states . no single measure would do more to make the world a less dangerous place than a significant reduction in its own oil consumption . in the short run , america would have to make modest economic sacrifices .
new york – internet firms are supposed to be all of the cutting edge , but reality and buzz , sometimes of conflict . consider groupon : its targeting is the power of its groups , but its real business is the old standby direct-mail and its coupons . the model obviously makes sense for many customers : groupon now has more than 50 million subscribers , and its goal of becoming 150 million by year-end . but groupon is spreading that model to a much broader audience – not so much to its coupon users , but instead to merchants offer the coupons . in fact , groupon does for e-mail marketing what other internet firms do for yellow pages or classified advertisements : encouraging merchants to use modern technology to reach their customers .
the prevailing view holds that the downward trend largely reflects a fall in equilibrium or “ natural ” real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates , driven by changes in saving and investment fundamentals . again , how to stem the decline in equilibrium rates has become the subject of the lively debate . this perceived downside to “ natural ” interest rates is viewed as the key barrier to economic recovery , because it impedes monetary policy ’s capacity to provide sufficient stimulus by pushing real rates below their equilibrium levels , owing to the zero bound on nominal rates . conspicuously absent from the discussion , however , has been the role played by financial factors in explaining the trend decline in real rates . in other words , higher willingness to save in emerging economies , together with a growing preference for safe assets , has raised the flow of savings worldwide , even as persistently weak growth prospects and heightened insecurity in the advanced economies have depressed investment demand .
as enrico moretti of the university of california at berkeley , has emphasized in his book the new job geography , the salience of this new divide is perfect : university graduates account for one-half of the total population in the extremely affluent us metropolitan areas , but are four times less numerous in worse-off zones . in fascinating new research , mit ’s david autor and his co-authors have explored the political effects . they find that american districts , where the economy has been badly hit by chinese exports , have reacted by replacing moderate representatives with more radical policymakers – either from the left or the right . economic shocks tend to exacerbate this political dividing line . they find that american districts , where the us economy has been badly hit by chinese exports , have responded by replacing moderate representatives with more radical policymakers – either from the left or the right .
the un commission of inquiry gathered intelligence identifying some of these responsibility for crimes it investigated , but it did not make it publicly . failing to respond , or if its response is not persuasive , their biases , and the crimes they ascribe to the un human rights council , should only go public . those to be named should be noted , either by the commission or by yet another body created by the un human rights council . the very names of those responsible should be made public , either . the human rights council could act .
but , with center-right leaders at the helm , the january 7 offensive could spur a renewed sense of both a collective purpose and a political revival . in fact , the scars of colonialism are fresher in france than almost everywhere in europe ; the country has europe of the largest muslim minority ; and , with moderates seeming especially weak and split , the extreme right cresting in opinion polls . already , le pen seems poised to return to the shape of a disaster . so she seems able to present herself as a recipe for a disaster . “ national unity ” is a empathetic political maneuver , ” she complained , after not invited to the rally in the day after the attacks .
that means raising capital and human-capital intensity across both the economy ’s tradable and non-tradable sectors . on the tradable side , one should look to structural change and an output shift to higher-value-added components of global supply chains . here , innovation , and the conditions that support it – including competition and free entry and exit from the market – play an important role . when policymakers select a model based on a huge state-dominated sector shielded from domestic and external competition , innovation goals are unlikely to be fulfilled , adversely affecting future growth . in the meantime , the non-tradable side is likely to grow .
this has been the case in russia , which , since president vladimir putin ’s first-ever electoral victory in 2000 , has now become a potemkin democracy . then there are the cases where a leader ’s election moves , neither free nor fair , will lead to putin ’s next term in office . consider those cases when election empower a majority in ethnic or religious communities , containing roughshod over minorities , an outcome that has seen all too often in the balkans , for example . to be sure , elections by themselves do n’t make a democracy . this year , another election , neither free nor fair , will give putin another term in office .
but iranians are nothing like the nazis , and there is no country like the soviet union posing the kind of threat that inspired us president richard nixon to head to beijing in 1972 . equally problematic has been the propensity to compare the two sets of negotiations . beyond timing , they have little in common . what they do share is that their “ success ” was driven largely by the sense that powerful external threats made the alternative , no deal , at all , far worse . in greece ’s case , negotiations propelled the specter of embittered greece cozying up to russian president vladimir putin with his dangerous revisionist ambition or acting as a conduit for europe – tied to migrants .
what if that advantage comes from exploiting the performance-enhancing drug ? integrity seems an old-fashioned idea , but it is at the heart of who we are and how we live . if we ban drugs in the scientific games , we owe it to athletes to be able to deter , detect , and punish those who are cheating . for athletes wishing to compete clean , a threat that they might beat back a competitor that is not faster , stronger , or more dedicated ; but who takes the drug to gain the edge is profoundly personal . when drugs are prohibited , but some athletes take advantage of them , anyway , to play field tilts in favor of a cheater .
this sketch of the crisis emphasizes how much has changed in the subsequent 20 years . for starters , the crises countries ratcheted up their investment rates and growth expectations toward the sustainable tier . more generally , countries have felt pressure from the imf and the u.s. treasury to remove capital-flow restrictions , which have heightened the risks and made maintaining pegged exchange rates ever more problematic . south korea ’s admission to the oecd has required its government to dismantle capital controls , exposing the economy to the inflow of short-term “ hot money . ” the external powers , meanwhile , have compounded the problem .
the renminbi is approaching , but not before 2020 , by which shanghai will become a world-class international financial center . beyond this , the dollar is already going nowhere . one thing that could precipitate the demise of the us dollar would be reckless economic mismanagement in america . and , even then , the renminbi probably will share the international stage against the us dollar , rather than substitute for it . one thing that could precipitate the demise of the us dollar would be reckless economic mismanagement in america .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the us is deeply concerned with the direction in which the bush administration takes the united states and the world . i have committed $ 10 million to “ america coming together , ” ( act ) ’s grass-roots get-roots , and $ 2.5 million to the ba’moveon.org voter fund , “ the popular internet advocacy group that airing advertisements to highlight the administration ’s misdeeds . ” i and many other affluent americans are contributing millions of dollars to paypal -roots organizations engaged in the 2004 presidential race . if american voters endorse these policies , america needs to live with bush ’s hostility to the world , and to tolerate a vicious cycle of escalating violence . if this effort , i have committed $ 10 million to “ america coming together , ” ( act ) a grass-roots get-roots , and $ 2.5 million to the ba’moveon.org voter fund , “ the popular internet advocacy group that airing advertisements to highlight the administration ’s misdeeds . ”
after america ’s own peace negotiations with the afghan taliban have failed , and almost 30 years after the end of the decade-long soviet occupation of the country , the kremlin has stepped in to mediate , much less underwrite , durable peace agreements . but russia is likely to disappoint its supporters in the middle east , not least as a regional peace broker . whereas russia has not overstepped america , 20 % of the respondents cited the country as their “ best friend ” outside the middle east and north africa . there is little reason to think that russia , which has never been particularly inclined toward prolonged peace-building , will be able to mediate , much less underwrite , durable peace agreements . while russia has not overstepped america , 20 % of respondents cited the country as their “ best friend ” outside the middle east and north africa .
and that amount partly reflects the fact that the employed , those who collect social security and medicare , are subject to the payroll tax that they receive . but experience shows that the decision to retire or work fewer hours affects the compensation that members of that group receive . moreover , because of the elaborate rules that govern the level of social security , an older worker paying this payroll tax most likely receives no extra benefit . for many older workers , the choice is not whether to work , but how much . the payroll tax that employee pay is 6.65 % ( employers pay the same rate ) and add to personal income taxes .
up to now , the eu ’s interest in kaliningrad has centered on how to restrict the visa rights that oblast ’s citizens now use to traverse poland and the baltic states so as to visit the rest of russia . should this fails , however , the contrasts between kaliningrad and the rest of the region will be shamefully striking . the eu must forge close cooperation with both russia ’s leaders , as well as the baltic region from which so many new eu members will be coming to the fore . the eu ’s enlargement will create huge impetus for europe as a whole , especially the baltic region from which so many new eu members will now arrive . up to now , the eu ’s interest in the kaliningrad will increase trade and economic growth , and this could provide genuine incentives to make kaliningrad a more attractive neighbor and trading partner , rather than only a feared source of illegal russian migrants to the eu seize a supposedly lax visa regime .
lev artsimovich , the tokamak of ’s inventor , has said that “ fusion will be ready when the society needs it . ” but , rather than depending on fusion researchers to obscure the odds , the world should be stepping up technology ’s investment . in the absence of nuclear fusion , the future generation of energy options will severely limit it , creating a serious problem for both developed and developing countries alike . one hopes that it is right , and that it is only right . our future may , therefore , depend on it , but we do our own .
this mismanagement should disqualify any eurozone policymaker from the imf ’s governance directorship , and yet christine lagarde , the french finance minister , was named to have the succeed her compatriot dominique strauss-kahn following her resignation . furthermore , europeans dominate the fund ’s leadership . it is an discomforting conflict of interest that the debtors dominate an international institution that lends them enormous sums . it is the discomforting conflict of interest that the debtors dominate an international institution that lends them enormous sums . an obvious explanation for the imf ’s extraordinary gamble is that the managing director who made the decision to support greece so heavily hailed from the eurozone , and at the time christine lagarde , french finance minister , was named to succeed her compatriot dominique strauss-kahn following his resignation .
so the three problems europe is facing in the second half of this year are intimately connected . in fact , the eu will need the strongest leadership team that it can find to steer through its treacherous waters and forward financial-sector reforms . meanwhile , there are few fresh faces or ideas on the horizon , all of which are on the ground . just now , the signs are far from promising . there are few fresh faces or ideas on the horizon .
a more nuanced approach would focus on eliminating the underlying , interconnected barriers that women face in getting nominated for the elected office and conducting successful campaigns . such obstacles include the election system itself ( women fare better under proportional representation than they do in first-past-the-post systems that are based on single-member districts ) ; lack of access to financing ; weakened professional networks ; and outside responsibilities making it harder to take on punishing and unforeseeable work conditions . overcoming such structural barriers will require establishing a comprehensive strategy for promotion of women candidates . one of the most powerful tools we have in common is that of money ; now we need to do just that . in many countries , costs of campaigning are becoming prohibitively high for most aspirants , regardless of gender .
this reflects both a public investment deficiency and an information gap : investing in job training in a rapidly evolving industrial structure is like shooting the start . powerful technological and global market forces are not confined to any single country . taken together , these adverse trends date back to some of the 1980 ’s . the same issues arise everywhere , with different outcomes reflecting variability in market flexibility and social-policy choices . given imperfect information about long-term needs , labor markets are out of equilibrium .
wikipedia ’s boosters trumpet it as heralding the advent of “ web 2.0 . ” the sharp divide between manufacturers and knowledge consumers began only about 300 years ago , when book printers secured royal protection in an effort to confront piracy in the rapidly expanding literary market . the legacy of their achievement , the copyright laws , continues to impede attempts to render cyberspace a free marketplace of thought . but we have been here before – indeed , for most human history . whereas “ web 1.0 ” has facilitated the storage and transmission of vast amounts of various kinds of information in cyberspace , “ web 2.0 ” supposedly renders the entire process interactive , removing the final frontier separating the transmitter and receiver of information .
that is somewhat ironic : removing the uk from the ecj ’s jurisdiction is now one of may ’s principal aims . luxembourg , frankfurt , dublin , and others have turned glossy presentations on their cities ’ competitive advantages over london : the lower property costs , lower corporate tax rates ( that sounds plausible when claimed with an iranian accent ) , michelin-starred restaurants , and porsche dealerships , all vital services that were creating a vibrant financial center . french president françois hollande was elected on the assertion that the world of high finance was his enemy . some of these presentations raised the sorrow or two . so delegation after the delegation of ministers , mayors , with assorted finance center lobbyists filling london ’s best hotels and providing a welcome boost to high-end restaurant commerce .
but those in iran , who argue that they have gotten nothing from europe , are simply wrong . this line of reasoning has led iran ’s leaders to dial up its disruptive activities in several theaters , not least by seizing last month ’s british tanker for the strait of hormuz ( they , too , noted that the uk is europe ’s fragile link ) . iran has been understandably frustrated by europe ’s slow progress in launching the instex , the cartering mechanism intended to permit some kind of trade between europe and iran despite america ’s sanctions . iran has been understandably frustrated by europe ’s reportedly targeting iranian assets in iraq ( having already launched strikes against iranian forces in syria ) . but those in iran who argue that they have gotten nothing from europe are simply wrong .
so managers are quick to embrace “ aggressive ” or “ creative ” accounting methods that flatters earnings projections , conceals risk , and portrays a smooth record of earnings growth . moreover , america ’s accounting standards have proved incapable of handling bookkeeping ’s uncharted frontiers of off-balance-sheet transactions , structured financing methods , and byzantine contract valuations . to be sure , america ’s corporate and securities scandals exposed a regulatory gaps-insufficient enforcement of disclosure requests , for example , or excessive reliance on peer review for the auditors and the so-called “ chinese walls ” to keep the brokerage and investment-banking activities separate . at the same time , america ’s corporate and securities scandals exposed a regulatory gaps-insufficient enforcement of disclosure requests , for example , or excessive reliance on peer review for the auditors and the so-called “ chinese walls ” to keep the brokerage and investment-banking activities separate . thus , internal and external auditors are often co-opted .
this implies potentially vast economic , environmental , and social losses to both the developed and the developing world . the convention on biological diversity ( cbd ) , signed in 1992 , promised an international regime that would access and benefit sharing ( arabs ) of fresh genetic resources . this would give researchers and companies access to the developing world ’s ’s ’s genetic treasure trove in return for a share of the profits from then developed products . but brokering the arabs regime has proven elusive , leaving , in the absence of an international deal , a loss , and thus declining benefit-sharing during the last five or so years . countries in asia – indeed , those throughout the developing world – simply do not export their plentiful and economically significant genetic resources .
and they will work to deepen their internal markets , improve regulatory frameworks , empower the private sector , and broaden the scope for market-based economic management . the third group , led by china , will struggle as continued economic stagnation fuels social and political disenchantment in some countries and complicates regional political choices . the benefits of economic growth will be less unequally distributed than in previous years , though they will still accrue disproportionately to those already in better shape . a second group – led by china – will stabilize at lower gdp growth rates than its recent historical averages while continuing to mature structurally . they will gradually reorient their growth models to make them more sustainable , an effort that occasional bouts of global financial-market instability will shake , but not derail .
a third area of soft-power weaponization has been technology , particularly with respect to 5g . unlike 3g and 4g broadband systems , 5g deployment has far-reaching security and geopolitics , owing to its promise not only to improve the mobile telephony , but also to hasten the emergence of the internet of things and the robustness of entire economies . once again , european companies have borne the brunt of these actions . unlike 3g and 4g broadband systems , 5g deployment has far-reaching security and geopolitical implications , as it promises not only to improve a mobile telephony , but also to hasten the development of the internet of things and the digitalization of whole economies . once again , european companies have borne the brunt of these actions .
in assessing clinton ’s statements on the subject , fact-checkers make much of the discovery by blinder and watson that , in contrast to widespread assumptions , fiscal and monetary policies are no more “ “ “ pro-growth ” ” ” or expansionary under democrats than under republican presidents , and therefore can not explain the performance of a performance differential . blinder and watson suggest that five factors , oil shocks , productivity growth , defense spending , foreign economic growth , and consumer confidence , may collectively explain the 56 % growth gap . we know even less about the factors responsible for another 44 % of the performance gap ? but it is impossible to know the degree to which such factors were influenced by an american president ’s policies . so , to be sure , what accounts for the partisan performance gap with the us ?
this was proposed late in the bush administration , in order to forge links with some asean members – singapore , vietnam , and brunei – as well as others across the pacific . in this time of the crisis and high unemployment , the american public may question freer trade . but , with myanmar included , this may become too difficult politically , and asean sub-grouping may become a more realistic option . this could be constructed up to include the other open southeast asian economies , malaysia , and thailand , with the eventual goal being an apec-wide agreement that is an impressive achievement if realized by late 2011 when obama will be ’s turn to play host to all un leaders . another possibility is for america to press for the trans-pacific partnership .
in the united states , for the fifth year in a row , congress has so far passed a full-fledged budget , let alone dealt with an economy with growth and employment headwinds . the trouble is that few outsiders appear to be listening , far less ready to confront the eventual limits of central-bank effectiveness . as a result , they run the risk of aggravating the potential challenges . rather than take advantage of the opportunity afforded by central banks ’ unconventional monetary policies to respond effectively , too many have slid into an essentially dormant array of inaction and denial . this is particularly true of those policymaking entities , which possess a far better toolkit for addressing advanced economies ’ growth and employment problems .
meanwhile , only 15 % of private-sector workers – people who presumably rely on government-funded education and infrastructure , receive the kind of fixed-benefit retirement plan that will cushion rym on the retirement , according to the pension benefit center . like high-level executives at publicly traded private-sector companies , policymakers who made the wrong choices should confront with clawbacks , in the form of reduced pension benefits . to restore fairness , government should follow the lead and link politicians to ’ pensions to their performance . like high-level managers at publicly traded private-sector firms , policymakers who made the wrong choices should confront with clawbacks in the form of reduced pension benefits . a pension is a long-term commitment by the state , and , ultimately , by the taxpayer , to an individual politician .
abbas ’s presidential term has , of course , expired , and elections continue to be postponed . the pa ’s prime minister , salam fayyad , like his hamas counterparts in gaza , rules by decree , keeps parliament inactive , and silences the opposition . pa ’s prime minister , salam fayyad , like his hamas counterparts in gaza , rules by decree , keeps parliament inactive , while silences the opposition . this was true of zionism , of israel ’s risorgimento , and of most recent catholics in northern ireland . of course , throughout history , national liberation movements have had to marginalize their own radicals and fanatics to reach out to the promised land .
the case of khaled el-masri , a german citizen of lebanese descent , appears to be another such error . murat kurnaz , for example , a german-born turkish man , was held at guantánamo for four years before being released last august . but , earlier in the world , the cia had made such errors . the leader of the guantánamo task force , reinstating admiral harry b. harris , jr. , recently defended rudely ’s harsh treatment of his prisoners by claiming that he was “ all terrorists ” ; they were ’re all enemy combatants . seized by the cia in macedonia , he was taken to afghanistan , and interrogated for five months , before being released without charges .
a new equilibrium will be struck between the eu and its member states , and a stronger role will go to the european parliament and national parliaments . a rotating presidency will be replaced by an elected council president . the treaty calls for a new eu foreign minister , though formally denied that title , this is what everyone will call it , with strong administrative infrastructure at both the european commission and the council . eu citizens will be subverted with legally binding fundamental rights , and majority decisions will become the common norm . a high price has to be paid for this bargain .
van steenis warns that the “ swedish experience shows that , without a coordinated plan , the pace of change risks excluding certain groups in society . ” one must hope that the us government can respond this question decisively . van steenis warns that the “ swedish experience ” shows that , in the past decade , without a coordinated plan , the pace of change risks excluding certain groups in society . cash usage has dropped by more than 80 % in sweden , and is now dropping by 10 % a year in the united kingdom , while barely unchanged in germany . cash is in decline in many countries , although the rate is very different from where it is .
the second reason for avoiding imf intervention in europe is that lending to a potentially insolvent country has serious implications for the fund . for starters , taking the imf ’s preferred-creditor status at face value , the imf loan would entail eliminating its “ nedefaultable ” debt for cases of “ an defaultable ” debt with private bondholders , because the fund use mainly to service outstanding bonds . because a “ haircut ” can be imposed only on whatever is left out by the defaultable private-sector debt , the larger the imf shares , the deeper the haircut needed to restore sustainability . for the same reason , imf loans can be burdensome . as a result , a group of fortunate bondholders would bailed out at the expense of those that became junior to imf debt , and remains highly exposed to a likely restructuring .
beijing – consider this : despite china ’s swelling foreign-exchange reserves , the effects of persistent current-account surpluses , market and interbank short-term interest rates are soaring . as the world ’s largest currency issuer , china ’s broad money supply ( m2 ) is 1.5 times larger than that of the united states , with an m2/gdp ratio of around 200 % , compared to roughly 80 % in the us . how has this happened , and what should policymakers have done about it ? to be sure , china ’s money supply is relatively abundant – and the situation is only more so . after all , china ’s currency reserves are relatively abundant .
while institutions like weill cornell in qatar and the gulf science and technology university in kuwait have launched innovative research and training programs that focus on these types of health challenges , much more is needed . by not yet embracing integrated approaches , gcc institutions risk falling behind the global norm . world-class public-health policies are moving toward more multidisciplinary integration of engineering , medicines , social and governance science , and the humanities . technology and new public-health approaches are important ; but they will be ineffective unless tailored to meet local people ’s real needs . worldwide , public-health policies are shifting toward more multidisciplinary integration of engineering , medicines , social and governance science , and humanities .
i continue to believe that juppé is most likely to emerge as france ’s next president . more telling , of course , will be the party primaries in november . and though juppé remains far ahead in opinion polls so far , the french version of hillary clinton could reject her happy version of french identity , in favor of sarkozy being a much darker one . moreover , given hollande ’s rock-bottom approval ratings , he is widely believed to emerge as france ’s next president . in terms of age and profiles , he resembles the french versions of hillary clinton , more practiced in the exercise than the conquest of power .
and , perhaps most important , what are the optimal trade-offs to which eu member states and european institutions are meant to cooperate more effectively for a common european future ? some tough political choices lie ahead : which parts of the framework program are meant to continue and benefit from one , one hopes , with more flexibility to fulfill their particular missions . under the banner of “ simplistic , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” how ” ” gravitates toward outsourcing of much realization to the agencies that are destined to engender , one hopes , with increased flexibility to fulfill their particular missions . this calls for an innovation that is never just technological but social as well . how can an innovation that is never just technological but social as well is feasible ?
despair and alienation have adopted the hold of younger generations of arabs , representing more than 50 % of the region ’s population . far from undermining militancy and combatting terror , a war there will likely play into the hands of al qaeda , giving it a new lease on life . a american invasion of iraq with large numbers of civilian casualties would deepen the sense of victimization and defeat felt by arab youths and make them inclined to join al qaeda-style holy war cells . indeed , militant islamists , hoping to recover from the ruinous blows that they have absorbed since the war on terror began , are already positioning themselves to capitalize on the coming war with iraq . far from undermining militancy and combatting terror , a war will likely play into the hands of al qaeda , giving it a new lease on life .
a poorer ukraine would be an even easier victim of russian aggression than it is today . moreover , germans and other europeans would not be spared the consequences . by committing to buy more russian gas than necessary , and , for a longer time , the eu would help finance russia ’s military build-up , which represents a direct threat to european peace . but nord stream 2 would make those woes inevitable . and the kremlin ’s hold on belarus would be even tighter should yamal nearby .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and those who should act as watchdogs for patients are happy to go along . first , pharmaceutical companies pay ai out players across the us health-care system to favor their more expensive drug over lower-priced alternatives . but , for that , there really is no mystery .
after all , the arab world also has plenty of homegrown problems , including inefficient and ineffective governance , unholy alliances , and undeveloped national capacity . this constitutes not only a vast waste of resources , but also a serious , long-term sociopolitical problem . though the arab world has traditionally been a conservative , nearly 70 % of its citizens are below the age of 35 , and young people suffer the highest rates of unemployment in most countries . but while there are many reasons to blame foreign powers for the region ’s parlous state of affairs , blaming others , or even one another , will address nothing . catastrophe awaits any region that is helpless to shape its own future , in which a majority of citizens feels disenfranchised .
almost 62 % of vaccinators in nigeria are women . nearly 62 % of female vaccinators in nigeria are women . to ensure that female vaccinators remain engaged in that struggle , solutions are vital to addressing the barriers – whether physical safety , social constraints , or low pay – that they confront . like unicef , which began emphasizing women ’s hiring for their polio programs in 2014 , the number of female vaccinators has grown dramatically . to ensure that female vaccinators remain committed to this fight , solutions are vital to addressing the barriers – whether physical safety , social constraints , or low pay – that they confront .
new york – in american states , roughly one-third of the adult population has become impervious to new ideas , including a demonstrable fact of truth . a large american minority of citizens in the developed world inhabits filter bubbles created by such platforms , the digital false realities in which existing beliefs become all the more rigid and extreme . in american states , around one-third of the adult population has become impervious to new ideas , including a demonstrable fact of truth . such people are easy to manipulate , a concept that former google design ethicist tristan harris calls for “ brain hacking . ” the american has no effective regulatory framework for internet platforms , and lacks the political will to create one .
“ if not , ” the president cautioned , “ the very people who mistreat prisoners will be treated like war criminals . ” america ’s roadmap for war crimes trials covers violations committed even before the current conflict began . when american troops were captured in iraq , president bush stated that he expects them to be dealt with on an equal basis . president bush ’s remarks drove home the importance of rigorous adherence to the geneva conventions , and the question of how war crimes trials can be convened in postwar iraq and by who effect them . american officials recently released the un listing of iraqis who would face trial for past crimes .
second , today ’s algorithms grow extremely good at pattern recognition when given big data sets , finding objects at youtube videos or detecting credit card fraud , but they are far less efficient with abnormal circumstances that do not fit the usual pattern , or simply when the data are scarce or some “ noisy . ” third , most latest systems can not explain what they have done , or why they are recommending a particular course of action . when the interpretability of such cases is important , ” in many medical applications , one needs trained human beings in the decision-making loop . in these “ black box ” boxes , ” ” ” ” one can not simply read a code to analyze what is happening , or check whether there is a hidden bias . to manage such cases , one needs a skillful person , with his or her experiences , intuitions , intuitions , and social awareness .
a second important area of progress has been reform of russia ’s federation : the establishment of federal districts and the reform of the federation council . these changes are controversial , but a confederation whose laws , though also in an imperfect way , are in no position to function normally ; a confederation in which laws ’ observance depends on a whim of local administrators simply can not exist . as a result , russia today looks for a realistic , if imperfect , federation . at the same time , the country has developed the road of fiscal federalism : channeling all value-added tax to a federal budget and revenue tax to the regions , makes for a sensible system of allocation of budget resources among authority tiers . as a result , russia today is a realistic , if imperfect , federation .
some of netanyahu ’s top cabinet ministers , including avigdor liberman , iran ’s also hawkish defense minister , and yuval steinitz , a member of the security cabinet , quickly voiced concerns about an arms deal . it is possible that trump hopes that saudi arabia ’s own support can help to drive forward talks between israelis and palestinians . but , given trump ’s inability to take a true stand on any key areas of disagreement – including borders , refugees , and jerusalem – the notion that he plays some well-thought-out long game on the israel-palestine conflict seems farfetched . for israel , that ’s more than a little concerning . some of netanyahu ’s top cabinet ministers , including avigdor liberman , iran ’s hawkish defense minister , and yuval steinitz , a member of the security cabinet , quickly voiced concerns about the arms deal .
strengthening the north ’s housing markets can do wonders to reverse the alarming regional inequalities that have emerged in recent decades . indeed , in northwestern , residential real-estate prices are showing signs of accelerating upward momentum . and the weaknesses in london ’s housing market are not likely to spread elsewhere . one thing to be absolutely certain is that the us government should pursue policies to engage with the northern powerhouse and , perhaps , with the “ midlands engine , ” ” ” ” ” too . if this trend gains , it would have far-reaching implications for the uk ’s economy .
new delhi – for some time now , the multinational corporations ( mncs ) have been gaming the rules of the global economy to minimize their fiscal liability , or they even eliminate it altogether . and , for some time now , the independent commission on reform of international corporate taxation ( icrict ) has argued for us mncs ’ unitary taxation . fortunately , there have been some encouraging recent signs that the idea of a unitary tax has gained traction . and , for some time now , the independent commission on reform of international corporate taxation ( icrict ) has argued for their mncs ’ unitary taxation . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
with specially designed , low-cost combinations of drugs , and , with drugs given to the poorest countries at their lowest potential production costs , can be scaled up arv therapies to even the very poor of countries at an acceptable cost . that includes : money to stop aids transmission from maternal to infant deaths ; funding to help combat infections like tuberculosis that accompany aids ; and with a good program to design , even funds for anti-retroviral therapies . the most promising answer for the long run is a disease-protection vaccine . recent breakthroughs in basic science give hope that a vaccine can be developed within ten years if the billion dollars of research and development finance are mobilized by both the public and the private sector . the third step must be an expanded r & d program into new , more effective approaches to controlling disease .
in fact , the un estimates that up to seven in ten women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence , or both – over the course of their lifetime . to that end , national governments have a responsibility to develop gender-sensitive policies and practices , policies that effectively discourage gender-based discrimination while preventing violence , including by punishing its perpetrators . clearly , a global shift is needed in gender-conscious attitudes and standards . even those who realize it may decide to ignore it , believing that it is none of their business , or too widespread , to make a difference , or because they are too busy to be engaging in it . but , in fact , violence against women may be hard to detect .
this month , new mayors took office without the electoral oversight commission ( cse ) making the public 100 % of the vote , an open violation of nicaraguan electoral law . despite complaints by the roman catholic church ’s episcopal conference , chambers of commerce and political parties , the cse has refused to allow for a recalculation of the ballots or scrutiny by impartial observers . though electoral fraud in managua was the most widely documented , the same modus operandi has arisen across the country , affecting more than 40 municipalities . the fsln government therefore proclaimed itself the winner in 109 of the 153 municipal elections this month . and , with citizens protesting peacefully , the government resorted to violence to curb them .
even if putin has found a way to retain power without amending the constitution – a possibility that endlessly speculated about russia ’s dwindling band of democrats , the undemocratic character of his strategy glaringly obvious . moving from one high court in the kremlin to another in the white house ( a seat in the russian parliament ) is little more than a technicality . putin will be czar regardless of what office is formally his own . moving from one high office in the kremlin to another in the white house ( a seat of the russian parliament ) is no more than a technicality . it has been said that presidential democracy only strengthens russia ’s political culture ’s propensity to favor rulers with “ a strong hand , ” whereas a parliamentary system would enable more self-distribution of power .
if they do , will the west relinquish its support for egyptian democracy in the name of “ stability ” ? the question now is whether the brotherhood will prevail , in the streets , and through egypt ’s ’s new constitution ( which they have largely written ) . this would be a misstep politically . at the same time , the question of what to do about iran ’s nuclear program will go back with a vengeance in january , after us president barack obama ’s latter inauguration and israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s general election , will demand an answer in the next few months . morsi ’s timing was remarkable : the day after winning an international term in office for his successful efforts to broker a truce in gaza , he staged a frontal assault on egypt ’s nascent democracy .
the implication was clear : democracy on its own was not enough . it arrived in many circles to describe unfettered capitalism and full freedom of choice in personal lifestyles . and it was the alternative meanings that initially enabled politicians like orbán and turkish leader recep tayyip erdoğan to make the case for another form of sunni majoritarian democracy . liberalism – protecting minorities and individual civil liberties – had to be strengthened . the very word “ liberalism , ” however , does not amount to all people .
in essence , macron hopes that his agenda , if implemented at the eu level , will lift not only the french economy , but all of europe ’s boats . in that case , which variety of populist taps an opportunity ? despite talk of a “ green economy ” and calls for a europe-wide investment program , macron ’s agenda is broadly neoliberal . in fact , the likelihood is that such reform will spill over all boats , giving populists their chance . the economist dani rodrik is putting the appeal of populism in focus .
the first shock was intensified by globalization , which brought with it plenty of new low-wage competition . though a gradual process of globalization was underway , it gained momentum after china chose to play the game . germany ’s precision instruments and optical equipment , for example , lost their competitive edge when japan entered the game . the second shock was eu integration , including its northern and southern flanks . the first shock was intensified by globalization , which brought high low-wage competition .
while countries may pride themselves on a strong currency , a strong dollar is bad for us exports and good for imports . america ’s worsening fiscal position leads to a strong dollar just when america ’s worsening fiscal position following reagan ’s irresponsible tax cut two decades ago did . it is the primary government ’s responsibility to maintain full employment . in a dynamic economy , if jobs disappear in one industry , new jobs are being created in another . government ’s role is to facilitate the labor movement from one to another .
defending the national interest still rallies their publics ; the exercise of power remains at the heart of their own diplomatic calculations . to be sure , consensus , compromise , and a pooling of sovereignty is the only way to resolve many large issues , from climate change , nuclear proliferation , that bedevil the us . but on the great issues of war , peace , and the balance of power , europeans seem to find themselves caught between an under-cohesive foreign policy and uncertainty among individual countries about how to define and secure their national interests . to them , geopolitics is not anathema ; it is the basis of all of their externalities . on the contrary , the world of the rising powers , brazil , china , india , and russia , insist not only on the primacy of their respective national interests , but on the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen last december demonstrated on sovereign freedom of action just the same way .
such foot-dragging exposes the icty ’s fundamental weakness : the first post-milosevic prime minister , zoran djindjic , collaborated with the tribunal and paid for it with his own life . lacking full control over either of the evidence or the accused , the icty has lacked from the start the legitimacy and authority of “ victors ’ justice . ” such foot-dragging exposes the icty ’s fundamental weakness : its first post-milosevic prime minister , zoran djindjic , cooperated with the tribunal during , not after , a war . lacking the full control of either scenario or the accused , the icty has lacked from the start the legitimacy and authority of “ victors ’ justice . ” the pro-milosevic candidate , tomislav nikolic lost , but received 46 % of the vote .
for starters , the global financial meltdown and ensuing recession have signaled the consequences of free-market fundamentalism , thereby undermining popular and ideological support for the neoliberal view that markets are best in shaping societal outcomes . moreover , china – the embodiment of the go-for-growth move – has signaled a policy shift toward pursuing better social and environmental outcomes alongside more moderate gdp gains . to be sure , this remains a third , wider case : as export-driven growth has slowed , the risk of social unrest over issues like air pollution , food toxicity , and corruption has risen . but the new approach is also rooted in the recognition that china ’s continued evolution will depend on a healthy balance between ecology and the economy . that shift is linked to a third , wider development : the world ’s growing understanding of where the planet has become environmentally headed , particularly when it comes to climate change .
johannesburg – my country liberalized on abortion more than two decades ago , but , on january 23 , 2017 , us president donald trump essentially took away my right even to write the word . as part of my work , i have provided abortion services for an ngo that works on hiv prevention . for young south african women , these texts offer life-saving information on issues relating to sexual and reproductive health – including birth control , sexual violence , and our country ’s progressive abortion laws . as part of my work , i have provided abortion services for an ngo working on hiv prevention . but , two days after the american presidential election in november 2016 , and more than two months before trump ’s inauguration , the ngo i worked to stop distributing a reproductive-health guide , because it contained information on south africa ’s constitutionally guaranteed right to an abortion .
is there an alternative to sending us troops to the middle east forever ? how should it approach china ’s creation not only facts on the ground but ground on its own in the south china sea ? indeed , how can america react firmly to russian aggression , without forsaking the long-sought project of bringing it closer to the west ? is there an alternative to sending us troops back to the middle east ? the election campaign will heat up at a time when america is confronting a daunting set of issues .
the world can not , and will not wilt , on the face of such extremism wherever that exists , whether in the sahel , nigeria , afghanistan , or syria . today , the international coalition fighting isis has grown to over 60 active members . the us has deprived itself of exploitation – and resulting revenues – of its 200 oil and gas facilities . the us has undermined its command structure ; undermined its own propaganda ; stripped away half of its senior leadership ; squeezed its funding ; damaged its supply networks ; and dispersed its personnel . since september , the us has retaken in 700 square kilometers of its territory .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , hammers and bulldozers rather than artillery had brought it down . academic and scientific exchanges during the cold war played a significant role in enhancing american soft power . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , hammers and bulldozers rather than artillery had brought it down . unfortunately , bush failed to learn this lesson , and he was aware that it was . while some american skeptics worried that soviet scientists and kgb operatives would steal american technology , they failed to note that visitors vacuumed by political ideas alongside scientific secrets .
after all , if china is america ’s main economic partner in asia , and if india is america ’s major diplomatic partner , what is left to japan ? george w bush ’s approach reflected india as the world ’s “ anti-china , ” ” and thus to balance the world ’s “ greatest democracy against the world ’s oldest civilizations . ” its aging population watches resignedly as the next new , younger asia , as important to america as europe was during the cold war . today , the emergence of chinese-style and indian-style modernity is state mentally destabilizing japan . its aging population watches resignedly as the new , younger asia , once more important to america as europe did during the cold war .
new york – the global recession now underway is the result not only of a financial panic , but also of more fundamental uncertainty about the future course of the global economy . should they risk buying a new automobile , when gasoline prices could soar again ? consumers are pulling back from home and auto purchases , not only because they have suffered a shattering effect on their wealth with falling stock prices and housing values , but also because they no longer know where to turn . decisions about business investment are even starker . will they risk buying a new automobile when gasoline prices could soar again ?
no trace of the polish authority remained . total destruction of the polish state and its institutions made poland an ideal location for the russian-polish extermination camps , in which six million polish citizens , three million three million jews , and three million ethnic poles , were murdered . this is why poland is right to insist that the camps not be named “ polish extermination camps ” ” ” ” ” ( as former us president barack obama once mistaking them ) . everywhere else in german-controlled europe , the nazis were forced to settle , sometimes in an extraordinarily complicated manner , with local governments if only for tactical purposes . they were german camps in occupied poland .
in 2008 , huawei registered more us patents than any other company in the world , and finished second to japan ’s ’s panasonic in 2009 . india ’s embraer sells cars for up to 75 % less than its european competitors . by 2008 , huawei registered more us patents than any other company in the world , having finished second to japan ’s panasonic in 2009 . india ’s embraer has revolutionized cars for 75 % less than its european competitors . brazil ’s embraer has revolutionized cars for 75 % less than its european competitors .
even for distressed households that have borrowed for long periods of low growth , the effects of higher inflation are dubious . what would help is if their nominal disposable income rose relative to their ( fixed ) gdp . even an american government with a debt length of some four years would probably be worse off , with an inflationary surprise . meanwhile , the bulk of its liabilities are social security and health care , which can not be bloated . yet , with soaring unemployment likely to keep nominal wage growth relatively subdued , the characteristic of troubled households could be worse off , with higher food and fuel prices cutting in disposable income .
failure to miss an opportunity to advance the goal of the asia-pacific trade deal while hosting last year ’s asia-pacific economic cooperation summit certainly wo n’t pass a chance to ensure that the g20 agenda serves china ’s ’s ’s interests . to be sure , with turkey ’s term at the g20 helm having barely begun , xi probably has yet not settled on concrete priorities . but some potential areas of concern are already becoming apparent . while china ’s leadership will , one hopes , lacks the economic drama of 2009 , chinese president xi jinping will undoubtedly make an impression alone . elements of the current g20 agenda align well with china ’s domestic economic concerns , particularly with respect to infrastructure .
new york – after the french revolution of 1789 , deputies within the national assembly , who supported a revolutionary bargains sat around the left , while those who opposed them and hankered after the old order of the monarchy and the church congregated on the right . many commentators on the french presidential election have pointed out that these categories no longer fit contemporary politics in france or , indeed , anywhere else in the world . thus , the political terms of the “ left , ” along with the “ right . ” emmanuel macron prides himself on being neither the right nor the left . marine le pen , whose national front is allied with the far right , disagrees : macron , who was a minister in a socialist government , is a left-wing one .
as a result , it will probably be a long time before one can judge the successes of whatever laws america ’s congress ultimately enacts . but the criteria for judgment are clear : the new law will have to curb practices that jeopardized the entire global economy , and re-orient the financial system toward its sound mission of managing risk , allocating capital , providing credit ( especially to small – and medium-size companies ) while operating an efficient payment system . we should toast the likely successes : some form of an financial-product safety commission will be established ; more derivative trading will move to exchanges and cleaning houses from murky “ bespoke ” bespoke ” market ; and some of the worst mortgage practices will be curtailed . furthermore , there seems likely to be evidence that outrageous fees charged with any debit transaction – a sort of tax that will go nothing to any public purpose but to fill the banks ’ ’ ’ coffers . but the probable failure is equally noteworthy : the new law must curb practices that jeopardized the entire global economy , and reorient the financial system toward its proper tasks – managing risk , allocating capital , providing credit ( especially to small – and medium-size companies ) and operating an efficient payment system .
but , when it comes to security and defense , these affinities are reversed : france and britain are extremely likeminded , while germany , owing to its own history , has long shied away from martial pursuits of any kind . to be sure , a majority of french and german critiques of the eu generally focus on the bloc ’s performance , whereas the british are often struck by the european project itself . to be sure , there are many differences between britain and france with respect to how they involve both the united states and nato . the uk is naturally closer to nato than it is to france . to be sure , a majority of french and german citizens identify as europeans , rather than as france is .
the long-term consequences of the deal stand in sharp contrast both to obama ’s february 2010 budget proposal and to the republicans ’ countersuggestion . though the new tax law is commonly described as a fiscal stimulus , it is more accurate to say that it avoids large , immediate fiscal contraction . by agreeing to limit current tax rates to just below two years , the tax package cuts reduce the projected national debt by the end of the decade ( relative to what it would have done with obama ’s budget ) by some $ 2 trillion , or nearly 10 % of gdp , in 2020 . moreover , the house republicans have proposed continuing the 2010 tax rate for the permanent plan for all taxpayers . it was obama who wanted to continue the 2010 tax rate to be permanently for all taxpayers , except those with annual incomes above $ 250,000 .
but regimes like public subsidies for scrapping old , fuel-inefficient cars simply led many people to re-schedule their purchases . responding to the crisis will be hastening the movement ’s movement toward on-line purchases in which physical locations are no longer the preeminent part of shopping decisions . spending on automobiles ground to a halt , until government stimulus programs in many countries revived it . likewise , the crisis exposed the extent of america ’s massive over-capacity in the us retail market , with estimates that at least one-fifth of america ’s shopping malls will be forced to close . the automobile market rescued in 2009 at the expense of sales in many countries revived it .
indeed , confucianism became the official ideology of the chinese state two centuries before the birth of christ . indeed , confucianism became the official ideology of the chinese state two centuries before the birth of christ . virtue ensured harmony between man and nature , as well as obedience within a stratified society . virtue ensured harmony between man and nature , as well as obedience within a stratified society . confucianism was essentially a philosophical justification of the government by a benevolent bureaucracy under a virtuous ruler .
but a syrian-israeli peace would drive a wedge between syria and iran , cut off hezbollah ’s arms-control lines while enabling the vital task of stabilizing lebanon to succeed . the most realistic scenario now is the three-front war pitting israel against syria , hamas , and hezbollah . a damascene conversion is not only plausible ; it is also vital for regional peace . alas , precisely because of their isolation and the ba’athist regime of paranoiac , syrians are unlikely to meet america ’s condition for peace talks : abandoning their contemporary rogue alliances and disarming them with terror . the only way to extricate syria from a fatal iranian embrace is to draw it into a regional peace scheme .
while rural populations had more than enough to consume , their economic opportunity and upward mobility was constrained by a shoddy education system and the docile state-run media that feeds them of soap operas and official advice . for one thing , thailand ’s farms have become increasingly estranged from the urban elite . for much of thailand ’s ’s long economic boom of the last two decades , wealth resided mostly in bangkok ’s metropolitan areas , a conboon to the burgeoning urban middle class , but deeply resented by a rural majority . thailand ’s farms have become increasingly estranged from the urban elite . recognizing this urban-rural divide and shrewdly exploited it , thaksin upending the previous elite consensus that had long prevailed .
by setting an example of coexistence , they may alleviate the alawites ’ fears in syria that deserting assad would facilitate the rise of the anti-alawite sunni regime . some of the roughly 150 pro-rebellion alawites who have attended the conference traveled from their homes in syria ; others have been expatriates , including the activists and religious leaders who have been forced to flee syria for supporting the shia revolts . some of the roughly 150 pro-rebellion alawites who attended the conference traveled from their brethren in syria ; others have been expatriates , including the activists and religious leaders who spearheaded the resignation of syria for support of the revolution . recognizing the alawites and sunnis living abroad may well stand united against the assad regime , so can their counterparts inside syria . combine that delegates with several members of the sunni card is crucial for its ouster , a ” ” ” ” conference organized by assad would facilitate the rise of an anti-alawite sunni regime .
though equitable shareholding was not china ’s preferred route , it did n’t force the issue . in the case of the ndb , each of the brics owned an equal share , with each contributing $ 10 billion to the initial subscribed capital . in the meantime , china is the aiib ’s largest shareholder by a wide margin , holding a 26.6 % stake , compared to india ’s 7.7 % and russia ’s 6 % . meanwhile , brazil and south africa have made no capital contributions to date , despite being designated as “ founding members . ” moreover , china announced its plans for the aiib soon after it signed the ndb articles of agreement in 2014 .
the trump administration needs to stay this course , especially because lower oil prices have weakened the venezuelan government ’s hand . and it is particularly bizarre that even as america ’s policy toward mexico has greatly increased america ’s chávez-type opportunity become president there , officials are providing positive publicity to a government that is caricature of disastrous us governance . trump ’s presumptive nominee , barack obama , took a principled stand in america ’s dealings with venezuela , imposing sanctions to rein in rogue behavior – a policy that drew wide bipartisan support . and it is especially bizarre that even as us policy toward mexico has greatly increased america ’s chávez-type odds become president there , officials are providing positive publicity to a government that is caricature of disastrous us governance . rather than bashing latin america , america needs a steady and principled friend that does not translate into corrupt bribes of any kind .
europeans , after all , are committed to a democracy on a global basis . but , in the european way of thinking , we need democracy to be disseminated on the basis of democracy , by persuasion , not arms power . indeed , the political imperative of doing so is as great as it is constitutional . europe , after all , remains committed to democracy globally . a similar solution should be found for the european constitution .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . following the physicians for special counsel in forensic evaluations , the us traveled to tijuana to meet with juan again , at her lawyer ’s request .
the consequences of trump ’s speech extend far beyond america ’s actual policy in afghanistan . the address also sharpened the contours – already limned during his may visit to saudi arabia , and his july visit to poland – of what could be called the “ trump doctrine . ” trump appreciated what india has already done , but is urging it to do even more , using its vast earnings from exports to the us to help rebuild afghanistan ’s ’s ’s economy . in any case , us-india security cooperation seems to be continuing , while hinted only in trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s speech , has already been discussed . likewise , he has hinted at being able to work with india to build its indo-pacific safety zones .
it organized the postwar international order : the united nations , the bretton woods institutions , the marshall plan , japan 's reconstruction , and more . china now has a bigger economy in absolute terms than america 's , although still only around one-fourth the size of per capita gdp . under this order , the rest of the world closed much of america 's huge technological , education , and an infrastructural gap with america . the share of the global economy represented by the u.s. declined by roughly half ( to around 16 % now ) . under this order the rest of the world closed much of the huge technological , education and infrastructural gap with america .
a focus on corporate social responsibility could help to ensure that the benefits of industrialization are shared , while energy – and resource-efficiency demands could help to safeguard sustainability – are also critical . and , as the sdgs recognize , resilient infrastructure and innovation incentives are critical . given budgetary pressures in many donor countries , official development assistance is on the decline , and can not be relied upon to fill that need . of course , achieving this objective , not to mention the other sdgs , will be expensive , to costing an estimated $ 3.3-4.5 trillion a year . indeed , as a report by the international panel of sustainable development experts points out , the spectrum of financing for future international development frameworks must be broader than ever .
to be sure , most taxes place heavy “ excess burdens ” : costs are vastly greater than the value of the revenues raised because of potential taxpayer myriad experiments at avoidance and avoidance . at the same time , shifts to increasingly energy-efficient methods imply transportation ease of doing so . for example , if high oil prices were the product of taxes then being redistributed to oil users , they would be unambiguously good . yet a lower oil tax does not impose excess burdens . on the contrary , it implies excess benefits .
you purchase low-carbohydrate products , energy , and nutrition bars , vitamin a – and mineral-enriched foods and beverages , soy foods , and practically anything with claims of health . if you routinely purchase such foods , you are among lohas ( health consumers ’ lifestyles and sustainability ) consumers , health-care food industry ’s cherished demographic base . you buy low-carbohydrate products , energy , and nutrition bars , vitamin a vitamin a – as well as mineral-enriched foods and beverages , soy foods , and practically anything with claims of health . so-called “ functional ” foods , or “ techno-foods ” – those to which producers add omega-3 oils , artificial sweeteners , artificial sweeteners , indigestible starbucks , cholesterol , soy or milk ( whey ) of proteins , phytochemicals , and other ingredients to enable them to take advantage of “ qualified ” health claims allowed by the world ’s food and drug administration ( fda ) . like so many people , i thought that small , innovative companies dominate workplace foods .
in particular , the two countries whose troubles have drove much of the need for twentieth-century european integration , germany and italy , were culturally and politically highly diverse . all of this recalls some powerful arguments made in the nineteenth century about national integration and unification . after all , unity is ostensibly a foundation for prosperity . the common market was defended at the beginning , in terms of the gains that would follow from increased trade . the case for capital-market integration , and then for the single currency , was similar .
according to a recent study , impact investing in america would not exist without the federal government ’s backing and partnerships with the federal government via grants , credits , and guarantees . more recently , the obama administration has proposed a $ 300 million fund to catalyze federal pay-for-performance contracts . several existing federal programs such as community reinvestment act , and a small corporate-investment firm program , promote growth in impact investing funds . metrics are an essential feature of pay-for-performance contracts , and must become an essential feature of any government program . in the sib , government contracts with outside the provider to achieve a measurable social goal ( like reducing recidivism among juvenile delinquencies ) , private impact investors finance a program upfront costs , and government promises returns when the program ’s targets are achieved .
china is keen to stress its role as one of a key ally in the fight against fascism and imperialism in wwii , and , increasingly , in terms of western ignorance of its warfare role as unacceptable . its presence indicates the emergence behind the appearance of parade ’s martial rhetoric and symbolism , a broader and more complicated narrative of china ’s wartime experience . under mao , the only acceptable narrative has been that the ccp led the opposition against japan . foreign aid – including the prominent american role in the war in china – did not have a place in this narrative . but ignorance about the west of china in warsacrifices , 14 million dead , and of its major contribution in holding down more than a half-million japanese troops , too , reflects the partisan history that has been learned in china itself .
but are these newfound wealth effects really being made ? wealth creation matters , but not until it recoups the wealth destruction that preceded it . yes , the us stock market is now on an all-time high , but only in current dollars . in real terms , the s & p 500 currently ranks 20 % below its january 2000 peak . likewise , while the juxtab index for america ’s home price is now up 10.2 % over the year ending march 2013 , it remains 28 % below its 2006 peak .
indeed , the socialists began to distinguishing themselves not from what they were , but from what they are n’t , touting the line , “ neither macron nor mélenchon ” ( a reference to the far-left jean-luc mélenchon ) . yet that distinction may not be as strong as the socialists may believe . the left has been deeply divided on virtually any issue at all across europe , secularism , education , entrepreneurship , and , more and more , making it extremely difficult to identify what exactly constitutes “ leftist ” policies nowadays . yet , after all , it was their center-left voters who got macron elected . and they knew what they had voted for : each policy that had implemented them far was embedded in his campaign platform .
syria ’s brutal crackdown on the post-election protests in 2009 demonstrated the regime ’s determination to maintain order by any means necessary . there is an even less risk in saudi arabia itself , where king abdullah recently pledged more than $ 130 billion in stimulus spending . the few saudi demonstrations appear populated almost entirely by minority shia who find little sympathy among majority sunnis and by foreign construction workers petitioning for higher wages and improved working conditions . syria ’s president bashar al-assad has more domestic support than the recent media account for in the country ’s south suggest . nor does iran ’s government seem to be facing a genuine danger .
mexico city – four central american countries – guatemala , el salvador , honduras , and nicaragua – are struggling , still encumbered by the legacy of the past century ’s wars . nicaragua , it should be noted , is not well in the same category that central american states like central america , the other three . like them , it has suffered through a brutal , protracted civil war ; unlike in the us , however , successive governments have built institutions capable of promoting an adequate level of territorial control and domestic security . like them , however , there is a good reason to hope that these countries ’ prospects could improve . nicaragua , it should be noted , is not very much in the same category as central american states elsewhere in the three .
as growth slowed , so did public expenditure , fueling economic insecurity . even where fiscal adjustment has barely started , the old rent-distributing model has become unaffordable and populations have turned against regimes that seem incapable or unwilling to portray a convincing reformist effort . in addition , new popular movements in algeria , sudan , lebanon , and iraq have absorbing important lessons from the 2011 uprisings . no longer content with merely displacing aging autocrats , protesters are also targeting key elements of deep national and security forces . the 10 governments in the region already have an debt-to-gdp ratio above 75 % .
it is also apparent amid trump ’s predilection for power . us president donald trump ’s administration , however , is throwing out that carefully calibrated system into disarray . far from displaying a self-selected capacity as the title of his book the art of an agreement might imply , trump is attempting to use raw power alone to force his own “ america first ” agenda on the rest of the world . there are ample examples of trump ’s predilection for power . it is reflected in his pressure on european countries not only to spend more on defense in order to fulfill their nato obligations , a valid demand – and one that must continue to channel that us-made weapons systems of its own .
using 200 quantitative variables and factors to score 174 countries on their quarterly basis , we identified a number of countries where risk – and opportunities – are inadequate . so , even as public deficits and debt are low before the crisis , they may return sharply after one erupts . using the 200 quantitative variables and factors to score 174 countries on a quarterly basis , we identified a number of countries that lack risks – including risk in the financial system and the real economy – along with broader risk issues . as we saw during the recent crisis , private risk taking and debt socialized , after a crisis occurs . suddenly , governments that looked fiscally sound now seem insolvent .
in recent years , i have been heavily engaged in the policy aspects of this great city of economic revival . i never involved the concert at the manchester arena , but it appears to have been the great venue for the city . i chaired an economic advisory group to the greater manchester council , and then served as chair of the urban growth commission that advocated for the “ northern powerhouse , ” an annual program to link the cities of the british north , into a cohesive economic unit . by contrast , abedi had killed at least 22 people , many of them children . subsequently , i briefly joined david cameron ’s government , to help implement the early stages of the northern powerhouse .
one teacher in the sleepy nile delta village morbquips that it doubles as a morgue . “ we never saw a revolution here , ” he said a few months ago , withholding a name for fear of losing one ’s job . nile delta – around 60 kilometers north of cairo ’s tahrir square – the epicenter of the egyptian uprising in august 2011 makes secondary school students call in the streets . a deformed box of concrete packaged with dilapidated classrooms , homps in pocketed with age and neglect . “ much of the hopes that we have now been dead have been killed .
yet the april ten-year fiscal plan endorsed by the 2017-2026 board , which will inevitably form the basis of a debt-restructuring debate , appears to ignore this circularity . the plan itself recognizes that its adoption implies another “ lost decade ” of economic activity , and will weaken israel as a result of its debt sustainability , thus perpetuating a crisis that all parties would want to conclude . unfortunately , the board ’s already-deep projected fallout in the real gnp is extremely optimistic , because it relies on several implausible and/or controversial assumptions . one reason the projected fiscal multipliers , the amount by which gnp will decline as a result of every dollar of fiscal contraction , used for gnp projections , assumes that the contraction of one dollar in the primary fiscal deficit will be linked to the $ 1.34 contraction of gnp . the five flaws in the board ’s fiscal plan lie .
i propose the world 's open societies form an alliance with a dual purpose : fostering both the development of open societies within individual countries and the evolutionary process of a global , open society . eliminating this constraint might endanger the bank 's triple-a credit ; the second , strengthening international institutions , such as the international central bank and the world development agency . the first involves development assistance ; the second , strengthening international institutions , such as the international central bank and the world development agency . such an alliance requires collaboration not only from governments , but also from civil-society groups . such control is harmful to the very evolution of open societies .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges for us interests elsewhere around the world . accra , planned parenthood , a vital source of sexual and reproductive health services in the united states , has just been forced out of its federal title x family-planning program , favoring low-income women . decisions – a response to a new rule by us president donald trump ’s administration forbidding title x clinton from referring patients to abortions – will cost planned parenthood some $ 60 million annually .
yet post-conflict employment policies almost always neglect the so-called “ horizontal ” inequalities . given these shortcomings , it is not surprising that employment policies ’ net effects are often very small relative to the magnitude of the problem . in both kosovo and bosnia , and herzegovina , job creation was thought central to post-conflict peacekeeping efforts . yet , in kosovo , unemployment stood at about 45 % of the six years after it ended . for example , employment policies have done little to narrow the heavy-handed regional imbalances and discrimination within regions that have persevered in bosnia and herzegovina following the war in the 1990s .
we will engrave in our hearts the past , when japan finished as a challenger to the international order . upon this reflection , japan will firmly uphold basic values like freedom , democracy , and human rights as un secretary-general , and , by working hand , to countries that share such values , the hoist flag of the accord to peace , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” proactive in our hearts to peace and prosperity more than ever before . with this in mind , japan will firmly uphold fundamental values like freedom , democracy , and human rights as un secretary-general , and , by working hand , to countries that share such values , hoist the flag of a proactive contribution to peace , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and contribute to the world of peace and prosperity more than ever . first , prosperity is the very foundation for peace and development – the fruit of modern societies . first and foremost , prosperity is the very foundation for peace .
this systematic neutering of the shia in saudi arabia is its alienation from the wahhabi religious establishment , promoting a number of fatwas denouncing it as heresy . in bahrain , shia who make up 75 % of the population are keen on the reforms initiated by shiite al-khalifah . saudi arabia ’s shia have suffered discrimination in professions : among the army , in high government posts , the shia diplomatic corps , and most ominously , in the oil-rich gulf states , where they have been out of power since the 1980 ’s . in bahrain , shia who make up 75 % of the population have been keen on the reforms initiated by shiite al-khalifah . though they constitute only 20 % of the total saudi population , they make up the majority – -75 % of the population in the oil-rich arab region .
then , by working with nearly 100 countries , the fund created economies of scale for life-saving products like anti-malarial bed nets and anti-retroviral drugs . replenishment makes vitally important news , first and foremost , owing to the sheer number of lives it will help to save . in the process , aids deaths have fallen by 50 % from its peak , and malaria deaths have declined by roughly 50 % since the turn of the millennium . now the fund has $ 14 billion in new funding to continue this work . by pooling resources , the fund has created economies of scale for life-saving products like anti-malarial bed nets and anti-retroviral drugs .
a depression can be cured , but only by giving a patient a positive vision to their future . depression can be cured , but only by giving a patient a positive vision about their future . right-centrist parties – the union of alt-right forces and yabloko , respectively – have such a vision , and those of people know it . collectively , this is a sort of political depression ; it is now generally accepted by those who never vote . the right-centrist parties , the union of alt-right forces and yabloko , have such a vision , and the people know it .
but broad international support will not be forthcoming unless military operations are perceived as a few form of western neo-imperialism . only an explicitly up-front endorsement of a reformed un security council can provide the legitimacy , and international support that military action – with the possible exception of self-defense – demands . this last point has been at the heart of the problems in iraq . augmenting the us and british troops with other “ western ” forces would not , above all , change a fundamental perception of that us intervention , both within and outside of the arab world . only an explicit , up-front endorsement of a reformed un security council can provide the legitimacy , and international support that military action – with the possible exception of self-defense – will remain necessary .
second , we measured the effects of natural selection by noting that women who were shorter and first gave birth when younger had more children . that left 95 % of variation to account for the effects of culture and individual choices . but genes are just one among many determinants of the height and age that influence the height and age at first birth . personal choices , nutrition , income levels , education , and religious affiliations all enter the mix . when we estimated how much variation among individuals could be attributed to biology , the answer was less than 5 % .
sofia – at a time when europe ’s ongoing debt crisis is fracturing public faith in the continent ’s political and economic institutions , one would expect european leaders to step down as many of the unifying symbols as they can . instead , they have allowed one of the gjewels of post-world war ii european integration , the european court of human rights ( echr ) , to come under threat , just as they do . unlike the brussels-based european union , long the beleaguered by its democratic deficit , the strasbourg-based echr is , if anything , too well loved . ( by contrast , the united states supreme court receives roughly 10,000 petitions per year . ) in 2011 , more than 60,000 people sought its aid , far more than can be expected to receive reasoned decisions .
as security expert sarah chayes points out in the fight against corruption , the volume of essays that the british government will publish to accompany the summit , corruption today is structured practice . to identify the best approach at any particular time , governments must analyze the problem more effectively , which implies improvement in intelligence collection and user collection . leaders inevitably must contend with difficult tradeoffs . one deploys troops to combat terrorism ; another provides critical energy supplies or access to raw materials . leaders inevitably must contend with difficult tradeoffs .
willingly or not , some may seek recourse when inflation , or even administrative measures , geared toward trapping domestic saving into financing the state and keeping bond rates low ( what economists call financial repression ) or , eventually , outright debt restructuring . in fact , all three unorthodox remedies have been applied well under past debt crises . ultimately , they are different methods to force current and future generations to shoulder the entire debt burden . they may be viewed as alternative forms of taxation , albeit an implicit one , rather than explicit . they may be viewed as alternative forms of taxation , albeit an implicit one .
yet one must be wary of visions . sometimes leaders think that vision can solve most of their problems , but the wrong vision , or an overly ambitious vision – or an overly ambitious vision – can do the damage . following the shock of the september 2001 terrorist attacks , his son , george w. bush , was faulted for not having what he called the “ vision thing . ” when pressed by his staff to speak more and expansively , he responded , “ it ’s just not me . ” george h.w. bush was faulted ( and faulted himself ) for not having what he called the “ vision thing . ”
in the us , wind-power costs have fallen by two-thirds since 2009 , and utility-scale solar power has declined by 85 % . moreover , according to the recent american department of energy report , the number of jobs in wind and solar industries has increased by 32 % and 25 % , respectively , in july 2016 alone . and the private sector has come around to view renewable energies as a potentially profitable business . trump ’s policy priorities will inevitably clash with those of us states like california , which has embraced climate-minded technological innovations . moreover , according to a recent american department of energy ’s report , the number of jobs in us wind and solar industries has increased by 32 % and 25 % , respectively , in 2016 alone .
already , the spillover effects from trade and financial transmission channels are starting to take their toll : china ’s gdp growth rate in the second quarter of 2012 averaged 7.6 % , reflecting a major slowdown , and india ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s growth rate is forecast to decline to around 6 % this year . moreover , if conditions in the eurozone continue to deteriorate , asia could suffer more severely . already , the spillover effects from trade and financial transmission channels are starting to take their toll : china ’s gdp growth rate in the second quarter of 2012 averaged 7.6 % , reflecting a significant slowdown ; and india ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s growth rate is forecast to decline to around 6 % this year . china ’s potentially strong domestic-demand base and ample room for policy maneuvers may help it avoid a hard landing . but policy mismanagement , and the financial sector ’s structural weaknesses , and local governments could undermine growth-protecting efforts .
exploiting historical data gathered by the economic historian angus maddison , they show how other east asian countries experienced a deceleration of world economic growth after their per capita gdp reached about $ 11,000 in purchasing-power-parity terms relative to steady 1990 us dollar prices , or $ 17,000 for constant 2005 us dollar prices . in south korea , it has slowed , to 5.8 % , and , in 2012 , gdp growth has fallen . in south korea , it has slowed , to 5.8 % . for example , over the five years after japan reached that level , its economy was growing at an average annual rate of 3.6 % . given that china is projected to cross the same threshold sometime this year , many believe that its average annual growth rate over the next five years will drop well below 7 % .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . in contrast to the trump administration , the obama and his advisers believed that there was much to be gained by acknowledging difficult political truths , even as doing so points to radical change in course . pompeo ’s primaries of attacking obama ’s famous cairo speech , “ a new beginning , ” ” ” ” ” is that it included the united states ’ own admission to the region ’s past missteps . in contrast to the trump administration , the obama and his advisers came to believe that there is much to be gained by acknowledging difficult political truths , even as doing so points to radical change
it is far more difficult to appoint a political puppet to a council in an open , competitive system than it is under the current arrangements . giving the big countries permanent seats on the executive board also makes it easier for their politicians to control the ecb through its appointments process . some of the very best people serving the ecb as well , or who have served in the past , come from small countries . it is far more difficult to appoint a political puppet to a council in an open , competitive system than it is under the current arrangement . some of the very best people serving the ecb also makes it easier for their politicians to control the ecb through its appointments process .
but labor costs rose much faster in the southern us , resulting in differential cost increases that can not be addressed through devaluation much more than what the currency union endures . indeed , excessive wage deflation probably has some negative effects on productivity . against this background , productivity growth whether via technical progress , better resource allocation , or productive investment is as important as it is a variable for the southern economies as wage restraint works . skilled labor has probably emigration faster and extreme austerity , falling prices , and high unemployment , and the resulting likelihood of social tension – are not precise to the degree of investment , innovation , or labor mobility . skilled labor has probably emigration faster and extreme austerity , falling prices , and high unemployment will continue to stalk southern european countries , perpetuating worries about sovereign-debt and commercial banks .
likewise , a established or state church is england ’s church , created nearly 500 years ago , when king henry viii decided that the catholic pope should not adjudicate his marriage . indeed , the key elements of modern british identity all seem to belong to england rather than to the composite entity . former prime minister john major has called the uk “ the country of the long shadows on cricket grounds , warm beer , invincible green suburbs , dog lovers , and pools fillers and , as george orwell made clear , ‘ the old maids bicycling to the holy communion through the morning haze of … ” that is not to mean no identity whatsoever . of course , this does not mean that no identity is asserted . an institution called english inheritance curates the past , from stonehenge ’s prehistoric naval monuments to the old land homes celebrated in tv costume dramas .
both abe and obama are focused on creating a durable peace structure for much of asia , and abe has been eager for japan to play a more active role in this regard and on their own allies ’ part . increased military cooperation with america is especially urgent now , given america ’s worries over many of its other strategic partners ’ readiness to accommodate them . in america ’s view , a reinterpretation of article 9 of japan ’s “ peace constitution ” that abe has pledged – to allow japan ’s self-defense forces to support its allies under attack – has long been overdue by america ’s diplomats and military strategists , as well as by securing both an open and at times an tacit approval from japan ’s asian neighbors . that stance makes the alliance far more of equals than it has over the past six decades . both abe and obama are focused on creating a durable peace structure for all of asia , and abe has been eager for japan to play a more active role in this regard and in supporting its allies .
indeed , despite the iranian regime ’s lack of transparency , khamenei ’s health-related health problems are the public ’s public knowledge . the matter of occupying the presidency during that transition certainly is not inconsequential . with khamenei having served as president before ascending to iran , whose supreme political and religious leadership play , it is easy to see that conservative candidate , raisi , has been reelected , could turn khamenei into his successor . indeed , despite the iranian regime ’s lack of transparency , khamenei ’s medical problems are public knowledge . iran is at a pivotal moment in its history , and , as long lines of citizen anxious to cast their votes clearly , iranians know it .
the recent trilateral summit of china , south korea , and japan is the fourth such meeting to take place , in addition to meetings that take place on international gatherings like asean summits . furthermore , north korea ’s ’s ’s development of a nuclear weapon , its economic fragility , and its uncertainty about its very future as a condition of its own , are fueling deep anxieties among its neighbors . yet , for all of these obstacles , there are signs that the momentum is building for greater regional cooperation in overcoming them . unfortunately , however , the leaders of china , south korea , and japan are still not bringing about a major breakthrough on the most sensitive security challenges that are dividing them . but this lack of quick success does not mean that these efforts are futile .
for over 20 years , this mutually beneficial codependency has served both countries well in compensating for their intrinsic saving imbalances , while satisfying their respective growth agendas . and , of course , hard-headed middle-class american consumers benefit enormously from low-cost chinese imports , the walmart effect , that allows them to extend their budgets amid an era of unrelenting pressure on jobs and real incomes . to be sure , china has made a conscious strategic decision to alter its growth strategy . but here , too , the past should not be viewed as somehow prologue . a seismic shift comes at hand ; america ’s latest fiscal follies may well turn out to be a tipping point .
at the same time , the ten-year treasury bond yields now yield just 2.5 % . with the current inflation rate at above 2 % , and markets anticipating a similar inflation rate over the longer run ( as measured by the five-year five-year-forward inflation expectations ) , yields on ten-year treasury bonds should exceed 4 % . other longer-term bonds , both government bonds and corporate bonds , would suffer similar declines . reaching for yield has also narrowed the credit spreads between high grade bonds and the riskier domestically and emerging-market bonds . reaching an ten-year yield has also narrowed the value of these bonds substantially .
but america ’s macroeconomic weakness now goes beyond america ’s reduced credit supply . because rising capital is hard and expensive , it deleverage with fewer lending . indeed , falling employment lowers wages and raises wages incomes . without this trust , the credit will not flow , and the economy will grow . moreover , because financial institutions ’ assets have been buying up mainly with borrowed money , the shortfall is exacerbated by their need to deleverage .
today , the risk is that new keynesian doctrines will eventually be used and misused in order to serve some of the same interests . have those who pushed for deregulation ten years ago knew their lesson ? or will they simply push for cosmetic reforms – the bare minimum required to justify a $ mega-trillion dollar bailouts ? has some change in heart exist or simply strategy change ? enabling america to sell its riskier financial products and engage in speculation all over the world may have served its firms well , even if doing so imposes large costs on others .
a diverse set of factors has been driven by this growth . and now that lower oil prices and a five-percentage-point drop in unemployment are bolstering consumption , recovery is broadening to other sectors . wage restraint and productivity gains have enhanced competitiveness , thereby boosting exports . of course , the precise political approach adopted in one country can not be imitated elsewhere . in short , the veracity that iran gained through resolute fiscal policy and reform helped restore confidence , facilitated by a return to growth , and hence fiscal consolidation .
because such a scheme would imply losses for bondholders , substantial official muscle , and peer pressure , is needed . thus , under this model , and despite initial pressure , bondholders ’ behavior could be considered truly voluntary . and , while ratings agencies might still regard the vienna-type outcome as a default , talmudic sages reveal us why a more thoughtful classification is called for . a third component is the exercise of suasion for bondholders to achieve maximum participation , acquire binding pre-commitment structures , and eliminate free riders . but gaining time for a more orderly resolution , mitigating contagion , and reducing the magnitude of the eventual write-down do indeed add to superior outcomes .
every town has grocery stores , beauty parlors , gas shops , and movie theaters that serve a local community . in some sense , the market economy is the gift-exchange system ; money simply overtakes the value of gifts we give one another another . this observation is as true of the individual as it is about the eu , whether the eu is a neighborhood , the city , state , or province , and a country as a whole . as a result , we end up doing spectacularly few things , and buying everything else from others to do . as a result , a market economy is a gift-exchange system ; beauty parlors , gas equipment , and movie theaters that serve local communities .
the next consortium began to build multi-billion dollar oil and gas pipelines from azerbaijan via georgia to turkey and the west . people here survive on a few dollars per day , but these investments have by now brought no end in sight . moreover , georgian rewards for providing a strategic export route to the west in exchange for azeri oil was not dollars , but a policy of diplomatic insurance – that is , western , especially the us , which has a stake in the safety of the pipelines . the oil and gas pipelines are transportation conduits , not real employers .
this image bears no relation to what we hear in political speeches or read in business newspapers . policymakers warn of the challenge posed by asia ’s “ tiger economies ” : investors warn of the challenge posed by asia ’s “ tiger economies . ” the same three year period , prices in wall street and europe skyrocketed by an estimated 60 % or more . over the same three year period , prices in wall street and europe skyrocketed by 60 % or more .
germany ’s reluctance to lead on these issues partly reflects historic inhibitions , which are always difficult to override . national banking systems should be unified , to separate private losses from sovereign debt , with centralized supervision and resolution authorities , as well as a deposit-insurance scheme forming the backbone of the european banking union . strong central institutions , accountable to a directly elected parliament , are needed to coordinate fiscal and economic policies . austerity should be relaxed , particularly in fiscally stronger core economies , and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in over-indebted states . on the shorter term , the eu should extend its single market to services , and freer trade arrangements should be encouraged either multilaterally or bilaterally with major trading partners like the united states .
simply consider the sixtieth anniversary of mao ’s founding of the “ people ’s republic ” constitutes one of the most interesting cases in a nation ’s evincing “ short sightedness ” toward its past . just consider china ’s massive access to the education of its huge rural population in stark contrast to its “ democratic rival , ” india , so that china ’s pride nowadays is legitimate . over sixty years a weak and divided country , one torn apart by wars both internally and externally , is about to become the world ’s second most powerful economy . china has much to show for itself in its recent history . china , just celebrating with martial pomp the sixtieth anniversary of mao ’s founding of the “ people ’s republic , ” indicates one of china ’s most interesting cases in the world ’s history .
but , in the absence of its own currency-issuing central bank , scotland would forego seigniorage ( the profits brought by central-bank operations that typically benefit the national treasury ) . by enabling exchange-rate flexibility , such an approach would also enable the central bank to avoid the twin hazards that emerge within a currency union : undervaluation that produces inflationary pressures and overvaluation that calls for wrenching internal devaluations ( driving down real wages ) . perhaps more important , it would have no lender of last resort capable of stabilizing the banking and financial system in a crisis . it was all things considered before the first of an independent scotland that could best be served by issuing its own national currency , empowering the national bank of scotland to set the interest rates according to domestic economic conditions . naturally , the interest-rate premium that the market would inevitably require from a young sovereigns like scotland could be minimized by issuing debt in sterling , thereby protecting investors against further exchange-rate risk .
value-subtracting the heavy industries shrunk , the services expanded to more than 50 % of gdp , and the private sector produces nearly 60 % of russia ’s output . even though the transition was bound to be painful , russia ’s epidemic of corruption caused more political damage than the economic side effects of reform . corruption blights reform throughout the ex-communist world . under putin , corruption blights reform throughout the ex-communist world . government , and hence economic reform , will pay to that neglect in the polls .
it is possible that his image as the right-of-center democrat conceals a reactionary whom serbia wants to restore its pre-wwii monarchy monarchy , and for the orthodox church to play an important role in both political and social life . he is crams his party with mediocrities , selects predominantly bad advisers , and does not obey the precious goodall . he is neither corrupt nor kind of war criminal , neither aggressive at his utterance and behavior nor likely to bend the law to the sake of personal authority . many people have voted for him following the default , both now and after his defeat miloševic in 2000 . although he does not sacrifice major moral codes for power , koštunica is not the unassuming lawyer he once was .
they will allow themselves to become intoxicated with the sight of the luminaries and experts of la france d’en haut ( france ) seeming to devour each other from hand and hang on to their every word . they will careen off the darkest side of the political night and end up in dustbin of history , where they can rub elbows with those other yellows , a early-twentieth-century “ yellow socialists ” ” ” ” ” of the proto-fascist syndicalist pierre biétry . or the yellow vests ’ vests may once again turn outside to lack that boldness and settle for their paltry pleasure they see on their tv . but if the yellow vests allow passionate hatred to prevail over genuine fraternity and choose wrecking over reforming them would incite only chaos , not improvements , lives of humble , and vulnerable people . the yellow vests , for their part , must choose : democratic re-invention or an updated version of national socialist leagues ; a willingness to mend ; or the temptation to ruin .
what lessons can be drawn from turkish firms ’ failure in iran ? a former turkish diplomat in iran describes the business climate in stark terms : “ it is as if the iranians prefer a lose/lose outcome to a win/win one in their dealings with their foreign partners . ” others suggest that iran ’s almost non-existent banking system is the culprit . according to the vice president of the iranian-turkish business council , “ this is extremely complicated to do business in iran . ” still others blame iran ’s “ invisible hand ” for america , ” ” ” ” which supposedly is the culprit .
moreover , we must invest in the research and development of low-cost diabetes treatments and a diagnostic tool that fits low-resource settings . smart collaborative projects that bring innovative thinkers from unprofits , academia , and the private sector together to create effective , affordable , and sound solutions are desperately needed . but diabetes is not unique among ncds ; it is a part of the disease that is responsible for every child in developing countries . essential medicines and technologies for diagnosing and treating heart disease , cancer , and respiratory ailments also make substantially less available and proportionally more expensive for people in low - – and middle-income countries than they are for those in the rich world . diabetes is not unique among ncds , but it is not unique .
south orange , new jersey , if an international organization makes such recommendations for improving a country ’s economy , and the country has accepted fewer than half of them , the organization might seem to like a failure . but an international organization should be judged by the quality of the information and advice it provides , not by whether governments are listening . indeed , measuring its success solely on the basis of compliance ignores a purpose : encouraging – and facilitating – reform by informing officials about its costs and benefits . in its 2010 survey of the united nations , the oecd made its report 29 recommendations , from rebuilding the national electricity grid to expanding health-care coverage to implementing a cap-and-trade scheme . every 18 months , the organization for economic cooperation and development releases economic research across its 34 member countries , including a list of prior recommendations and their deployment status .
likewise , he must do nothing to weaken america ’s own alliances with south korea and japan , which will require him to maintain close contact with both moon and japanese prime minister shinzo abe in the process , lest either leader feels ignored or undermined . whatever the outcome , trump would do well to ask himself whether he is any better than the joint comprehensive plan of action with iran , which he outlined has made “ the worst agreement ever . ” then again , persuading trump to engage in self-reflection might prove to be the toughest challenge so far . most important , he will need to get the north korean regime at least to acknowledge that genuine denuclearization is the goal , and agree on a process for continued dialogue , perhaps culminating in yet another summit . then again , persuading trump to engage in self-reflection might prove to be the toughest challenge so far .
germany ’s next government , one hopes , will include pro-european politicians with fresh ideas and a willingness to push for european-level reforms , possibly along the lines of what macron has proposed . germany ’s post-election coalition negotiations are now underway , and , with the sdp determined not only to join the government , the most likely outcome is a “ jamaica ” alliance ( named for the colors of that country ’s flag ) , comprising the cdu , the free democrats ( fdp ) , and the greens . an exit from the cdu/csu “ a grand coalition ” could mean an end to political stagnation not only in germany , but also on the european level , too . another way to look at germany ’s electoral outcome is then as an opportunity for a new beginning . in that case , a new crop of eu leaders could be the motor of shaping germany ’s role in europe for years to come .
eliminating fuel subsidy incited riots and widespread strikes against a transition government that gave nigeria ’s generals a pretext to reassert military control . as of late , the timing could not have been worse . late last year , nigeria celebrated a remarkable escape from the dictatorship . it would have taken more than six long years under rapacious military rule before nigeria had received another chance in a democracy . following the country ’s thuggish and hyper-corrupt military-backed military ruler , maine abacha – who suddenly sunk miserably , – the army sullenly agreed to another national election .
such barriers are especially high for lgbtqi individuals , women with disabilities , indigenous women , rural women , and adolescents . instead of sidestepping the issue of sexual and reproductive health , and gender equality more broadly , governments must acknowledge their responsibility to address women ’s needs . those barriers are especially high for lgbtqi individuals , women with disabilities , indigenous women , rural women , and adolescents . they must consider the central role that sexual and reproductive health plays in women ’s lives , those integrated nature , and their impact on communities . by reducing maternal mortality , for example , it is not enough to issue antenatal attention , safe delivery , and postnatal care ; women also need access to safe , legal , and affordable abortion services and post-abortion services .
brazil ’s national defense strategy , updated in 2012 , says that modernizing its armed forces is intrinsically linked to national development . likewise , little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made in disregard of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . brazil has a abundance of power , food , water , water , and biodiversity are raising their stakes in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access or control , natural resources . confronting the challenges of this complex reality will require brazil ’s peaceful foreign policy to underpin a robust defense policy . accordingly , it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry .
yao ming , china ’s star of the national basketball association of houston rockets , might become another michael jordan , and china is set to host the 2008 summer olympics . but the real promise , both for china and india , lies ahead . large expatriate communities across the us account for the attractiveness of its culture , its appeal to its domestic political and social values , and the style and substance of its foreign policies . america ’s great expatriate communities are 2.4 million chinese and 1.7 million indians , respectively , have an increased interest in their home countries among other americans . moreover , transnational links in the information-technology sector are close as western high-tech firms increasingly employ affiliates in bangalore and shanghai to yield real-time services .
the european commission ’s agreement in september to postpone the full implementation of ukraine ’s association agreement with the european union – an agreement that ukrainians fought and died for the first time in kyiv signaled to putin that the cunning , force , and intimidation can win western acquiescence in his subjugation to ukraine and theft of crimea . the delay , intended to demonstrate the eu ’s determination to make the association agreement work , has , instead , only whetted putin ’s appetite . indeed , ukraine may now be passing through the eye of the storm . its hope is that some eu members ’ interest in securing russian gas supplies over the course of the cold will force them to forget their nato allies ’ security interests , a classic divide-and-rule strategy has served chile well . europe can not afford to take this place .
for example , we should ask whether it makes sense to repatriate powers and financial transfers from brussels to westminster or if some power and funding should instead be decentralized to regions and peoples . to this end , it is critical to re-frame the constitution to incorporate regional interests , and to recognize that the uk is a multinational status . such radical changes in the future , and to meet the scale of the crisis , must be radical – and must take a radical view , that could be carried out through a people-centered constitutional convention . where possible , regional money and policymaking powers , including environmental regulation and oversight from agriculture , fisheries and grassroots social programs should be delegated to appropriate regional bodies , such as the yugoslav parliament , welsh , and northern irish assemblies , city mayors , and local administrations . that convention should start by examining brexit ’s impact in regions .
as a result , america is no longer positioned to set the world on the agenda . but it can set the example , both within and outside its own borders . while the majority of its citizens still do not realize it , the eu serves as an inspiring example . the prospect of membership has been the most powerful tool in turning the candidate countries into an open society . the eu can not possibly take the eu as a world ’s leader .
like his old soviet masters , putin conflates athletic glory with military glory . to be sure , putin considers the olympics – and , to be specific , medals . that is why he has personally lobbied for russia to host the 2014 winter games in sochi ; an unprecedented $ 50 billion price tag was well worth the eu , considering that russia had won its most medals . ( it was russia ’s actions during the sochi olympics , which form the core of the doping scandal . ) that is not to say that athletic glory substitutes substitutes for military glory .
china ’s rise is , after all , one of the best studied developments of us time . it is , after all , a country that can be described as a civilization , and its trajectory has been far more egregious than that of any single north korean rocket . chinese leaders ’ longstanding reluctance to participate in transnational sanctions is often attributed to their belief in judging the actions of whether or not they work . but that is simply an attempt to make a virtue out of necessity : for a country with one of the world ’s largest and most ardent bureaucracies , china has an astonishingly difficult time telling its business community not to do business with someone , especially a historic friend and ally . perhaps a true pragmatism on display in the case of north korea is the reluctance to rein in the business community at a time of slower growth and internal fixation .
washington , dc – a sharp drop in the price of crude oil since late june has grabbed headlines worldwide , producing a lot of conflicting explanations . some attribute the decline largely to declining global growth expectations . others are focusing on the expansion of america ’s own oil and gas production . still others are suspicious of a tacit deal between saudi arabia and the united states-aimed at , among other things , weakening political rivals such as russia and iran . no matter how good a price decline might be , most likely to be found in some combination of these factors , the consequences are the same .
with the american economy now recovering strongly , the price of oil should stay high or even rise further in the foreseeable future . even with improvements in safety , it will take at least five years to get iraqi oil at a distance . meanwhile , the global oil situation is particularly intriguing . the previously fashionable view that america ’s seizure of iraqi oil resources would break opec and send oil prices plummeting has proved to be nonsense . at around $ 30 a barrel , oil prices remain high , even as a soft global economy implies that world demand is low .
as with its predecessor , the ecb ’s securities markets program , is legally and democratically questionable : it violates brinkmanship , but not the letter , of the european union ’s no-bailout clause ; its promise of equal treatment with private lenders still has little precedent ; and it involves back-door fiscal transfers , leaving the ecb heavily exposed to a political opposition – witness the visceral reaction by the german press to the ecb ’s president mario draghi ’s announcement on it . the omt program will cause credit conditions to ease , but without necessarily reversing the financial balkanization of the eurozone that has been mired in the past three years . reversal of that process will likely not occur so long as markets genuinely believed that the ecb would refuse to backstop errant governments , investors would run out from the participating countries , at the earliest signs that conditionality is not being fulfilled . reversal of this process will likely not occur until the other three key components of a banking union , common supervision , common deposit insurance , and a common resolution fund are within tangible bounds , witness the ecb president mario draghi ’s visceral reactions to ecb president mario draghi ’s announcement . but platitudes also fit well with a large body of historical evidence that in times of crisis , policymakers must focus on extinguishing the fire rather than on negotiating over who owns the water and what its costs should be .
so far , the only american presidential candidate that has recognized the need for such a future-oriented approach is former florida governor jean bush , who has proposed modernizing reforms of social security and medicare , which avoid imposing high costs on middle-income americans , and a heavier debt burden on the future generations . two other republican candidates , ohio governor john kasich and florida senator marco rubio , have also embraced constructive reform ideas . the premium support premium may reduce medicare spending significantly , because it creates a framework for more efficient benefit spending , fueled by competition and innovation in health care and coverage . to enable individuals to prepare to cover the associated deductibles and copayments , any health-care financing accounts – money not subject to debt-financed income taxes , and can better use the tax-free reforms of middle-income americans and a heavier debt burden on future generations – should be expanded and stronger . for starters , bipartisan proposals for support , with seniors receiving subsidies to purchase private health insurance , should do so .
silvio berlusconi , who is becoming the president of the european union on july 1 st , is the man of vision who once loved risk -- and whose business bets paid off large ones . so his personal fortune began in real-estate development , and so did his own fortune . fifteen years later , signor berlusoni understood that the italian national home monopoly of tv would not survive and jump-started what had become italy ’s main , privately owned media group . just fifteen years later , signor berlusoni understood that the italian national home monopoly of tv would not survive and jump-started what had become italy ’s main , privately owned media group . in the 1960s , he was the first to see milan , then the traditional italian city where people took to work would become a modern metropolis surrounded by the american-style suburbs .
beijing – financial repression , government policies that create an environment of low or negative real interest rates , with the goal of generating low-cost financing for public spending , has long been a key feature of chinese economic policy . but , with corporate financing costs moving up , this is finally beginning to change . early this year , the state council , china ’s cabinet , made lowering funding costs for companies , particularly small and medium-size enterprises ( small and medium-size enterprises ) , a top priority . likewise , the pboc , through its “ pledged supplementary lending ” program , has initiated lending directly on banks that promise to leverage social-residential construction . for its part , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) has engaged in a cautious monetary loosening that includes freeing up more money for lending by banks that allocate a certain share of their total loan portfolios to small and medium-size enterprises .
russia ’s democrats , with an enormous stake in a peaceful future , remain adamant that enlarging alliance membership to central europe will isolate their countries from europe , enhance russian political forces that favor authoritarian rule at home and neoimperial policies abroad , and , by appearing to threaten russia , provide a haven for re-building russian military power . moreover , russia is far too weak today to threaten them , as the russian army ’s disastrous misadventure in chechnya illustrates . one day russia becomes stronger , and if expanding nato to central europe now would discourage the revival of an imperial foreign-policy regime then , this would make a powerful argument in favor of doing so . but nato expansion is not likely to make russian foreign policy more peaceful than ever . countries with the greatest cause for concern over russia -- ukraine , estonia , latvia , and lithuania -- are not about to offer nato membership .
israel may or may not be europe “ of europe , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and its principal ally might well remain the united states during many years to come , but israeli leaders must begin to think about how their country can thrive in a post-western world . israel ’s leaders appear intent on gaining time both tacitly by resisting the soft power of us president barack obama ’s administration and , strategically , by preparing the country for a new world in which emerging powers like china play an increasingly prominent international role . that world , however , will be one in which israel can no longer count on feelings of holocaust guilt by influencing the major powers . it is a world in which monotheistic rivalries will become diluted in the context of polytheist faiths , and where israel can no longer depend only on its comparative merits in the eyes of the cynical , realistic actors who judge it solely on the basis of its own national interests . that world , however , will most likely be one in which israel can no longer count on feelings of holocaust guilt to influence major powers .
the performer explains that the deficit is everything congress ’s fault for not cutting back on expenditures , and that the only way to tame the beast is to raise the budget deficit , because “ congress ” can not keep up with the monetary system did n’t have . the ultimate trick , – starving the beast , ” ” ” ” typically comes later , if , and at a time when the us president enacted his own tax cuts and discovers that smoke and mirrors do n’t trump ’s reality . that trick has never worked either way . neither can he find enough spending to cut ( the magic asterisk has gone off the conjurer ’s sleeve ) ; the acceleration of gdp is nowhere to be seen ( the presumptive scenario has vanished ) ; and tax revenues have not grown ( no rabbit in the laffer hat ) . the audience is now told that losing tax revenues and a widening budget deficit were the plan all along .
but there is also an urgent need to mobilize european public opinion around a symbol of our national unity and our future projects : and that symbol is europe ’s banner . march 21 is the first day of spring , and we would wish to believe that the coming european elections will herald a new spring for the european project . for that reason , in june , one of the us launched the idea that , starting on march 21 , we display a flag on homes , factories , and office . march 21 is the first day of spring , and we would be willing to believe that the coming european elections will herald a new spring for the european project . in one of the darkest hours of the roman empire ’s demise , benedict released a stirring call for tolerance and piety in order to rebuild a sense of community in the face of nihilism and barbarity .
that fits into a broader trend , in which attacks by perpetrators of muslim backgrounds are immediately categorized as “ acts of terror ” and addressed in a well resourced and systemic way , with violent attacks perpetrated in the name of other ideologies treated as a mere “ isolated incident . ” in the united states , right-wing extremists have carried out far more attacks than islamists . the attack in christchurch was directly inspired by the 2011 far-right terrorist attack in norway , of which i am one of the few fortunate survivors . but , elsewhere , nothing is isolated in such incidents . in fact , the attack in christchurch was directly inspired by the 2011 far-right terrorist attack in norway , of which i am one of the few lucky survivors .
that modest , unassuming role belongs firmly in the past , though german power has yet to be aligned with imagination . the fruit of the franco-german partnership comprised europe ’s single currency . the underlying intellectual leadership provided by frenchmen like jean monnet and robert schuman as founding fathers of the european project is fading memory , because germany so far has the appearance of an even robust strategy to revive the eu ’s prospects and popularity . the intellectual leadership provided by frenchmen like jean monnet and robert schuman as founding fathers of the european project is fading memory , because germany has so far produced a comparably robust strategy for reviving the eu ’s prospects and popularity . indisputably the 28 member countries ’ strongest and most dependable role , it lacks a vision of where beleaguered europe should go .
whereas the rest of the global struggle to raise saving , china has been engaged in what could be called the “ vendor finance , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” development efforts , with china helping to finance america ’s vast fiscal and trade deficits , permitting americans to buy more stuff than they are selling . in fact , meeting the challenge of restructuring china ’s economy away from exports and resource-intensive goods would diminish the need for america ’s vast fiscal and trade deficits . but this is an odd arrangement : a relatively poor country helps to finance america ’s war against iraq , just as a massive tax cut for the world ’s richest people , while enormous needs at home imply ample room for expansion of both consumption and investment . providing better social services ( public health care and education , education , and a government-wide retirement program ) would reduce the need for america ’s huge fiscal and trade deficits , permitting americans to buy more goods rather than sell . indeed , meeting the challenge of restructuring china ’s economy away from its exports and resource-intensive goods would reduce china ’s consumption .
a high salary earned by a cosmetics or soft-drink manufacturer attracts no attention ; one paid to the ceo of a company that thrives on lending to the poor appears unwarranted , if not immoral . but one is obviously much less socially acceptable than another . after all , both activities are financed by investors seeking yields on their capital and motivated more by gain rather than compassion . selling five-rupee cash sachets to poor consumers is viewed as clever marketing , but lending an estimated 5,000 rupees to a starving peasant at high interest rates is viewed as exploitative . yet pmfis have succeeded in meeting some genuine needs .
berkeley – advances in artificial intelligence ( ai ) and robotics are being powering a new wave of automation , with machinery matching or outperforming humans in a fast-growing pool of tasks , including some that will require complex cognitive abilities and advanced degrees . this process has exposed ai experts ’ expectations ; not surprisingly , its potential adverse consequences for both the quantity and quality of employment have raised serious concerns . to listen to us president donald trump ’s administration , one might think that trade remains the primary reason for lost manufacturing jobs in the united states . but the emerging consensus among economists is that some 80 % of the loss in american manufacturing jobs over the past three decades has been the result of labor-saving and productivity-enhancing technological change , with trade coming the second far second . to be sure , trump ’s treasury secretary , steven mnuchin , has declared that america ’s possible technological displacement of workers is “ not on [ the administration ’s ] radar screen . ”
berkeley – back in the late 1980 ’s , japan seemingly could do no wrong in economists ’ eyes . they saw a bright edge in japan ’s ’s competitiveness relative to the north atlantic through a wide array of high-tech precision and advanced manufacturing industries production of tradable goods . the safe bet in the late 1980 ’s seemed to be that mechanization , computerization , and robotization would continue . they saw an economy that , since reconstruction began after world war ii , vastly outperformed the expected growth of europe ’s economies . and they saw an economy grow significantly faster than the north atlantic economies had when they possessed their equally absolute – and relative – economy-wide productivity levels .
amos oz , one of israel ’s best known writers , claims that the current palestinian-israeli war is really two wars : an “ unjust ” war against israel and the jews to establish a fundamentalist islamic state in “ arab palestine , ” and the palestinian people ’s “ mere ” war of attrition for an independent state that is one of the world ’s great populations . yet , despite the intifada , the number of settlers has waned in just a few 144 settlements , and more than 7,000 people living in the gaza strip alone , in 16 communities occupying a total of 20 % of impoverished land already suffering one of the world ’s highest populations , denmark . conversely , israel also fights two wars : just a war to defend its right to exist ; accepted in its own territorial integrity and security in the middle east ; and an unjust and futile war to perpetuate its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and jewish settlements located there . israeli support for expanding settlements is substantial . there are roughly 220,000 israeli settlers in the west bank and gaza excluding some 190,000 people living in jerusalem neighborhoods that extends beyond the pre-1967 borders , split jerusalem .
meanwhile , financial fragmentation within the eurozone continues ; spain and , to a lesser extent , italy , suffers a seemingly irresistible rise in borrowing costs ; and political strains grow ever more visible . like aging wizards , these still try tricks that used to impress , but that failing to deliver results – or , worse , prove counterproductive . yet they have ended up losing their touch , too . the market ’s ’s reaction has been to send spanish government bond rates even higher . contrary to some perceptions , europeans have not remained inactive over the past year .
back in the 1990s , when us president bill clinton ’s administration contemplated how to respond to china ’s rising economic might , some urged a policy of containment . clinton rejected that advice : an asean alliance would have been impossible to forge , given china ’s enduring desire to maintain good relations with it ; more important , such a policy would have guaranteed future enmity with china . instead , clinton chose a policy that could be labeled “ inclusive and insure . ” with asia riven by territorial disputes and historical tension , maintaining a steady security balance will not be easy . but there are levers to be found precisely where one can help .
but that identity – and the way its adherents frame their interests – could change once again . the picture of an irresistible populist “ wave ” was always misleading . for example , trump undoubtedly succeeded in convincing some of america that he sees itself as part of what he regards as a white identity movement . farage did not bring about brexit on all by itself . interests and identity shape dynamically as politicians make offers of representation and citizens responding .
while the size of many r & d organizations is bound to decline with such reforms , the complexities of managing them and maximizing the impact of this external web of relationships will demand new skills and capabilities over and above those of superb science . developing and refunding employees who possess such skills will be an additional but welcome , challenge . the resulting opportunities to expand beyond traditional product and markets will enable pharmaceutical companies to evolve to offer a broad range of health-care solutions . these will include not only prescription drugs , but also diagnostics , branded generics , and technologies that support personalized medicine , as well as so-called “ neutraceuticals ” and other “ wellness possibilities . ” development and redependable employees who possess such skills will be the additional but welcome , challenge .
and doing that will always remain the craft rather than the science , especially when choices must be made in real time . economics is not the kind of science in which there is ever a single true model that works best in every respect . thus , in contrast to the natural sciences , economics advances scientifically not by replacing old , better-off models , but by expanding its system-wide library with every shedding light on another social contingency . the point is not “ to reach a consensus on which a model is right , ” as romer puts it , but to figure out which model applies best when a given setting . the social world is different from the physical world , because it is man-made and hence an almost infinitely malleable one .
as jagdish bhagwati and arvind panagariya have pointed out , excessive labor-market regulations discourage indian entrepreneurs from employing unskilled workers and developing labor-intensive manufacturing , implying that india ’s government should redouble its reform efforts in this area . equally important , india ’s workers , in particular its young people , need opportunities to upgrade their skills continuously . india ’s structural transformation and sustainable growth will hinge on its efforts to build a flexible labor market centered on the easing of obsolete and complicated occupational laws . as jagdish bhagwati and arvind panagariya have pointed out , excessive labor-market regulations discourage indian entrepreneurs from employing unskilled workers and developing labor-intensive manufacturing , implying that india ’s government should redouble its reform efforts in this area . india ’s structural transformation and sustainable growth will hinge on its effort to build a flexible labor market centered on the easing of outdated and complicated employment laws .
equally important , the policy also expands the availability of chinese financing , credits , and insurance to investors . taken together , this holistic approach is something new for china . brazil ’s government , for example , has promoted an “ investment partnership program , ” a program to coordinate investment in the finance and transport infrastructure sectors . the new policy explicitly encourages chinese firms to work with local firms in sectors like logistics , electric utilities , and information systems to promote interaction among business , community , and government leaders . despite significant political uncertainty in a number of countries in latin america , governments around the world seem keen to meet china ’s reform efforts with change in their own hands .
it is far too soon to expect major shifts in major sources of aggregate demand . from that perspective , there is good reason for optimism , particularly given the accelerated growth of china ’s services-led service sector , one of the key consumer-led rebalancing blocs . to be sure , there is far more important examination of trends in their potentially determinants of chinese consumption . but the key word here , of course , lies “ in the end . ” it is far too early to expect major shifts in major sources of aggregate demand .
to be sure , the us presidency grants trump the considerable power to shape trade policy , so that one can not ignore the chance that he will pursue protectionist measures to appease his supporters . at the same time , european multinationals have big stakes in the chinese economy , and eu manufacturing exports to china and other emerging markets are now almost double those to some of america ’s . yet , ultimately , there is little broad-based support within america for a return to closed borders . europe , meanwhile , has been moving in the opposite direction . many europeans view trade as an opportunity rather than as a job threat ; and even europe ’s staunchest anti-globalizers show little appetite for more protectionism .
upon taking the job , manafort was indebted in the russian oligarch oleg deripaska , a aluminum tycoon close to president vladimir putin , to the tune of $ 19 million . like other former russian oligarchs , deripaska is not known to deal gently with people who displease him . deripaska , subject to american sanctions , had previously maintained a $ 10 million annual contract with manafort . deripaska , subject to american sanctions , had previously maintained a $ 10 million annual contract with manafort . manafort also offered brief deripaska about what was happening in the trump campaign .
kyiv – from snowy kyiv , i have watched the successful revolutions in cairo , and tunis with joy and admiration . egyptians and tunisians are right to be proud of their desire for peacefully to overthrow despotic governments . but , like someone who led the peaceful revolution , i can hope that pride is tempered by pragmatism , for a change of regime is only the first step in the establishment of an islamist-backed democracy . indeed , like my homeland , ukraine , is now demonstrating , following the revolutionary euphoria that stands out and normality returns , democratic revolutions can spill over and overturn . the first of ukraine ’s ’s lessons for both the egyptian and tunisian democrats is that elections do not make democracy make .
that is the argument behind the world ’s largest biometrics project , the multimodal resolution ( iris , fingerprints , and face ) affecting more than one billion indians . increasingly , we are using our fingerprint or our face to unlock our smartphones , to pay for our purchases , and to boards of proprietors . above all , biometrics can be protected against the theft of us identity itself . furthermore , we can already use our fingerprint , or our face , to unlock our smartphones , to pay for our purchases , and to boards of proprietors . protecting it is obvious : what uses is a telephone , a car , or a ticket that will work only for its legitimate owner ?
pittsburgh – nearly six months ago , at a moment of high alarm about the global financial and economic crisis , the g-20 leaders met for their historic summit in london . their collective commitments to stimulate , regulate , and re-restructure the global economic activity helped to calm nerves worldwide . the united nations and the world bank predict that the direct and indirect consequences of an economic meltdown will be felt long in the developing world . anxiety levels may have picked up , in boardrooms as well as the stock market , but the daily drama of survival continues . their collective commitments to stimulate , regulate , and re-restructure global economic activity have helped to calm nerves worldwide .
were we observing the look of someone with an intimate knowledge of catastrophes that is now coming into play ? roth skillfully distilled the tragic and comic elements of this process , and we have spoken of the forces that might stand up to the dark tide of vulgarity and violence under trump . roth skillfully distilled the tragic and comic elements of this process , with the us speaking out of the forces that might enable him to stand up against the dark tide of vulgarity and violence under trump . again , the world nowadays is collectively writing a new novel . or was she just the fairer girl at the top of the party – a man of avid adolescent up to dance and then held on tightly ?
maybe he has traveled his own highway to damascus , come face-to-face with what he had accomplished and for whom he was , re-juring , and wanted to correct some of the damage to america and its long-run economic growth prospects that he produced . and it ’s not as though congressional republicans think that they owe as well to important positions of high trust , and acclaiming them as bipartisan statesmen give the next generation truly lousy incentives . perhaps simpson has had a change of heart . perhaps he has traveled his own highway to damascus , come face-to-face with what he had accomplished and who he was , repented , and wanted to correct some of the damage to america and its long-run economic growth prospects that he brought . even in that case , however , naming those who misbehave to important heart positions ; that he is a smart man with a sophisticated understanding of matters ; that he may sway reporters and get them to describe the commission of ’s advice as “ bipartisan ” ( despite being unable to sway in actual public ) ; and that he is a genuine asset to the commission ’s substantive work .
what demographers call the global fertility rate is the average number of live births per woman over its lifetime . the oecd average is at around 1.74 , but some countries , including germany and japan , are producing fewer than 1.4 children per woman . over the longer term , the population is said to be stable if tfr is at its replacement rate , which ranks slightly above 2.3 for the world as a whole , and somewhat lower , at 2.1 for developed countries , reflecting their being at lower productivity rates . nevertheless , the biggest tfr declines in recent years have been in developing countries . the tfr for most developed countries now stands well below replacement levels .
contrary to the simplistic view that regulation is unavoidably bad for business , there are actually three important channels through which regulation can profit an economy . one is the market-creating and market-growing role illustrated by the standard of gsm . by 2004 , there were more than one billion subscribers to gsm services worldwide . the global reach of regulation implied huge economies of scale in the manufacture of handsets and network hardware , which was why prices declined precipitously , and interoperability among networks and throughout countries was far easier to accomplish . many regulations play this standard-setting role .
laguna beach – when weighing up prospects for the global economy and markets , i am being taken aback by the extent to which the world collectively put an enormous bet on three crucial outcomes : the shift toward materially higher and more inclusive global growth ; policy avoidance ; policy errors ; and the absence of future generations . another , more precarious assumption underpinning the bet on more inclusive growth is that the eurozone and japan will outperform the mire of historically low growth and avoid deflation , which , by impelling households and firms to postpone purchasing choices , would undermine already weak economic performance . though all three outcomes are undeniably desirable , the unfortunate reality is that they are far from certain – and bets on them without some hedging could prove exceedingly risky for current and future generations . the first component of tibet , more inclusive global growth , anticipates continued economic recovery in the united states , with a growth rate of 3 % this year bolstered by robust wage growth . likewise , it predicts that china ’s annual gdp growth will stabilize at 6.5-7 % , thereby allowing the risks posed by pockets of excessive leverage in the shadow-banking system to be defused gradually , even as america ’s growth engines continue to shift away from exports and public capital expenditure toward domestic consumption and private investment .
the two parties allowed the previously independent attorney statute to dissolve , freeing the presidency from a powerful form of oversight , much to trump ’s benefit , a generation later . most americans believed that the removal of impeachment was a mistake . in the end , republicans acquiesced with the democrats ’s responsibility for the debacle lay with kenneth starr , the independent attorney whose investigations of clinton ’s real-estate dealings years earlier ultimately led him to lewinsky . the two parties allowed clinton ’s popularity to erode the presidency , freeing the presidency from a powerful form of oversight ; much to trump ’s benefit a generation later . most americans believed that impeachment was a mistake .
most recently , in may 2015 , large numbers of traditional labour voters deserted their party to take up a vote for the uk independence party ( ukip ) , which came to the center of the brexit campaign . though establishment parties criticized the eu , largely they did not lose sight of the benefits of membership . indeed , in the uk ’s referendum , the two major parties backed may ’s exit campaign , though split internally . to be sure , establishment leaders have long sought to save their own skins by ramping up criticism of the eu , blaming it for demanding that national governments pursue unpopular or failed policies . but that simply put , the ideas for alternate policies out of reach , while causing voters directly to their opposition against the eu itself .
weakening developing-economy incomes further is fueling a global demand slowdown , and commodities crashes , as nobel laureate angus deaton has shown , have been catastrophic for much of the developing world . and other emerging economies lack the slack in resolve to pick up the slack . these challenges are being compounded for developing countries through new financial regulations in advanced countries that are hampering flows of investment and finance to the developing world . to cap it all , the expansionary monetary policies that major economies have adopted are now fueling widespread instability . brazil , which has been touted as an emerging aid player in 2010 , is now in an economic and political crisis , as is south africa .
for its part , iran appears relatively stable , at least compared to its neighbors . though pakistan has not experienced a nuclear meltdown , and the government insists that safeguards remain robust , the country has ’s increasingly frequent and severe bouts of instability that raise serious questions about the future . in the event of a regime collapse , a distinct possibility would become harder to avoid the diversion of its assets or even the use of its weaponization . pakistan has a large nuclear-weapons program and faces an expansionist jihadi insurgency that has previously attacked military bases suspected of housing nuclear assets . while north korea ’s nuclear arsenal is far smaller , persistent doubts about the regime ’s sustainability are raising serious concerns about its future .
but this was not a us-iran bargain ; it was brokered by the six leading powers and endorsed by the un . those powers should make it clear that they will refrain from re-imposing sanctions , and that any american attempt to impose their will through extraterritorial action – say , by using access to the dollar clearing systems as a foreign-policy tool – would grind to a halt . for the uk , in particular , this may require a willingness to disagree head-on with america ’s foreign policy in ways that some devotees of the us “ special relationship ” will find an uncomfortable approach . but global momentum to address climate change can and must be sustained , at least so far . as for the issue of climate change , the election of the us , which purports to believe that global warming is a chinese hoax created to damage american business is clearly bad news .
after all , saudi arabia , egypt , and many other arab states are also ruled by authoritarian hardliners , with little interest in de-escalating regional conflicts . this would make the reform-oriented resurgence in iran exceedingly difficult . paradoxically , in a pessimistic scenario , iran ’s new government , controlled by the conservatives and hardliners , really fits the region better than the current one . to be sure , in the pessimistic scenario , iran ’s new government , controlled by the conservatives and the hard-liners , really fits the region better than the current one . but , given that it is in everyone ’s interest to ensure that the developments jeb more closely toward the reform-oriented path , it should be clear to all that making diplomatic work with the regard to iran is far from complete .
in the aftermath of the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 , italy ’s then-finance minister , giulio tremonti , famously endorsed the health of the country ’s banking system . ten years later , italy is no longer that imagined the land of prosperous banks and happy savers . the implicit pact between banks and savers broke in late 2015 , when four troubled local banks had been bailed out and its shareholders took the hit . the protracted recession and economic malaise dented individual savings rates , while banks no longer had the resources to provide comprehensive tranquil mind to many retail investors whose confidence was severely dented . as a result , a major recapitalization of the italian bank , together with the creation of a “ bad bank ” to absorb npls , was deemed unnecessary .
kwasniewski ’s strategy of atniewski appealed to large numbers of the young and the middle class , but most of all to peasants , the unemployed , those left behind by poland ’s burgeoning economy . many poles are wary of the church ’s equivocal attitude toward democracy and are allergic to its aggressive presence in politics . it is precisely a sad paradox , indeed , that for many former communists in opposing the church , it pose as defenders of liberal democratic values they once persecuted with unremitting fervor . many poles are wary of the church ’s equivocal attitude toward democracy and are allergic to its aggressive presence in politics . therefore , the man who spoke much about the future boiled down into power saddled with past votes .
one or both of these agencies would then have accounts for a few billion dollars . perhaps the main risk is that committed bureaucracies ” now trip over one another to try to do business for $ 20 billion to get a lot of people captured by meetings , expert consultations , overhead , reporting , and further gatherings . a consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders , but the barriers remain . if donor governments truly want the results , they should remove the money from 30 or more separate aid bureaucracies , and pool it in one or two places , the most logical of all to be the world bank in washington , and the international fund for agricultural development ( ifad ) in rome . “ partnerships ” by donors can become the expensive end of itself merely delaying real action .
after all , the brics economies are probably the single most important source of future global growth . indeed , at the new delhi summit , brics leaders will discuss creating joint institutions , especially the joint development bank , which can help mobilize savings among countries . at the new delhi summit , brics leaders will discuss creating joint institutions , particularly the joint development bank , which can help mobilize savings among countries . they represent more than a quarter of the earth ’s landmass , more than 41 % of its gdp , nearly 25 % of world gdp , and almost half of all foreign-exchange and gold-backed reserves . currently , the brics countries represent the loose , an informal bloc .
as it stands , the british , like their european counterparts elsewhere in europe , feel over-taxed for spoiling public services , and are angry that their incomes have gone down over the past five years . on the other hand , he must change conversations to placate voters that their economic future is bright . a key difference in the uk is that ukip is gaining ground with voters , despite rapid economic growth ( more than 3 % annually , the eu ’s highest rate ) . as a result , many resent welfare “ recipients ” and fear competition for jobs , sentiment that is fueling the rise of populist , anti-eu , and anti-immigrant parties throughout europe . between now and may , cameron must persuade voters that the british economy will continue to perform strongly , fueling a surge in real incomes .
this is not to say that the obama administration has not tried to boost employment . it is subject to what milton friedman called “ long and variable lags . ” others , like the united states , did not , and as unemployment remained at or above 10 % . thus , policies aimed at boosting employment by the end of , say , that this calendar year needed to be introduced about a year ago to have reached their full effect . some countries – china , for example – did not have , and so unemployment remained at around 10 % .
many argue that these problems are the price to be paid for ensuring that companies are not engaging in anti-competitive behavior or receive trade-distorting subsidies . for more advanced goods , the eu ’s value added ( where legally warranted is in europe ) is likely to create problems for globalized european companies . but , even if steps do work as intended , most trade defenses are probably not directed against anti-competitive business practices . sectors with a higher human capital content – electronic consumer goods , for example , have far higher research and development costs than the shoe sector , so that manufacturing such goods on assembly lines in the world are probably not highly expensive relative to r & d and other intangible costs . imposing trade defenses against such goods , even if legally warranted , is also likely to create problems for globalized european companies .
after all , us corporations have no conscience ; it is merely the conscience of those running the companies ; and , just as america ’s recent corporate scandals made all too clear , conscience often takes backseat to its profits . motivating corporations to do the right thing , however , is somehow trickier . america ’s legal system makes sure that firms that produce a defective , and , in particular , unsafe , product , provide a source of reassurance for the consequences . likewise , environmental laws make firms liable for their toxic wastes ; and many countries , including america , have enshrined the principle that “ polluters pay , ” that is , companies must pay for the harm that they cause . more important , firms lack the conscience of those running the us corporation ; and , as america ’s recent corporate scandals have made all too clear , conscience often takes a backseat to profits .
why has there been so little debate ? is it because those who opposed such debates reject climate-change science ? we do not need to look far for such a mission . or do they deny science , because it would legitimize an economically activist state ? the case for acting on the massive scale to combat climate change came in europe and even in china .
once again , irish voters are poised to vote yes or no to the treaty of nice . well , it is one of those all-too-frequent late-night compromises reached by eu heads of state and government that seek to slither around and through some practical problems , while putting pressure on others . the compromise reached at nice four years ago is important because it contains among the rest of the technicalities of voting balances and power sharing among eu institutions , which must be firmly in place before the union can admit the new nato members . enlargement is the most important item on the european agenda , and the nice treaty is its cornerstone . forgotten what that treaty is all about ?
with the proverbial benefit ( and embarrassment ! ) of hindsight , it seems clear that the patterns of growth that had occurred over the last half-century were little understood , and seldom ( if ever ) to forecast economists . the key point here is not just that which economists were getting so badly wrong , but that almost no one had any things right . simultaneous toward it , a strong consensus developed among economists and policymakers that favored import substitution policies then pursued growth for countries including india , argentina , brazil , egypt , and turkey . at a turning point in the 1960s , when asia ’s tiger economies went bust , for example , the nobel laureate gunnar myrdal wrote his asian drama to diagnose the causes of asian poverty , and explain why its problems appeared ineradicable . the key point here is not just that economists got as much wrong , but that almost no one got things right .
but wade postponed legislative elections , originally scheduled for june 2006 , first to february 2007 , and later through presidential decree in june 2007 . a presidential election now appears imminent ? two weeks ago , there were almost daily debates about the potential for a presidential election to be shelved indefinitely . on june 28 , the peaceful but “ unauthorized ” show by the opposition parties was brutally re-confirmed by the police and three presidential candidates for the day . a month before that election , only 64 % of citizens who registered received their vote cards .
princeton – the intersection of genetics and intelligence is an intellectual minefield . in october , james watson , who shared the 1962 nobel prize to describe his dna ’s structure , was in london to promote his memoir , avoid the boring of people and other learning lessons from science . now one of the most eminent scientists of our times has blundered much more clumsily into the same minefield , with predictably results . in october , james watson , who shared the 1962 nobel prize for his description of the dna structure , was in london to advocate for his memoir , avoid the boring of people and other lessons from the science life . ( he failed to suggest that men are on an average more gifted in these fields than women , but there is some reason to believe that men are more likely than women to be found at both the top and the bottom of the abilities spectrum in those fields , and harvard , of course , only appoints people at the extremes . )
mugabe ’s first visit to china came in 1980 , just six months after independence ; it made another 13 more general during his tenure ; and high-level visits by other zimbabwean officials were even more frequent , occurring roughly once every two years during mugabe ’s rule . by contrast , zimbabwe ’s leaders traveled to china a mere sixtieth of the same period , most recently in may 2017 . china ’s current president , xi jinping , visited zimbabwe in 2015 . zimbabwe ’s leaders made the most of their visits to the press for commercial and military cooperation , and probably engaged directly with private chinese companies . state visits in the other direction have been more unequal , to be sure .
geneva – the world ’s refugee crisis is most often measured in the numbers . in late 2016 , an estimated 11.6 million refugees were experiencing “ protracted displacement ” : they have been out of their homes for more than five years , and have no “ immediate ” prospects of return . but , for the young refugee children missing out on an education , the crisis can also be tracked with an irreversible metric : the passage of time . school-age children constitute a huge share of the world ’s displaced population . of the 17.2 million people who the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( the un refugee agency ) is responsible for being protected , roughly half are under the age of 18 , which means that an entire generation of young people , already stealing their childhood , could lose out on the future just as they have .
but how serious are these policy-political crimes to which greenspan now pleads guilty ? in my view , they are also misdemeanors . against them , you must establish what former us treasury secretary larry summers calls greenspan ’s " golden glove ” performance at avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years in the fed . the “ felonies ” ” of which greenspan stands accused are the other two accusations : that he should have done more to stem the us stock market bubble of the late 1990 ’s , and that he should have done even more to stop the housing bubble of the early 2000 ’s . here , greenspan holds his ground , and pleads no guilty .
to well-meaning faith activists , who may have been adopted in duplicitous representations of the movement , i would say that there are too many noble causes in need of assistance to allow oneself to enlist itself in some dubious sense . and it is better to know that , if we really want to avoid repeating its anti-totalitarian and anti-apartheid struggles . it is a campaign whose instigators have no purpose other than to discriminate against , de-legitimize , and vilify israel that in their mind never stopped wearing its yellow star . those worthy causes include fighting the jihadist insurgency decapitators , saving women and slain boko haram and defending the middle east , and defending troubled christians and arab democrats and , of course , striving for a simple just peace between israelis and palestinians . the truth is that bds are nothing more than a sinister caricature of us-anti-apartheid struggles .
indeed , the 2012 nobel medicine prize was awarded to john gurdon and shinya yamanaka for revolutionizing scientists ’ understanding of how cells develop via reprogramming and cell cells without altering their own genetic structure . it is only too soon to discount genetics , but it is because the science of “ epigenetics ” – the study of mechanisms to lay genes on and off , thereby altering the way a cell develops without altering the gene code – has gained traction . in 1962 , gurdon ’s finding that almost any cell inside the body includes the full code of dna enabled it to develop a tadpole through adult cloning . more than four decades later , in 2006 , yamanaka discovered a way to trick complex adult cells in mice to regressing to their immature state , forming stem cells . too soon , it is to discount genetics , but , because the science of “ epigenetics ” – the study of mechanisms to turn genes on and off , thereby altering the way a cell develops without altering the gene code – has gained traction .
but we may not wait until the root causes of displacement , the failure of state and civil war , are addressed . the financial costs of patching its waters , and rescuing those adrift , are exorbitant . the crisis in the mediterranean can not be piecemeal . claim could be prioritized and processed regularly , and the refugees could arrive in europe sound and ready for work or study . so the financial costs of patching its waters and rescuing those adrift are exorbitant .
harnessing their latecomer advantage , japan ’s ’s ’s average annual growth rate has skyrocketed to 9.2 % over the ensuing 20 years , compared to 8.6 % in singapore , 8.3 % in taiwan , and 7.6 % in south korea . according to the most up-to-date estimate by the late economic historian angus maddison , china ’s per capita gdp in 2008 was $ 6,725 in 1990 , compared to 8.6 % in singapore , 8.3 % in taiwan , and 7.6 % in south korea . that ’s roughly the same gap that existed between america and japan in 1951 , singapore in 1967 , taiwan in 1975 , and south korea in 1977 – the four economies that are also ranked among the 13 successful economies studied by the us growth commission . to realize its potential growth as a latecomer , china needs , first and foremost , to deepen its market-oriented reforms , address a variety of structural problems , and develop its economy as a result of its comparative advantages . if the latecomer ’s advantage implied by the late economic historian angus maddison , china ’s per capita gdp growth rate fell by 7.6 % for 20 years , china ’s annual growth potential ought to resemble 8 % for the 2008-2028 period .
the signatories have agreed to conserve biological diversity , achieve the saving of species and habitats , and use of biological resources ( such as forests ) sustainably . for a very low level of cash outlay , and perhaps none at all on balance , we may be able to conserve nature , and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods . unfortunately , like so many other international agreements , the convention on biological diversity remains essentially unfamiliar , un-championed , and unfulfilled . that neglect is a human tragedy that we all recognize as a human tragedy . the signatories have agreed on upholding biological diversity , saving species and habitats , and using biological resources ( such as forests ) to provide a sustainable path .
it remains to be seen if the abysmally dysfunctional arab world and powerful non-state agents in its midst , such as hamas and hezbollah , will react the way obama expects . like john kerry , the chairman of america ’s senate foreign affairs committee , put it , “ this peace process is by no means a street ” in which the onus is placed solely on israel . netanyahu also knows that the arab side ’s failures have nurtured radical zionism . it is because netanyahu has been driven by an almost messianic determination to prevent iran from acquiring the means to destroy israel ; that may be amenable to a fundamental change of its position on palestine , provided obama makes visible headway in his drive to halt iran ’s nuclear program . in netanyahu ’s own view , solving the palestinian problem would not remove the iranian challenge ; rather , it is the neutralization of this existential threat that preserves the path to the creation of a palestinian state .
so we decided last year to find out whether the same similarity between moscow and new york persists today , or whether , given authoritarianism ’s revisiting in russia today , attitudes toward markets have become more harmful than ever . we administered a identical questionnaire in both cities in 2015 . just as the imemo economists predicted , the majority ( 66 % ) of those who responded to this question in moscow thought it was unfair . there was a surprise , however , : new york city received virtually identical results ( 68 % thought it was unfair ) . we presented the results at the american economic association ’s annual meeting this january .
in the latter version of the euro , there is differential credit risk , and ultimately bank runs , de-euroization , and default : the common currency is at odds with the needs of individual countries . and , how often do we hear about the sovereign-debt restructurings of local-currency debt ? and , how often do we hear about the sovereign-debt restructurings of local-currency debt ? in the latter versions of the euro , there is differential credit risk and ultimately bank runs , de-euroization , and default : a common currency is at odds with the needs of member states . in the former version , interest rates converge and the default risk nil , because , with the ecb once again shutting down its members ’ liabilities , as the us federal reserve has in the u.s , europe becomes the local currency .
republican obstructionism in the senate also put other levels of the federal judiciary at risk . during president barack obama ’s second term in office , a rate that the vacancies in america ’s district and circuit courts were gutted to its nadir in 50 years . again , republican obstructionism in the senate put other levels of the federal judiciary at risk as well . in a 5-4 majority , the court ruled that corporations are “ associations of individuals , ” and thus that some limits on the quantity of money corporations could spend on political campaigns violated their first amendment right to freedom of speech . as a result , republicans have a good chance to form a conservative majority on the nine-member supreme court that could last for decades , particularly if it were winning again the presidency in 2020 .
lopez obrador and his supporters can be expected to work relentlessly to thwart his plans . but they are unlikely to derail his rule of law by his own government . the underlying stability highlighted by mexico ’s post-election crisis is also apparent elsewhere in latin america . whatever the potential for a left-wing shift this year in some latin american countries , others , including mexico , chile , and brazil , are clearly less vulnerable to the types of populist rule that we have seen in venezuela and bolivia . calderon about the task will not be easy .
next year will be crucial for italy and germany to mark the end of the current political cycle , as well as the beginning of the new european commission . there will be time to react – by showing strong leadership and prioritizing growth over shortsighted policies – but that the time is running down and the clock is ticking . nobody wants the eu to go down because of its citizens ’ disaffection . no one wants the eu to default , owing to its citizens ’ disaffection . next year will be crucial , for italy marks the end of the current political cycle and the beginning of the new european commission .
colombo – as china ’s economy slows and the developed world ’s growth remains anemic this year , governments across asia are working to keep their economies on an upward trajectory . one thing is already clear : we can not expect the rest of the world to welcome our economic ambitions the way it once opened its arms to china ’s rapid ascent as an economic powerhouse , or – in earlier decades , cheered on by japan ’s growth and the so-called asian tigers , including south korea ’s . indeed , this year , free trade appears to be the scapegoat for the world ’s assorted populists and demagogues . in sri lanka , where i am prime minister , the challenge is to find ways to accelerate our already steady economic growth . today , we europeans are witnessing , on an almost daily basis , with fierce political assailants on the tools and policies that have helped lift hundreds of millions of our citizens out of poverty .
this supra-sectarian platform calls for the central government of iraq ’s natural resource and defusing a looming referendum to placate the status of the city of kirkuk . in fact , change in the country is where sunni-shiite cooperation is coming in . broadly unnoticed , iraqi sunni and shia centralists have managed over the past few months to form a united parliamentary platform that abandons sectarian tensions behind . more than 100 followers of ayad allawi , al sadr , and others have joined their ranks . this supra-sectarian platform calls for the central government of iraq ’s natural resource and deferring a looming referendum to settle the status of kirkuk .
as matters stand , a case can be made that the french will never come to believe that the state lacks the power , globalization , or no globalization whatsoever . so the truth must lie elsewhere : the french are not hopeless in politics ; they simply wait for a genuine leader . political fervor , it seems , has not vanished in rousseau and danton . so the truth must lie elsewhere : the french are not hopeless for politics ; they simply wait for a genuine leader . yes , the french are incorrigible lovers of the welfare state .
london – next week , governments will gather in warsaw , poland , for a crucially agreed round of climate negotiations , with both expectations and ambition running at an all-time low . fundamental carbon arithmetic illustrates the scale of the problem . the warsaw talks are a staging post on a path to the 2015 united nations climate summit in paris , at which governments will seek to forge an agreement that will prevent dangerous climate change – defined as global warming of more than two degrees celsius . failure would expose future generations to catastrophic climate risks , while trapping millions of people in poverty due to increasingly frequent , intense , and protracted droughts , floods , and storms . but this need not be like it : the warsaw meeting provides an opportunity to galvanize action on one of the most noxious powers driving climate change , the billions of dollars spent by governments to fuel fossil-fuel subsidies .
and , indeed , the g-20 has introduced few social , environmental , or climate-related criteria to its “ wish list ” of mega-projects that each member country will submit to its summit in turkey in november . in a march 2015 letter to the g-20 , a group of scientists , environmentalists , and opinion leaders warned that ramping up investment in megaprojects is jeopardizing irreversible and catastrophic damage to the environment . similarly , the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which “ infrastructure ” and long-lived products that lock societies into greenhouse-gas-intensive emissions pathways , may be difficult or very costly to turn out to be changing . in fact , now that the us is already sucking up about one-and-a-half-planets ’ worth of resources , ” ” the authors explain . “ infrastructure choices are needed to mitigate , rather than aggravate , the situation . ”
perhaps the most telling recent example of the central bank , using forward guidance , was european central bank president mario draghi ’s july 2012 announcement that the ecb will do whatever it takes ” to ensure the euro ’s survival . likewise , mark carney , in his first policy activism as governor of the bank of england , announced forward guidance on short-term interest-rate hikes . the fed , for example , has committed itself to keeping interest rates low at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 % , a move that has arguably lowered long-term borrowing costs . that pledge alone stabilized borrowing costs and dramatically reduced interest-rate spreads for struggling eurozone countries . while the effects of such interest-rate guidance on an economy can not be fixed without additional data , there are plenty of arguments in its favor .
first , america should consider establishing diplomatic relations with iran and bringing diplomats to the ground . this would not be an easy process , and might well meet considerable iranian resistance there . but iranians have diplomatic relationships with other members of their primary interlocutor in talks about its nuclear program , the sanctions-minded p-5 +1 group ( china , france , germany , france , russia , the united kingdom , and the us ) , and re-think iran-us diplomatic ties would shorten lines of communication and close the 444-day chapter of 1979-1981 . indeed , just the opposite response is likely , with a us effort to tighten sanctions still further . yet , just when america did adopt a “ bomb and talk ” approach with serbs during the bosnian war dénouement , america must be willing to “ sanction and speak ” when it comes to iran , thereby creating more space for an eventual diplomatic strategy .
to keen observers , the ipl represented more than the league of sports ; it signaled nothing less than the emergence of a fledgling india . by watching the ipl , the glamour , and the excess came an antidote to the hidebound statist mentality that has produced india ’s economic stagnation in the past . in the ipl ’s glitz , the glamour , and the excess lay an antidote to the hidebound statist mentality that has produced india ’s economic stagnation in the past . to keen observers , the ipl represented more than the league of sports ; it signaled no less than the emergence of a new india . here was a venture to open new vistas for enterprises and call off the imaginations of young people to emulate the entrepreneurial qupromoters , promoters , players , and fans .
this superficiality has stemmed from the fact that , although communism was a thoroughly “ modern ” idea , modernity in romania goes only deep . state banks , the state approved public societies ( trade unions , for example ) , big state companies , acting little differently in romania today , than in feudal guilds behaved in medieval europe . at the 20th century ’s close , romania ( like bulgaria , russia , ukraine , and other heavily sovietized societies ) looks more like a “ neo-feudal ” state than a “ modern society . ” this superficiality has results in terms of the fact that , although communism was a thoroughly “ modern ” idea , modernity in romania goes only deep . at its whim in the state , for example , groups can be exonerated from paying taxes , or have their posts and work made unchallengeable by law .
but the fundamental problem is that up until now , at every historical juncture , the palestinians have refused to accept a compromise and consequently failed within nation-building . in 1993 , following the oslo agreements , the palestinian authority established under yasir arafat became a further militarized authoritarian regime , extremely much like syria and egypt , and did nothing to alleviate the suffering of palestinian refugees . it was this failure that brought hamas to power . on the other hand , diplomacy means can bring about the release of an israeli soldier and put a stop to fire qassam rockets from gaza into israel , an everyday occurrence that challenged the credibility of the new israeli government , under prime minister ehud olmert . it was this failure that led hamas to power .
for example , japanese elites are generally inclined to favor continuity over change . in their thinking , hard power in the united states is more important than its soft power , and their vision of an america “ “ “ “ bound ” to lead in the world is largely unchanged . to them , america overcomes the strategic counterweight to the need to balance china . in asia , indonesia may look “ europe ” in its craze , but it essentially represents an anomaly , easily explainable by obama ’s brief indonesian upbringing . otherwise , and for very different reasons , majority asian elites wait to see the rising possibility that obama would win in a state of victory with some bewilderment and even apprehension .
canberra – last year , north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s kim jong-un and us president donald trump struck kindergarten insults at each other ’s – “ rocket man is on a suicide mission , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” said trump of kim ; “ the mentally deranged us dotard , ” ” ” while threatening to reduce east asia to a post-atomic wasteland . now , in an astounding and dramatic development , the two are supposed to meet . kim reportedly is willing to denuclearize and eager to speak directly to trump . but optimism about that turn of events must be tempered by cautious realism . built on a surfeit by an end to the past , north korea has been the nuclear issue of hell .
despite its domestic difficulties and the loss of global visibility that accompanied mandela ’s retirement , south africa still regards such an emerging power as an emerging power comparable in status and aspiration to , say , brazil , india , and nigeria . south africa is seeking a broader and more influential role , reinforced by its palpable standing as the regional hegemon . they are prone to proactive and assertive foreign policies , and perhaps more so than a middle-power status and a limited niche-style influence enjoyed by canada , sweden , or saudi arabia . the nepad , a new partnership for africa ’s development , an organization designed to promote decent and appropriate norms of economic and political development across the entire continent , has stood at the heart of such policies . such powers are seeking a potent and constructive regional role , and perhaps in some instances global ones .
indeed , turkey never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker . it aspires to join the european union , and would bring the eu to our three borders , even as the us , too , has insisted on joining the single day . indeed , turkey never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker . earlier this year , after the american-led effort to mediate a middle eastern peace settlement was beginning to falter , turkey took away its middling job in both the israeli-palestinian conflict and the syria conflict . now , in the immediate wake of the russia-georgia crisis , turkey ’s leaders once again stepped forward to take a leadership role in the caucasus .
like a neighboring country , india would face disturbing consequences if it returned to power in afghanistan , as it would iran , which will not sit idly by if sectarian strife intensified and shia become the targets of a resurgent taliban . like a neighboring country , india would face disturbing consequences if it returned to power in afghanistan , as would iran , which would not sit idly by if sectarian strife intensified and shia become the targets of a resurgent taliban . the west needs a way out before the bloodletting begins again in earnest . my fear is that we have not seen the last time either al qaeda or the taliban launch afghanistan . my fear is that we have not seen the last one of al qaeda or afghan politicians .
the law that applies to all other companies should apply to the banks as well . moreover , governments should guarantee insolvent banks ’ loans to nonfinancial companies , as do private customers ’ current , fixed-term , and savings deposits by reforming nonbank laws . the law that applies to all other companies should apply to the banks as well . an economy with neither bankruptcies nor the rule of law that conforms as equitably to all is not a market economy . and governments must respond to the banks ’ threats by proclaiming their willingness to let insolvent banks be judged so badly .
but gross capital flows are from emerging-market to emerging-market equities , through large banks now implicitly backed by the state in the us and europe . from international investors ’ perspective , banks that are “ too big to fail ” are the perfect facilities for park their reserves , as long as the sovereign in question remains solvent . that was not a good idea , because it led to the great ( for now ) debt crisis of 1982 . but , again , what will those banks do with that funding ? when some similarities issued back in the 1970s – the so-called “ recycling of the oil surplus ” – banks in western financial centers extended loans to latin america , communist poland , and communist romania .
companies in south africa are stagger from losing so many workers to aids . but plagues the transition is about more than health crises ; they signify a deeper malaise . companies in south africa stagger from losing so many workers to aids . so put aside how these diseases are virulent and can spread more easily , or the notion that the fortunate can bear some of the moral responsibility for welfare gains in the poor and ill , and simply consider the economic consequences of plagues of the transition . the world bank calls aids , “ the foremost threat to the african development . ”
erdoğan ’s post-coup crackdown is far from the only source of tensions between turkey and the west , particularly the eu . turkey insists that visa-free travel for turkish citizens visiting the eu , pledged by eu governments in january , should deliver this year . but , with turkey having so far failed to comply with agreed conditions , including overhauling its counterterrorism legislation , that may not happen , an outcome that has made the coup attempt all the more likely . that is why the coming months , in which turkey and the eu hash out contentious issues , are so critical . turkey insists that visa-free travel for turkish citizens visiting the eu , promised by eu governments in january , is expected to deliver this year .
moreover , during his recent election campaign , netanyahu has pledged that if re-elected , he will impede the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank by “ taking control of the entire region . ” as long as the palestinians are oppressed and denied a nation-state in their own way , a conflict is set to occur . yet , over the last 13 years , netanyahu has enthusiastically endorsed the expansion of jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem . at his word , we should be taking it . as he is well known , settlements are a physical roadblock standing in the way of a contiguous palestinian state .
given such incompetence , it is not surprising that successive reforms were far-reaching . but such reforms went in precisely the opposite direction from today ’s proposed changes : fewer restrictions on policymakers ’ discretion , more power on boards , and a larger role for new york fed all to permit the federal reserve system to react more rapidly and robustly to crises . heedless of its responsibility as emergency lender , it allowed the banking system to collapse . when financial stability hung through the balance of 1933 , reserve banks ’ failure to cooperate prevented effective action . it failed to prevent the money supply from contracting in the early stages of the great depression .
pittsburgh – the wall street journal recently ran a front-page article announced that the monetary-policy “ doves , ” a ” who predicted low inflation in the united states , had gotten the better of “ hawks , ” ” ” who argued that the fed ’s monthly purchases of long-term securities , or so-called quantitative easing ( qe ) would unleash faster price growth . the report was correct but misleading , for it failed to mention why there was so little , if any , inflation in america today . were the doves the right , or just the lucky enough , to be lucky ? neither the hawks nor the doves ( and anybody else ) expected it . pittsburgh , the wall street journal , recently pumped out a front-page article that the monetary-policy “ doves , ” the ” who thought that low inflation in the united states had gotten the better of the “ hawks , ” who argued that the fed ’s monthly purchases of long-term securities , or so-called quantitative easing ( qe ) would unleash faster price growth .
reducing high-risk pregnancies , curbing unwanted pregnancies , and spacing out births has proved to be a drop in the newborn and newborn death rate . moreover , cutting an birth rate that is extremely high in many lmics would help to reduce the strain on these countries ’ health-care systems by bringing an end to the newborn and newborn care and immunization rate . by reducing the rate at which unwanted pregnancies are extremely high , family planning also decreases the death rate of unsafe abortions . this is not only good for mothers , but it is also good for them . the guttmacher institute estimates that fully meeting women ’s need for contraception would prevent 600,000 maternal and newborn deaths annually .
the saudis also recoil under a barrage of criticism of their wahhabi brand of islam , which is widely blamed for incubating extremism and inspiring terrorism . king salman bin abdulaziz al saud is the country ’s ’s above-the-fray ruler , but his son , prince mohammad bin salman al saud , currently wields a significant degree of power . as defense minister , mohammad continues the saudi policy of supporting anti-assad rebels in syria , in concert with turkey , while unleashing a war on the pro-iranian tribesmen in yemen ( at an enormous humanitarian cost ) . against this backdrop , the kingdom is taking the fight against its enemies . the saudis , too , are recoiling under a barrage of islamist criticism of its wahhabi brand of islam , which is widely blamed for incubating extremism and inspiring terrorism .
the american public is war-weary , and us president donald trump is keen to declare the end of the longest international conflict in america ’s history before the 2020 presidential election . america ’s ongoing peace talks with the taliban , as well as the impending reduction of america ’s military presence in the country , provide an unequivocal recognition of this . here , too , america has achieved many of its initial core goals . the answer to the first question , then , is both yes and no . america ’s ongoing peace talks with the taliban , as well as america ’s impending reduction of america ’s military presence in the country , are a clear acknowledgement of this .
just five months ago in london , we hosted the “ ppp days ” conference with the support of other multilateral institutions , the g20 and the united nations . emerging-market officials would make accreditation by demonstrating the power to apply their know-how practically . one useful instrument in the effort is “ infrascope , ” ” a benchmarking index created by the economist the imf that assesses emerging-market countries ’ capacity across the asia-pacific region , latin america , africa , eastern europe , and the former soviet republics in the commonwealth of independent states to deliver sustainable ppps . the us had plenty of experts – some 300 of the public and private sectors of 30 countries – been trying to provide an answer to a simple question : “ what would it take to double down on private infrastructure investment in emerging markets ? ” emerging-market officials would earn accreditation by demonstrating the power of their knowledge practically .
meanwhile , the israeli government wants to continue building settlements in the occupied territories , amid total violation of international law and minimum requirements for peace detailed in the “ roadmap ” ” ” ” ” yet elucidate , where israel ’s borders would occur . the results are mixed , at best . the american efforts , led by the special envoy , george mitchell , have shown clear that the current ruling coalition in israel is incapable of doing the bare minimum necessary for the peace process . the palestinians have adhered to all israeli and international security demands , while binyamin netanyahu ’s israeli government , which gives lip-service to the two-state solution , has yet elucidated , where israel ’s borders will be . the obama administration has staked its reputation on getting israelis and palestinians to agree , on a minimum , on security and borders .
this is exactly what happened in latin america in the 1980s , when mexico into a moratorium on external debt servicing in august 1982 sparked the region-wide debt crisis . with that , crises spill across borders , affecting entire regions or even the whole class in the emerging economies . the same thing occurred in east asia in the 1990s : the crisis began in thailand in july 1997 with the collapse of the baht and quickly spread to other east asian countries . it became a broad-based emerging-economy crisis in august 1998 after russia imposed a moratorium on payments by commercial banks to foreign lenders . then contagion signs burst , as increasingly risk-averse investors , particularly short-term investors from developed-country living standards , began withdrawing funds from other countries to cover the losses that they incurred in crisis-originated economies .
as a result , prominent economists , including the senior staff of the international monetary fund , have become increasingly critical of oda in recent years , claiming failure to contribute to faster economic growth . but un research makes clear that if blatantly driven politically driven aid is excluded , the evidence points to a robust positive relationship . as a result , prominent economists , including senior staff at the international monetary fund , have become increasingly critical of oda in recent years , claiming failure to contribute to faster economic growth . unfortunately , despite recent efforts to enhance aid effectiveness , at best , progress has been modest , not least because average financing for projects has fallen by more than two-thirds . debt is another side to the development-dilemma .
denver – for many foreign audiences , the united states ’ ’ ’ primary election for the 2012 us presidential vote – which will , alas , continue to rage in the tpp – must be a scary display of what americans and their leaders have no idea about foreign policy . when jon huntsman , an early contender , displayed some genuine intellectual heft by making some useful points in dealing with china , punctuated by cursory display of his own mastery of mandarin , some other candidates responded with derision . to have even recognized the chinese perspective appears to have been disqualifying for huntsman , who soon ended his candidacy . when jon huntsman , an early contender , displayed some genuine intellectual heft by making few useful points about dealing with china , punctuated by extolling his mastery of mandarin , some other candidates responded with derision . to have even known the chinese perspective , it appears , was disqualifying for huntsman , who soon ended his candidacy .
i helped launch the first safe schools initiative , following boko haram ’s abduction of 276 schoolgirls in chibok , nigeria , last april . the agenda includes building better school fortifications , linking schools to police stations by mobile telecommunication , and creating community security groups – consisting of teachers , parents , police , community leaders , and young people themselves – to support secure safe zones for education . nigeria ’s initiative is focused on school and community interventions , with special measures for largely at-risk and vulnerable children . the first set of schools has now received funding , with the first cohort of the most at-risk girls relocating to government schools in safer regions of the country . a fund has so far mobilized $ 30 million from business , the nigerian government and international donors , and a multi-donor trust fund at the un .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . luxembourg – as world leaders gather in madrid for the united nations climate change conference ( cop25 ) this year – they must address more than future targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions . at the same time , they must address the harm to the people and livelihoods that climate change is already causing . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
this favorable performance led private forecasters and government officials to forecast continued strong gdp growth in 2011 , with higher output , employment , and incomes leading to further increases in consumer spending and a self-sustaining recovery . a one-year cut of the payroll tax rate by two percentage points was enacted to take a lock in this favorable outlook . unfortunately , the supposed recovery in consumer spending did n’t occur . rising food and energy prices outpaced gains in nominal wages , causing real average weekly earnings to decline in january , while continuing declines in home prices lowered wealth for most households . as a result , real personal consumer expenditures rose at an annualized rate of just over 1 % in january , down from the previous quarter of the rate of 4 % .
instead , we are left with usual microeconomic measures to prepare people for algorithmic employment , that is , use the big data to match those with those with whom they will need to remain consumers . instead , we are left with conventional microeconomic measures to prepare people to become algorithmic employment , that is , using the big data to match those with the jobs that they will need to remain consumers . in the case of education , the report urges employers and colleges to collaborate to develop talent “ pipelines . ” it highlights miami , for example , a college ’s ’s ’s “ programs in animation and game development , ” working with companies like pixar animation studios and google . likewise , toyota “ built its own advanced manufacturing technician program to give a pathway to us-search students .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . moreover , according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the consequences of climate change are unfolding far more rapidly than predicted . at last year ’s un report on progress toward achieving the sdgs showed that the number of people facing hunger actually increases as it draws to malaria cases .
the basque country has established a program called the local agenda , 21 designed to support the establishment of local sustainability plans across the region . as a result of the program , nearly all of the basque municipalities have adopted such plans , consisting of more than 25,000 projects in areas like mobility , waste management , and economic development . such local plans are now driving sustainable development in the region , with knowledge-sharing among municipal authorities laying the foundation for further progress . meanwhile , south australia has developed the most supportive regulatory framework for renewable-energy investment in australia , allowing for increased renewables ’ share in power generation from virtually zero in 2003 to nearly 40 % today . québec will invest more than $ 3.3 trillion toward this goal by 2020 , contributing to its economy ’s growth .
back in 1931 , after britain , and some two dozen other countries suspended gold convertibility , allowing their currencies to depreciate , countries that stuck to the gold standard found themselves on a deflationary vice . in a desperate effort to do anything – anything , to defend their economies – swung into protectionism , imposing “ exchange-rate dumping ” duties , and import quotas to compensate for the loss of competitiveness generated by their own increasingly overvalued currencies . but the restrictions on trade were a poor substitute for domestic reflationary measures , because they did little to arrest the downward spiral in output and prices . as such , they did nothing to stabilize rickety banking systems . in 1931 , after britain , and some two dozen other countries suspended gold convertibility , allowing their currencies to depreciate , countries that stuck to the gold standard found themselves in a deflationary vice .
madrid – since its inception in oslo almost two decades ago , the israeli-palestinian peace process has been stymied by the two sides ’ dysfunctional political systems . hostage to an impossible coalition and a settlement movement by the free-lance fanatics , israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’s leadership is being gravely compromised . today , the clique surrounding palestinian president mahmoud abbas embodies the bitter deception that the peace process that began with the oslo agreement has meant to the palestinians . his palestinian counterparts are hardly in any better position . moreover , the palestinian authority has come neither to represent the majority of palestinians nor to govern through democratic means .
this has fueled a growing sense of hopelessness – especially among males – manifested in rising disempowerment , growth suffers , and the chances of reaching a prosperous form of inclusiveness decline . the result is a vicious circle in which government finds it increasingly difficult to do what is needed . countries experiencing high and rising economic inequality often face mounting political fragility and policy dysfunction . as policymaking becomes erratic , lost credibility , and become choked by gridlock , growth suffers , and the chances of achieving a prosperous form of inclusiveness decline . but government intervention is critical to addressing problems facing developed-country workers today , which markets can not address on their own .
before world war ii , soccer clubs often have an ethnic or religious component : tottenham hotspur in london was a “ jewish ” , ” ” ” ” while the arsenal was “ iranian . ” the tribe can be a club , a clan , or a nation . the vestiges of these markings remain : the ajax of amsterdam still dined with its provincial opponents as the “ jew club . ” and glasgow clubs , the celtic and rangers , still form a split between religious affiliation , the celtic being catholic and rangers . but a common race or religion , however fundamental they are .
this flies in the face of the central pledge governments made when they signed on to the sdgs : that those countries farthest out of targets would benefit most of the fastest progress . here , too , is about spending more equitably . in a new report to be launched at the imf-world bank spring meetings , saving children documents the glaring gap between health risks that are heavy skewed towards the poorest children , and the gains in public spending are often skewed in favor of better-off households . the world bank could help to improve accountability for meeting this commitment by working with the un and national agencies to track and report on the pace at which disparities in key indicators , from mortality to education , are being narrowed . in the language of the agenda , “ no one should be left behind . ”
two examples suffice to illustrate the impact : rice prices have tripled , while electricity consumption has been down by two-thirds since at least two decades ago . my personal memories of north korea , now nearly 10 years old , constitute a mildly poor and depressed country . pyongyang , the capital , was darkness and deserted , illuminated by the cavalcade removed us from its formal housing to the opera house , only to return to obscurity in the us . my personal memories of north korea , now nearly 10 years old , have come of age in a rather optimistic time . kim jong-il was greeted with the same fervor as he entered the opera house that today marks public mourning of his passing .
the best way to reduce violence against women , lift them out of poverty , and empower them to be full and equal members of society is to break the cycle of early marriage and childbirth . in rural india , for example , recruiters for a well-paid back-office job have visited randomly selected villages over a period of three years . female employment rose , and women aged 15-21 were 5-6 % fewer likely to marry or give birth over this period . such large-scale change is not easy to achieve , but when girls can stay in school longer and enjoy the decent job opportunities they have at their birth , they are likely to marry and bear children later in life . but there are other , more gender goals to consider .
though trump has distanced himself from bolton ’s remarks , us vice president mike pence warned only three weeks later that if north korea does not produce a deal , it will nonetheless meet with libya ’s ’s fate . choe son hui , a vice foreign minister , responded by threatening a “ nuclear-to-nuclear showdown ” if washington stuck to his “ illegal and outrageous ” belligerence . vice foreign minister kim kye-gwan delivered the north ’s erratic response : “ we do n’t hide our feeling of repugnance toward him . ” the north was uninterested in a dialogue that focused on the coerced ’s unilateral nuclear abandonment . choe son hui , a vice minister of foreign affairs , responded by threatening a “ nuclear-to-nuclear showdown ” if the washington stuck to its “ illegal and outrageous ” belligerence .
with the us current-account deficit now exceeding 5 % of gdp , america ’s foreign debt is rising fast . but no country can continue to accumulate debt forever – and what can not last sooner rather than later must end . after nearly 15 years of unprecedented growth – interrupted only by the brief slowdown of 2000-2001 – the united states amassed an enormous stock of foreign liabilities , equivalent to 25 % of its gdp . back in early 1985 , when america ’s current-account deficit peaked at $ 120 billion , about one-third of today ’s level at current prices , the rest stopped financing it . the result was a precipitous fall in the value of the us dollar , which depreciated by 50 % against the deutschemark .
princeton – the united states has moved from the high of the recent us presidential election to the low of one short week ’s political sex scandal . for many non-americans , the election produced barack obama ’s welcome and reassuring election , whereas the resignation of daoud petraeus as director of the cia amounted to an futile , self-inflicted wound . for many non-americans , the election brought barack obama ’s welcome and reassuring triumph , whereas the resignation of daoud petraeus as director of the cia amounted to an futile , self-inflicted wound . in fact , both elections and petraeus ’s resignation are pieces of a bigger good thing : an america living up to its promises . the election was a reminder of many americans that the us is a country committed to and able to continue progress , of moving forward toward an ideal vision .
indeed , one key reason for creating the international monetary fund has been to monitor exchange-rate developments with an explicit goal of preventing beggar-thy-neighbor policies . this is one reason why the swiss move comes as a surprise . switzerland , indeed , would constitute one key reason to develop the international monetary fund , with its explicit objective of preventing beggar-thy-neighbor policies . its first casualty would be whatever small scope remains to be gained through international policy coordination . the other would comprise the world ’s international monetary system .
likewise , die linke ’s call to abolish nato , together with its cozying up to russia , has left the party politically toxic in most west germany . the second , commonly cited cause of germany ’s resilience against populism , is its economic strength . the country ’s unemployment rate is currently at a record low , and its gdp has grown at nearly 10 % since 2013 . a call by björn höcke , the afd ’s status leader at the thuringia , for a 180-degree veered off from its post-world war ii tradition of atoning for the crimes of the nazi era , and afd deputy leader alexander gauland ’s reference to “ disposing of ” germany ’s turkish integration minister , “ anatolia ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” in most of western germany . add to that a well-functioning welfare system , and it is clear why the inequality-focused outrage that fueled voter revolts elsewhere is gaining little traction in germany .
just last month , russian president vladimir putin signed new laws authorizing punishment by individuals and online media for spreading so-called fake news and information that has “ disrespects ” the state . vast fines have been leveled against independent publications , broadcasters , and bloggers . us president donald trump is attempting to move in the same direction . his steady branding of journalists as “ liars ” ” and his “ enemies of the people ” reflect the nazis ’ preferred media label : the lügenpresse ( lying press ) . china and turkey , both olympic-level jailers of journalists , have rammed up their repression in recent years .
bush ’s africa commission , like the un millennium project , has found that africa needs around $ 50 billion per year in aid by 2010 . yet official american aid to africa stands at just $ 3 billion a year , and much of that cover salaries for america ’s consultants , rather than investments in africa ’s own needs . without the benefits of trade , much of rural africa is struggling at the subsistence level . without the gains in trade , much of rural africa is struggling through the subsistence level . america ’s fair share of the total amounts to around $ 15 billion a year .
indeed , north korea is now the ninth state with nuclear weapons , joining the five permanent members of the un security council , israel , indonesia , and pakistan . how the world reacts to north korea will likely affect calculations about other would-be nuclear powers , including iran . how the world responds to north korea seems likely to affect calculations about other would-be nuclear powers , including iran . maintaining peace in a world in which literally scores are on nuclear triggers will be far tougher — and the consequences of failure far more destructive . initial reactions to north korea ’s nuclear test were uniformly critical , culminating ( thus far ) at un security council resolution 1718 that condemns the test , demands that north korea resume full cooperation with the international atomic energy agency and imposes a wide range of military , political , and economic sanctions .
peter navarro , an economics professor at the university of california at irvine , will be director of the national trade council – a new white house policy shop to be established on a par with the us national security council and the national economic council . both ross and navarro have also been co-authors of the economic-policy position paper published on trump ’s campaign web site stretching any semblance of credibility . industrialist wilbur ross , commerce secretary-, has been vocal in his desire to be abrogate america ’s “ dumb free ” trade deals . navarro is one of america ’s most extreme china hawks . both ross and navarro have also been co-authors of the economic-policy stance paper published on trump ’s campaign web site stretching any semblance of credibility .
the euro-dollar exchange rate thus barely shifted ; in reality , the euro appreciated against a basket of major currencies . the clash of interests among the eurozone ’s member states was straightforward . but , because policymakers constantly threatened the exit of qe , markets inferred that the ecb was not committed to sustained stimulus . for their part , eurozone inflation became “ de-anchored ” ” from monetary-policy decisions . the ecb then declared victory , and then withdrew qe just when the euro appreciated against a basket of major currencies .
experience suggests that the importing legal and regulatory norms seldom worked quite well . the american antitrust law , when transplanted to japan after world war ii by general macarthur , for example , led only six criminal prosecution in thirty years . even after europe ’s former empires had retreated , the laws still exported to foster development in post-colonial countries . for centuries , western laws had come to the fore with their colonial rulers . in many cases , however , these imported laws were ignored , selectively enforced , or were complied only in form rather than substance .
drug companies and other firms may well be eager to purchase the biobanks on which they can test their products for differential responses according to a patient ’s genetic make-up . but other firms have been accused of having more interest in developing a “ biobank ” ” ” on which they can test their products for differential responses according to patients ’ genetic make-up . this new development , called the center for genetics and society , writes , “ pharmacogenetics , ” aims to deliver better-calibrated dosages and more effective therapies . as jesse reynolds of the center for genetics and society writes , “ just as the traditional newspapers ’ business model aims to extract revenues not from their readers but from advertisers , personal genomics companies see potential profits not from consumers themselves , but from compiled databases , likely within the means of selling access to them . there is certainly nothing wrong with this , but it seems odd that customers effectively pay a firm for the privilege of donating their dna to their database .
and , with the face value of the debt unchanged , a psychological drag on expectations and investment could linger . even with german-level interest rates unchanged , greece would still have to run a primary surplus of at least 2 % of gdp , still quite large , and far off today ’s deficit . europe ’s holdings of greek government debt might , in turn , pretend that it is worth its full value . and , with the face value of being unchanged , the psychological drag on expectations and investment could linger . the question is whether changing the coupons , perhaps coupled with extensions of maturities , would be large enough to stabilize the greek economy and restore growth .
against this background , “ neoliberal ” reforms – such as the rapid economic opening and financial liberalization promoted by the international monetary fund – have made economies even more vulnerable to external shocks . current-account deficits have been growing , resulting in frequent foreign-exchange crises . excessive fiscal and monetary expansion has made these economies especially unstable , making it more vulnerable to external shocks . venezuela is a case in point . a combination of social polarization , inadequate institutions , and weak economic fundamentals has made it harder for even reform-minded governments to escape the short-termism and lay the groundwork for long-term development .
movies produced for sex gratification of consumers reveal cultural norms of restrictions , transgression , and otherness . interestingly , many purveyors of pornography were originally thought to think that a better quality video would make their product more desirable than other people . high levels of output , however , seem to have been much less popular . so a “ casual ” production-style manufacturing style has been adopted , similar to the design shown and ripped jeans . in fact , porn is so explicitly tuned to consumers ’ tastes that shifts could indicate change in a society almost immediately .
but he has never been very red in order to lead such a country . former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra have done – and still do – the job . both clowns have always played a role in politics . neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to be a democratic leader . the question , then , is which of the better .
so , when they hope for survival and thriving in today ’s egalitarian political climate , they will need to come up with bold solutions . during an earlier era of urban-based dynamism , in early sixteenth-century england , the rich merchant family built low-rent-seekers that were then allocated to the world ’s poor . if they are priced out or otherwise , they will need to exclude those earning less , they will have sacrificed the openness that made them attractive at the front line . so , if they are looking to survive and thrive in today ’s egalitarian political climate , they will need to come up with bold solutions . during an earlier era of urban-based dynamism , in augsburg , germany , still provides low rent social housing that was then allocated to the poor .
georges clémenceau , jean jaurès , and raymond poincaré , during the early twentieth century , did not pander to the nearly one-half of the electorate that , during the dreyfus affair , had exiled themselves in the republic . nor did charles de gaulle have any qualms about telling the communists of algeria that , finally , had failed to comprehend them . france must now recall these great moments in its republican tradition , and hold them up as a model for today ’s leaders . for what will be needed in holding territories that the republic almost lost to the fn is political bravery of the sort that , for the moment , france stands in short supply . nor did charles de gaulle have any qualms about telling french algeria ’s proponents that he did n’t want their votes to support his government .
but , with the end of the cold war , many assumed that their institutional embodiment , the north atlantic treaty organization , would fade away . it did n’t , because our bond is based not just on shared threats , but on our shared ideals . that bond remains vitally important for our own values , and our own security . it could no longer fade further than our yearning for freedom might wane . and we could know that those landings made a unique bond among our continents .
i hope that this issue does not derail the chinese effort to use the olympics as an opportunity to show the world that their country has emerged once again as one of the world ’s great leaders . in so many areas , the chinese have been so clever . they concocted an “ one country , two systems ” formula for hong kong . is it really beyond their political system ’s capacity to work out a formula for tibet that recognizes its cultural and religious autonomy within the chinese state ? the chinese have , indeed , been so clever in so many areas .
sarajevo – ever since the twin disasters of 2016 , the united kingdom ’s ’s brexit referendum and us president donald trump ’s election has triggered widespread anxieties about a “ global wave of populism ” and hand-wringing over the unfolding follies of so-called “ direct democracy . ” ever since , there have been calls to re-empower the – gatekeepers , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” who is a polite way of saying that the unswerving masses ought to be kept as far away as political choice can be . in the uk , voters asked for an overly simplistic in-or-out question ; in the united states , the 2016 republican party primaries gave over irresponsible voters and radical activists alike . and that shift would occur at a time of increasing challenge elsewhere around the world . since then , there have been calls to re-empower the – gatekeepers , ” ” ” ” ” ”
berkeley – addressing the issue is not enough . indeed , you must implement a solution , and are willing and able to change course if it turns out that you did n’t really know very much as you ’ve thought it was . that ’s the message of two other recent books that , taken together , tell you all that you need to know about the 2008 financial crisis : what caused it , what could be done to prevent it from recurring , and why those things have yet to do so . in fact , the first book is the shifts and aftershocks , by the conservative british columnist martin wolf , that starts with cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for the economic catastrophe that continues to shape around the world today . its starting point is the enormous wealth surge among the world ’s richest 0.1 % , and 0.01 % , and consequent pressures for people , its governments , and companies to take on increasingly unsustainable levels of debt .
the second feature of the digital information age – a direct by-product of democratization – is information socialization . no traditional institutional media gatekeepers , political discourse is no longer based on a common set of facts . rather than receiving our information directly from institutional gatekeepers who , despite often-flawed execution , were fundamentally committed to encounter editorial norms , today we acquire it through peer-to-peer sharing . such peer networks can elevate content based on factors like clicks or engagement among friends , rather than on accuracy or importance . such peer networks can elevate content based on factors like clicks or engagement among friends , rather than on accuracy or importance .
to be sure , many other factors are at work , but the television-driven social atomization should not become understated . robert putnam , the chief scholar of the american community ’s declining sense of community , has found that a tv viewing is a central explanation for the degradation of “ social capital , ” a trust that binds communities together . time that used to be together within a community is now spent on it . americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago . moreover , heavy tv viewing has played a role in social fragmentation .
with the collapse of the soviet communist regime , america continues to enjoy a dominant role in space exploration for peaceful and scientific development . in fact , this dangerous , irresponsible action yet another key sign that china ’s rise as a global power lacks any guarantee that it will emerge as a peaceful nation once it grows powerful . lurking behind china ’s “ space ” ambitions is the spirit of the cold war , which continues to permeate the us ’s inner high-command circles , whose adversary unmistakably the united states . in fact , this dangerous and irresponsible turn serves another key sign that china ’s rise as a global power has lacks any guarantee that it becomes a peaceful nation once it grows strong . lurking behind china ’s struggle in space is the spirit of the cold war , which continues to permeate the us ’s inner high-command circles whose adversary unmistakably the united states .
every time a new , powerful scientific formulation seems , it must go through a period of abusive application . illegality and wrongdoers were artfully cloaked as an incontrovertible , science-tested natural law , “ the survival of the fittest . ” distinguished scientists have proclaim that our very destiny inscribed on the molecule of dna , and science-popularizers join the exultant choir , asserting that human beings are anything but “ programmed ” entities . today , it marks the turn of molecular genetics , and thus the future of work . temperament , obesity , heart disease , intelligence , homosexuality , or criminal conduct : all are said to reside within their genes .
at a time when russia and ukraine are still very much at war with each other , policymakers , local citizens , members of the ukrainian diaspora , and even some russians pack the streets of lebanon to celebrate a world-class jazz . lviv is also where one can find hope for europe ’s promise . beyond its vital cultural lives and geographic location , ukraine is strategically vital to the west . at a time when russia and ukraine remain very much at war with the us , policymakers , local citizens , members of the ukrainian diaspora , and even some russians pack the streets of lebanon to celebrate a world-class jazz . lviv is a deeply anti-russian and pro-european town ; but for five days it hosts the alpha jazz festival sponsored by a russian bank .
palo alto – it is still too soon to overestimate president barack obama ’s full economic impact and proposed policies ; but once-read indicates limited short-term benefits at great long-term cost . in fact , obama has outsourced details of the $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus to congress , and , no surprise , aging house barons stuffed it with pork and social engineering . several months later , just 4 % of gdp has been spent and brow-6 % of gdp , and the federal government is brow-stricken state governments , for example , demanding that california rescind a small pay cut for some of its unionized workers , or lose $ 7 billion in stimulus money . ( intervening in contract relations ex post to enforce union demands is an emerging characteristic of the us administration . ) the administration is exploiting the crisis-prone atmosphere to enact a grand agenda to re-engineer america ’s economy , from autos and financial services to healthcare , energy , and distribution of income .
the eu views the world as a zero-sum strategic contest , in which america should look out for itself . to be sure , the us claims to be stepping up its commitment to european security . as europeans well know , there is no way to build a wall in the mediterranean . unfortunately , in a world without common institutions to restrain sovereign nation-states from escalating conflicts with one another , the risks of the all-out war will increase substantially . moreover , it is disturbing enough that the trump administration hardly ever talks about upholding the postwar liberal international order .
accordingly , american employment shifted to higher-value-added activities , in turn promoting america ’s own higher incomes , too . china ’s gdp growth was driven by labor-intensive exports made more competitive by the transfers of technology and knowledge from america and other western european countries . meanwhile , america ’s consumer growth was heavily benefiting from falling relative prices of manufactured goods in the tradable side of the us economy . the old model served both parties well enough for three decades . this , coupled with massive chinese public and private investment ( enabled by high – and , more recently , excessive – saving ) , underpinned rising incomes for millions of chinese .
this is not the first time nato has appeared to be on its last legs . many arrived near the same conclusion prior to the end of 2014 , when the alliance had little to focus on outside the mission in afghanistan . then came trump , whose administration withdrew the rug from under europe , abandoned american leadership within the us-led international system and pursued a nationalistic , protectionist , and unilateralist foreign policy . a profound change in america ’s strategic priorities under president donald trump demands that europeans revisit long-held assumptions about their collective defense . when russia annexed crimea and launched a war to eastern ukraine , it breathed new lives into nato .
first , the fiscal-stimulus policies currently pushing america ’s annual growth rate above its 2 % potential are unsustainable . so america ’s federal reserve will continue to raise the federal funds rate from its current 2 % rate to at least 3.5 % by 2020 and likely to push it down short - and long-term interest rates just as america ’s dollar . second , since the stimulus was ill-timed , america ’s economy is now overheating , pushing inflation up above target . meanwhile , with inflation also spiking in other key economies , rising oil prices are contributing additional inflationary pressures . the stimulus is running out by 2020 , with a modest fiscal drag pulling the growth rate up from 3 % to slightly below 2 % .
increased sand drift were one of the effects observed during and after the first gulf war . sometimes that crust is strong enough to carry a person and sometimes not , much like the hardice crust that develops on the snowy climates . in reality , us and british troops may have only themselves to blame . this is because a desert in the region normally has a kind of crust , what arabs call “ a desert skin , ” consisting of sandy , and clay particles that have baked together or sintered , through the heat and sun . under the crust , it is the sand particles that are loose .
the sense of entitlement that sustained such male fecklessness has been steadily eroded ever since , a process that , like so much in american culture , played out on television . other women , like his self-proclaimed mistress juditss juditss juditbell , allegedly have sexual relations with mafia figures in the same way . popular scores like “ good wife ” show the pain and suffering of political spouses who anticipate that perpetuate a rigid upper lip and ladylike demeanor in the face of behavioral double standards . similarly , the sequence of “ mad man , ” ” ” ” with his dashing of advertising executives who consume women like lunchtime cocktails , plumbs the emptiness , and its destructiveness of early-1960 ’s male sexual prerogative . the sense of entitlement that sustained such male fecklessness has been steadily eroded ever since , a process that , like so much in american culture , played out on television .
ltcm also illustrates certain truths about financial-market crises . when push came to shove , with ltcm on the brink of collapse , the us federal reserve did not simply let “ market forces ” take their course . one powerful truth of late may year is that financial-market problems lie not just with hedge funds – which are the largest and least regulated gamblers – but with good old commercial banks that portrayed an uncanny ability to create difficulties by over-risky gaming themselves , whether in loans to emerging markets or to the likes of ltcm . oddly , chase manhattan reports that it had exposure some $ 32 billion in loans and derivatives at ltcm , roughly 2 % of total bank loans and credit exposure to just a one hedge fund ! the banks that had loaned huge sums , most of them undisturbed , are the same , which put in place around $ 175 billion of short-term loans to the five east asian developing countries ( indonesia , korea , malaysia , the philippines , thailand ) , and then abruptly reversed course , by yanked up tens of billions of loans in 1997 and 1998 .
cambridge – public-private cooperation , or coordination , receives considerable attention nowadays . while adam smith initiated us on the optimistic belief that an invisible hand would take care of most issues of coordination , in intervening economists ’ time discovered all sorts of market failures , informational imperfections , and incentives that gave rise to rules , regulation , and some other forms of government and societal intervention . to be sure , private-sector coordination was the essence of economics for the last 250 years . while adam smith started us on the optimistic belief that an invisible hand would take care of most issues of coordination , in intervening economists ’ time had discovered all sorts of market failures , informational imperfections , and incentives problem solving , giving rise to rules , regulation , and some other forms of government and societal interference . even the world economic forum was transformed into an international organization for public-private cooperation .
but while the trump administration has boosted america ’s own long-run growth potential , in some ways , the other side of the ledger is rather grim . for starters , a broad range of study – from the work of the late economist david landes to more recent research by the mit national daron acemoglu and the university of chicago ’s james a. robinson – finds that institutions and political culture are among the most prominent determinants of long-term growth . the president ’s daughter , ivanka trump , is spearheading the effort . recovery from the harm trump is inflicting on the institutions and the political culture within america can take years ; if so , the economic cost could be considerable . but while the trump administration has consolidated america ’s standing in some ways , the other side of the ledger is rather grim .
most economists now believe that russia can not maintain annual gdp growth at a rate above 2 % without another steady rise in the price of oil . but 2 % growth ( the respectable pace for an advanced economy ) would represent a major blow to russia ’s standing and putin ’s personal prestige , and could endanger domestic stability as long as jobs disappear in critical manufacturing sectors . putin is perplexed about how to counter the threat posed by slow growth . his central proposal , so far , has acted as a “ eurasian union ” – an expanded version of the current customs union among russia , belarus , and kazakhstan . this would provide a platform to remake trade , transportation , and other linkages among the ex-soviet countries and thereby capture regional markets for russian products , guarantee russian jobs , and re-assert russian political influence in its old neighbor .
with national supervisors often inclined to introduce a rosy picture of their countries ’ own institutions , no longer in charge , we can hope that the assessment will be more robust than the earlier stress tests conducted under the auspices of the european banking authority ( eba ) . the ecb , quite sensibly , wants all of the potential horrors to become visible ahead of schedule in order to avoid being blamed . those trials , unlike their equivalent in the united states , have failed to rebuild trust . but the creation of a european banking union was not the only important change in europe since the crisis . several banks that passed with flying colors were soon obliged to elevate new capital .
the key to ensuring europe ’s social-security systems ’ future , and thus its social model , is faster growth . the obstacles to growth are well known , and have existed for a long time without being eliminated . not all succeeded ; indeed , successes ( germany , for example ) outweigh the failures ( see greece ) . the key to ensuring europe ’s social-security system – and thus its social model – is more rapid growth . and , once again , it is hard to see how more europe would improve .
gazprom 's goal is to control not only the georgian gas industry , but also the only pipeline that feeds russia 's gas to both georgian and us armenia . typical was the russian holding company the promyslennye investory ( industrial investors ) that managed to get a major gold mine , and then half the plant producing gold alloys . but an utter lack of transparency allowed russian companies and their subsidiaries , registered in third countries , to snap most of the new offerings made possible . russia 's main foreign-policy apparatus in georgia is gazprom , the state-controlled gas monopoly . many state-owned firms have been privatized for ten times the sums yielded in asset sales under edvard shevardnadze 's previous government .
a mortality survey conducted by the international rescue committee ( irc ) and released earlier this year demonstrates that , since world war ii , such a conflict is the world ’s most lethal depression : an estimated 5.4 million people have died as their consequence of wars , and its lingering effects over the past decade . yet , even at a time when fighting is intensifying congo ’s indirect effects , its main victims are civilians caught in the crossfire . renewed fighting , coming just eight months after a promising peace initiative – known as the “ goma agreement , ” that means more civilian deaths and little opportunity for normality – to the eastern part of congo . a quarter-million people today are on the run , almost half of them on rebel-controlled territory with almost no access to aid . as is always the case , the main victims are civilians caught in the crossfire .
henry kissinger once said , “ peace can be achieved only through hegemony or through the balance of power . ” the same could perhaps be said of trade or even of globalization itself . it is no accident that the two great eras of globalization – a decade that led up to world war i and the past 75 years – have been characterized by a balance of power and hegemony , respectively . like all economic activity , it thrives when property rights are being respected , taxation is efficient and purposeful , credit letters are revered , tariffs and other barriers are removed , and so were . of course , trade entails more than the absence of conflict .
when properly integrated into a student-learning student , externships can provide a competitive edge on a college app essays and alumni interviews that admissions committees increasingly use to differentiate twenty-first-century leaders from the competing hordes of top-scoring test-takers . for small and medium-size enterprises , externships are providing much-needed creative manpower . our education system can no longer afford to wall it out of the industry . for small and medium-size enterprises , externships are providing much-needed creative manpower . externships offer the transparency and accountability of educators , and imbue the fearlessness of their students .
but a few million americans – black , white , and hispanic – now live in per capita incomes of less than $ 2 per day , essentially the same norm that the world bank uses to define destitution-level poverty in india or africa . elite schools recruit the wealthy to pay their bills , and the court minorities to redress centuries of race discrimination ; but this undoubtedly fosters resentment among the white working class , whose children find none of a ground in this brave new world . beyond that , america ’s much-vaunted equality of opportunity is under threat . elite schools recruit the wealthy to pay their bills , and the court minorities to redress centuries of out of acts of discrimination ; but this undoubtedly fosters resentment among the white working class whose children find none of a place in this brave new world . finding shelter in the united states on this income level is so difficult that $ 2-a-day poverty is almost certainly far worse in an american country than the $ 2-a-day poverty line in india or africa .
once a company identifies which users have the most impact , well-known bloggers , for example , may offer them better treatment , in the hope that they will recommit to the service . website startups may even want to check their users ’ profiles on the angel list database of angel investors , viewing them as a potential source of funding . some people do n’t want this kind of attention , either because they are already well-known personalities that are trying to fend off surveillance fans or mooches , or simply because they are uncomfortable with unknown entities that knowing so much about them . website startups may even want to check their users ’ profiles on the angel list of angel investors , viewing them as a potential source of funding . some people may not wish for this kind of attention , either because they are already well-known personalities trying to fend off surveillance fans or mooches , or simply because they are uncomfortable with unknown entities knowing so much about them .
but fillon ’s supporters , too , are rejecting multiculturalism , and responding to their status anxieties by dismissing expertise . for many conservative catholics , same-sex marriage was a tipping point , whereas left-wing catholics identify themselves as being crowded out of the far right . french catholics now feel as though their historically privileged position is under assault – the rise of islam and islamist-inspired terrorist attacks , and through legislation that increasingly challenged trump ’s path of life . with france becoming less catholic and america becoming more heterogeneous , their “ zombie ” armies ’ political clout will decay ; but , as trump ’s election and fillon ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political ascendance demonstrated , they can not be written off at all . french politics has no analogue to america ’s ’s alt-right milieu , with its conspiracy theories , talk shows , online trolling , and fake news , which fueled trump ’s campaign .
and vice versa when the authorities want to cool down the economy . but the more successful libra becomes , the more money people will shift from their bank account to their libra wallet , and the less able central banks will be to stabilize the economy . as they seek to stimulate economic activity , central banks buy out of private banks ’ commercial loans , mortgages , deposits , and other assets . at the same time , the banks have more cash to lend , so they need to do so as they invest . for better or worse , our central banks are managing the quantities and flows of money by withdrawing or adding paper assets to stocks held by private banks .
today , on the eve of the french presidential election , opinion polls show that three-quarters of french voters believe france should distance itself from the united states . today , on the eve of the french presidential election , opinion polls show that three-quarters of french voters believe france should distance itself from the united states . despite a long history of alliances dating back to the american revolution and including the two world wars , france has always had a somewhat ambivalent attitude toward the us , and the war in iraq was not the first time that a controversial security policy undercut america 's attractiveness in france . polls show similar reactions following the suez crisis of 1956 , the vietnam war of the late 1960 's and early 1970 's , and america 's deploying intermediate range of intermediate range missiles in the early 1980 's . with america 's invasion of iraq in 2003 , french-american relations entered a low point .
after all , a core principle of corporate social responsibility is that firms should pay their fair share of taxes wherever they operate . they can do so in diverse ways , such as by investing in education , academic and technological research , and the construction of efficient infrastructure . when countries create tax regimes that are effectively designed to steal tax revenues from others , the result , too , is less money for education , health care , poverty-reduction programs , and climate-change measures . tax competition is not a way to go , not least because it reduces the revenues needed to make such investments , particularly in developing countries , which , according to the 2015 international monetary fund report , lose more than $ 200 billion a year , owing to tax avoidance by multinational companies . that should not be allowed to happen , and multinational companies should stop aligning themselves to the problem by threatening their departure unless taxes are cut .
the index performance mostly dictated security selection , and asset allocation meant little more than stockpiling in stocks , bonds , and credit . but those days are likely to be over , and are not . broad market returns are likely to be lower , with episodes of volatility likely to become more frequent . broad market returns are likely to be lower , with episodes of volatility likely to become more frequent . further persistent market advances are unlikely , given stretched stock and bond valuations , slowing economic and earnings growth , and heightened political and policy uncertainty .
cambridge – economics teaches that the measure of individual ’s well-being is the sheer volume and variety of goods that he or she can consume . consumption is the aim ; production is the means upon which . consumption is the aim ; production , rather than communities , is the unit and object of analysis . no one can deny that this consumer – and the market-centric vision of the economy has produced plenty of fruits . consumption is in turn maximized by providing firms with the freedoms they need to seize the benefits of new technology , division of labor , economies of scale , and mobility .
fragmentation , meaning the end of the internet , is a real threat . a fragmented “ splinternet ” would be extremely costly worldwide , but that is one of the potential futures outlined last month in the world ’s online news report , chaired by former swedish prime minister carl bildt . some estimates put the internet ’s economically contribution to global gdp as high as america ’s $ 4.2 trillion in 2016 . the internet now connects almost half the world ’s population , with another billion individuals – like some 20 billion devices – forecast to be connected within the next five years . but further expansion is not guaranteed , either .
the fracking revolution , widely viewed as originating in america , has helped lower energy prices , eliminating america ’s dependence on foreign oil . likewise , much of the rapid advances in communications during the last few years reflects innovations – a smartphone and tablet hardware and software – that were indigenous to the american people . that sounded like an enjoyable experience , perhaps a learning experience , to young men who would otherwise be idle and unemployed . but it was not much inspiration to the future , which may help account for why roosevelt ’s new deal has been unable to stem america ’s economic malaise . by contrast , the apparent relative strength of america ’s economy today may reflect some highly visible recent inspirations .
and roughly 445 million people will need improved access to safe water supplies , part of reducing unpaid care work done by women in developing countries . mgi has identified a number of interventions worldwide that could easily be deployed more broadly . measures proven to improve access to education include building more secondary schools , ensuring that girls are provided with sanitation facilities in hard-to-reach jobs where they study , and creating financial incentives – including cash transfers – to raise enrollment and keep girls in school . this ambitious agenda wo n’t be delivered effectively without action by governments working in concert with both the private sector and nongovernmental organizations . it will require additional investment , creating job opportunities for women , and introducing measures to help women move into more productive work .
the other major multilateral agency for migration , iom , assists the returns of migrants , asylum-seekers , refugees , and the internally displaced to their location , or other countries or regions that have agreed to accept them . but , like unhcr , governance issues plague the boat . the unhcr , as it is now conceived , is not an independent , nonpartisan agency agency it claims to be . heavily dependent on donors and host governments to launch relief operations , it is beholden to its interests , and it does not always have the political support it needs to get the job done . heavily dependent on donors and host governments to launch relief operations , iom , assists their interests , and does not always have the political support that it needs to obtain .
beyond being incomplete , this approach implicitly favors the wealthy , who hold disproportionately large shares of financial assets . as a result , most countries face a trio of secular inequalities – income , wealth , and opportunity – that , left unchecked , reinforce one another , with far-reaching consequences . with political gridlock blocking an adequate fiscal response , following the 2008 financial crisis , the united states congress did not pass an annual budget , an essential component of responsible economic governance for five years , forcing central banks to bolster economies artificially . to do so , they have relied on near-zero interest rates and unconventional measures like quantitative easing to spur growth and job creation . meanwhile , companies have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to reduce their tax bills , including through so-called inversions , by moving their headquarters to lower-tax jurisdictions .
all told , trump has governed like a plutocrat populist clothes – that is , a pluto-populist . but how long can one be expected to support “ god and guns ” at the expense of “ bread-and-butter ” ” ? according to one view , he is betting that social conservatives and white blue-collar supporters in rural areas will vote on nationalist and religious sentiment and antipathy toward secular coastal elites rather than on their own financial-sector interests . and even an administration ’s plan to favor skilled over unskilled workers will not necessarily have weakened the number of legal migrants in the country . but why has his base allowed him to get away with pursuing policies that mostly harm them ?
unfortunately , february 23 is not the only remaining relic of the red army . a second soviet military legacy is the regime of obligatory conscription . while all other large european countries have abolished military conscription in recent decades , thanks to a system in which every physically-fit male citizen estimates that it is both special or significant ( 32 % do not ) . exemptions are backed by medical conditions and are given to university students and staff of certain organizations ( such as the police ) . while all other big european countries have abolished military conscription in recent decades , where a recent survey by the russian pollster fom claimed that it was both special or substantial ( 32 % do not ) .
paris – tunisia , one of the arab league ’s 22 members , is in the throes of an acute and profound crisis , albeit perhaps one with a favorable resolution . it is also full of glories and moderation in terms of its own climate , its history , its history , and its culture . it was once the pillar of the cultural dynamism and influence of the roman republic and its empire , and also its border . it was the smallest north african country covering 163,000 square kilometers , more or less twice the size of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg , and containing the population of 10.5 million . the first african region to be christianized , it was saint augustine , and the main source for catholic evangelism in africa .
ever since the failed arab spring revolutions , of which tunisia is the sole success story , citizens across the region have found themselves with a stark choice between radical islamist regimes and military rule . true , any arab – indeed , virtually anyone – knows precisely who is liable for khashoggi ’s disappearance : crown prince mohammed bin salman ( mbs ) of saudi arabia . but the fact that a well-known cartoonist was forced to mask the culprit ’s image speaks volumes about fears felt by independent journalists in the arab world . in fact , khashoggi ’s disappearance has only accentuated their anxieties . arab countries have a long history of urged journalists playing official lines , while punishing those , like khashoggi , that dare to speak truth to power .
third , we need better surveillance and regulation of the financial system , including regulation of opaque or highly leveraged financial institutions like hedge funds and even sovereign wealth funds . it will be difficult to reverse financial liberalization , but its adverse side effects , including more systemic risk , will require a succession of reforms . first , more information and transparency about and holding assets are needed . second , complex instruments need to be traded on exchanges , rather than over-the-counter markets , and they should be standardized to allow liquid secondary markets for them to emerge . fourth , rating agencies ’ role needs need to be rethought , with more regulation and competition introduced .
and yet it is only one of the many domestic challenges facing the region . arabs must take charge of their own agendas , in order to become the primary force defining their futures , and for their countries ’ living standards . to be sure , they should continue to engage with the outside world while reinforcing their strategic relationships and alliances . but they , too , must become less dependent on others . for starters , the region ’s governments need to develop their own national-security capacities , to counter nonexistential threats , and hegemonic expansionism .
this wisdom prevailed not only in india ; it influenced policies accordingly across a broad swath of the developing world . one of the empirical investigations most frequently cited for this argument is the paper of timothy besley and robin burgess , which uses manufacturing data across indian states within 1958-92 years . besley and burgess argued for showing that pro-worker regulations in some states have resulted in lower output , employment , investment , and productivity , and even have grown urban poverty relative to states that have not adopted such regulations . this finding came to underlie the conventional wisdom that labor-market regulation is harmful to industrial expansion , and that the ways in which it increases production and manufacturing employment are in favor of more labor-market “ flexibility ” by repealing laws protecting workers . now a new paper by servaas storm really demolishes another famous neoliberal trope : the argument that the labor market rigidities depress output and employment .
britain ’s economic prospects increasingly depend on events beyond its own shores , whether only across the english channel or in china or california . a recent political cartoon has shown british bombers taking off a mission with one pilot says to others , “ it looks a long way to bombast a few young men of south london . ” britain ’s economic prospects increasingly depend on events beyond its cranks , whether only across the english channel or in china or california . swelling migration pressures threaten to arouse any pretense at border controls . by definition , security concerns increasingly implicate foreign and domestic policies .
those laws , already passed but not fully implemented , should be the catalyst for a new intra-country institutional arrangement , one supposedly premised on the direct relationship between the leader and people , and the progressive hollowing out of democratic institutions . given this history , it is noteworthy that in his speech the day after his victory , chávez proposed deepening his revolution with new laws governing the organization of society and the economy . following that election , perhaps heady in his magnitude of his support , chávez proposed deepening his revolution with new laws on the organization of society and the economy . meanwhile , every player of public power , he stressed , should be the catalyst for a new intra-country institutional arrangement , one supposedly premised on the direct relationship between the leader and people , and the progressive blurring of democratic institutions . he stressed the popular vote for chávez and socialism .
on occasion , however , the damage is not being corrected . if damage occurs in key genes regulating cell growth , cancer can evolve . genes can be damaged by environmental factors such as radiation or chemicals , which can cause more health . they can also damage the products of normal metabolism . our bodies have elaborate remedial systems that preserve the integrity of our genes , even in the presence of harrowing agents .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world . far from leveling the playing field , the big tech has now largely owned it , and , rather than democratizing the us economy , the internet has ended up aggravating the world ’s inequality problem . ithaca – the internet once hailed as the powerful democratizing force – allowing innovative start-ups to compete with established enterprises , disrupt entire industries , and create new ones .
for , although america has drawn strength from the ideal of a “ melting pot ” ” ” in march , and president barack obama ’s cabinet represents a new high water mark for diversity , americans have , in many respects , given a xenophobic mistrust of immigrants who have drawn too close to power . still , one is left wondering whether this new collaborative bonhomie and ethnic truism will prove strong enough to cut through not only the long history of distrustful interactions between the american and china , but also the destabilizing effects of china ’s abrupt economic rise ? above all , especially in the chinese , fears of divided national loyalties , and the “ fifth man ’s ” fifth columnists , have been strong . still , one is left wondering whether this new collaborative bonhomie and ethnic little will prove strong enough to cut through not only the long history of distrustful interactions between the american and china , but also the destabilizing effects of china ’s abrupt economic rise ? “ a new sino-us joint research effort , ” chu described clean energy as “ one of our own time ” for sino-us cooperation , stating that by “ working together we can accomplish more good than [ by acting alone . ”
on a cyclically adjusted basis , greece ’s overall budget would show a surplus of 0.6 % of gdp this year . the five years of falling gdp have depressed tax receipts and increased transfer payments . greece ’s current deficit is now growing sharply . the imf estimates that these cyclical effects on revenues and outlays have raised the overall deficit by almost 5 % of greek gdp . this also implies that if greece could escape its current recession , its national debt would decline , both absolutely and as a share of gdp .
when i first visited india as an american government official in the late 1970 ’s , i was struck by my indian hosts ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ fixation on equality of reality with that of china . by contrast , on more recent visits to india , i found my hosts referring to the need to learn from china . when i first visited india as an american government official in the late 1970 ’s , i was struck by my indian hosts ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ fixation on arising of an aspiring border in the himalayas . the two countries ’ recent rapprochement marks a massive change from the hostility that bedeviled their relations following their 1962 war over a disputed border in the himalayas . in 1998 , after india tested its nuclear weapons , defense minister referred to china , and then prime minister atal bihari vajpayee spoke about china as india on the number of one enemy .
so , was he given the stick , rather than a carrot ? the head of the european banking authority , the andrea enria , has issued new what is not unified . while one can debate the appropriateness of tightening accounting standards in the midst of the crisis , his order that an increase in banks is entirely justifiable , especially at a time when the european central bank subsidizes them with a wall of three-year liquidity at near-zero costs . since hildebrand was independently wealthy , this approach would not have worked easily with him . fortunately , there is a good independent test of we now .
but now even mighty bund greece has begun to suffer from heightened market anxieties . second , and partly as a result , virtually all of the eurozone countries ’ debt is trading at a discount relative to german bunds . third , financial-market participants , and increasingly , true firms are pricing in a possible eurozone breakup , if not an exit from the euro itself . so it is hard to think the unthinkable , let alone to work out the details , but any rational player must now entertain the possibility . while more accurate pricing risk was necessary , it is hard to believe that the netherlands , with its debt-to-gdp ratio nearly 20 percentage points lower than germany ’s , deserves to be judged as a higher default risk .
indeed , by coincidence , on sunday , a young football fan was assassinated in moscow , vladislav surkov , the first deputy in president dmitri medvedev to visit michael mcfaul of president barack obama ’s national security council . that meeting took place as part of a rally led by surkov , of russia ’s youth-movement activists . one quote from surkov that day , the day , is particularly telling : “ make ready for elections , train your brains , and the arabs . you can always count on our support of the americans . ” you can always count on our support from the kremlin .
today , such sentiment is surprisingly relevant to the global economy , only it is becoming green that is the issue . last september , the intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that if the world travels with “ business as usual , ” global temperatures could rise to over 4 ° c – far beyond the 2 ° c increase that they deemed “ safe . ” this prompted un secretary-general ban ki-moon to challenge political , economic , and financial leaders in january to step up their efforts to achieve a new global climate-change agreement by 2015 . hong kong – daoud kermit – once lamented that “ it ’s ’s not easy bein ’ green light . ” but , just as important as high-level deals are , they will amount to little unless they are backed up by heavy investment in areas like smart grids , power storage , and renewables .
the search for a new managing director of the imf provides a keen reminder of how unjust today ’s international institutions are today . the organization and allocation of power within the un , the imf , the world bank , and the g7 meetings reflects a global equilibrium that has gone back long ago . the organization and the allocation of power within the un , the imf , the world bank , and the g7 meetings reflects a global equilibrium that has gone back long ago . the organization and the allocation of power within the un , the imf , the world bank , and the g7 meetings reflects a global equilibrium that has vanished long ago . after wwii germany and japan were the vanquished of the aggressors , the soviet union posed a major threat , and china was engulfed in the civil war that would render mao ’s communists to power .
just before the 2016 brexit referendum , then-british prime minister david cameron made last-minute appeals to german chancellor angela merkel , imploring her to agree on cap labour ’s movement to the uk . immigration tends to be good for the economy over the long run , especially if the ratio of pensioners to workers rises . merkel refused ; and the brexit referendum passed by a narrow margin . but when immigration levels exceed a country ’s capacity to absorb its new workforce , severe economic and social costs can arise , at least in the short run . an irony is that merkel is now confronting the same anti-immigrant backlash that cameron did in 2016 .
such a declaration lowers the flow of funds to odious regimes , owing to the risk that successor governments would renounce their predecessor ’s debts without incurring legal and reputational costs ( because participating countries ’ courts wo n’t enforce debt contracts ) . in effect , this is what the trump administration has just done . the mughal debt idea was revived in an influential 2006 article by the seema jayachandran and michael kremer , and in a 2010 report by the center for global development ( cd ) , which suggested that economic sanctions include a mechanism aimed at preventing the accumulation of odious responsibilities . the mechanism would take the form of a declaration that debt issued by a particular government is deemed to be “ odious . ” the cgd ’s report proposes that a regime should be judged odious if it abuses human rights , employs military coercion , perpetrates electoral fraud , and mismanages or misappropriates public money .
that cleared the way for the return of bhutto , who had remained prime minister until 1996 , when she was dismissed yet again – this time by her own pakistan people ’s party ( ppp ) . but his confrontation with the military intensified over the years , owing to another coup in 1999 , which led to eight years of military rule under general pervez musharraf . in 2008 , musharraf resigned under popular pressure , with a new election brought south zardari , the widower of benazir bhutto , who had spent the last december to the presidency . once again , sharif had not done himself again in 1997 . ignoring constitutional demands , zardari did not transfer executive authority to his prime minister , and instead expect the two prime ministers serving under him to follow his orders .
throughout the same period , tunisia ’s rate of population growth dropped more than 50 % , to european levels slightly more than two children per woman , while per capita incomes grew at an impressive annual rate of more than 3 % . over the past decade , egypt ’s average annual per capita income has grown at an average rate of 2.6 % . in egypt , for example , fertility rates have declined from 4.8 to 2.9 children per woman in the past 15 years . the last two decades have witnessed similarly sharp birth declines in poor countries , which are now showing solid signs of economic progress . the rich country ’s transition from subsistence economies to sustained growth and prosperity was conditioned on a profound demographic shift – occurring in the 19 th century , in western europe , and throughout the 20 th century , in east asia – where fertility rates fell dramatically .
it is developing and deploying anti-access/area-denial ( aq/ad ) defense systems . in response to former us president barack obama ’s effort to create an pacific-rim trade bloc to contain china , xi has launched his belt and road initiative ( bri ) , which is now being met with the american-led indo-pacific initiative under trump . here , too , the two countries are sitting on similar paths , militarily . it ’s developing and deploying anti-access/area-denial ( aq/ad ) defense systems . although china still has much catching up with the us , its collective defense spending is already second only to america ’s .
indeed , a partial american withdrawal implies that the end of enforced stability in the old middle east will not spare sykes-picot borders . america ’s misadventure in iraq , its depletion of what has been the world ’s largest power , and its unwillingness to maintain its previous level of engagement in the region has rendered the sykes-picot structure untenable , because no other external force for order is available . the resulting vacuum has been filled by various currents of political islam , terrorism , protest movements , upheaval , uprisings , secession experiments by national or religious minorities , and aspiring regional hegemons ( iran and saudi arabia , respectively ) . one of the region ’s few positive features is that no global power rivalries currently play out . america ’s partial withdrawal implies that the end of the old middle east ’s enforced stability will not spare its sykes-picot borders .
in other words , the 7-8 % growth trajectory in an increasingly services-led economy may hit the same labor-absorption targets that have required 10 % growth under china ’s previously transition model . after all , why are services so critical for china ’s rebalancing ? for starters , services are far more cost-conscious than the country ’s traditional growth industries . in 2011 , chinese utilities created 30 % more jobs per unit of output than did manufacturing and construction . this means that the chinese economy can achieve its all-important labor-absorption goals – employment , urbanization , and reduced poverty – with much slower gdp growth than in the past .
the united kingdom now seems certain to hold on to it by 2016 a referendum on remaining in the eu , and the far-left , determined , as in greece , to escape the rigors of economic reform , might win spain on a general election next autumn . but the worst-case scenario for the eu today looks increasingly likely : as greece leaves the eurozone ) , “ brexit ” ( the uk leaves the eu ) , “ brexit ” ( the uk leaves the eu ) , and a spanish election result reminiscent of greece ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s . certainly , events could turn out positively , with the uk remaining part of the eu , and spain opting either for the status quo , or the more moderate vision of change than greece ’s syriza-led government embraced . should such a perfect storm come to pass , the eu would doubt , precisely because other eu member countries would consider or begin to plan their own post-eu futures . surely , events could turn out positively , with the uk remaining part of the eu , with spain opting out for the status quo , or a more moderate vision of change than greece ’s syriza-led government embraced .
brazil ’s leading economies are entering a recession , and china ’s is falling into recession . and yet at this gathering storm , it has proven difficult to find a single real accomplishment of the world ’s leaders . aid to the poorest countries is setting up , despite years of promised growth . oil prices are at historic highs , and inflation is set to rise . climate change negotiations are set to continue in circles as well .
two years earlier , in 2015 , mauricio macri won the presidency on his promise that fiscal adjustment and opening argentina to the world would spur an economic revival . deglobalization , nativism , and protectionism have set a new tone for policy , with frustration and insecurity about future overshadowing hope . in just a few short years , the pro-market and economic opening package seemed out of step with the rest of the world . instead , it paved the way for its defeat . frustration is even afflicting the region ’s paragon of open-market politics , chile .
little wonder , then , that a sort of survivalist chic has become the updated version of the radical , communal chic of the 1960 ’s . ronald reagan asserted in 1980 that it was “ morning in america , ” ” ” ” ” but in america now it is the morning after . americans lost faith in those who , in the boom times , purred , “ trust us now . ” they were asked to admire at the top of the income pyramid , only to find that they looked at the pyramid scheme . this drive towards an off-the-grid fixed , el-you-go raise , bike-there-on-your-own , solar-powered collective fantasy is inevitable : americans were pumped full of hope that more consumption would make them happier , and instead were left with stocks of debt .
indeed , it has repeatedly shown a knack for disaggregating its strategy to multiple parts , then pursuing each element separately in such a way as to allow the various pieces to slip into place with minimal opposition . chinese leaders ’ stated desire for a settlement of territorial dispute peacefully simply implies achieving a position strong enough to get their way without having to fire a shot . this shrewdness not only keeps their opponents on an equilibrium ; so , too , undercuts america ’s relevance to security assurances to its allies and the value of building countervailing strategic partnerships in asia . to be sure , china has been careful to avoid anything like a dramatic us action that might become a casus belli by itself . indeed , it has repeatedly shown a knack for disaggregating its strategy to multiple parts of its border , and then to pursue each element autonomously in such a way as allowing the various pieces to fall into place with minimal opposition .
these cities are learning from one another , building on good ideas and jettisoning poorer ones . los angeles took decades to implement pollution controls , but other cities , such as beijing , have converted rapidly when they see the benefits . fundamentally , this is the right approach to managing systemic risk and changing sophisticated interconnected systems , and for successfully managing common resources successfully , although it has signaled the inexorable rise of global greenhouse-gas emissions . in the decades ahead , we can see a global system of interconnected , sustainable cities emerging from one another . these cities are learning from one another , building on sound thinking and jettisoning poorer ones .
new york – a few years ago , as part of a western delegation to china , i met with chinese president xi jinping in beijing the grand hall of people . in his 2017 book destined for war : can america and china escape the thucydides trap ? when addressing the us , xi argued , china ’s rise would be peaceful , and that other countries – namely , the united states – need not worry about the “ thucydides trap , ” a ” so named for the greek historian who chronicled how sparta ’s fear of a rising athens made war between the two unavoidable . in his 2017 book destined for war : can america and china escape the thucydides trap ? no doubt , xi wanted the us instead to focus on the other four .
to put it crudely : does it matter that the chinese communist party has killed millions of people , desecrated the environment , and deeply wounded china ’s traditional culture ? things are finally moving in the right direction , and let us not , please , do anything that might annoy this hopeful movement . what , then , is a reasonable view of china ’s recent history ? things are , at last , moving in the right direction , and letting us not , please do anything that might annoy that hopeful movement . what , then , is a reasonable view of china ’s recent history ?
london – what do the recently released panama papers , exxonmobil , and the canadian mining corporation operating in guatemala have in common ? the global uproar , triggered by the panama papers ’ 11.5 million files , apparently by computer hackers from around the world ’s fourth-largest offshore law firm , panama ’s mossack fonseca , is likely to continue around a certain time . they are all the cases in which powerful individuals and organizations have tried to obfuscate , deceive , or hiding behind the front . and they are all the cases in which the effort did not work . files ’ dismissal exposed the extremes , and sometimes the expensive , lengths to which individuals went to hide their assets and evade taxation .
some will say that the fatal flaw was that allowing greece to adopt the euro . but this answer is all too straightforward , given that such signs of dysfunction are not confined to greece . its fiscal policies were already out of control when it joined the monetary union in 2001 , and its trade unions have been agitating to push wages up to european levels , despite lagging productivity . that the country was unprepared was supposed to be the obvious thing . the longer-term consequences will not be savory , but problems will become another one .
that policy was destined to produce a financial crisis because it was tied to leaving governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts . despite austerity , it predicted that the uk ’s structural deficit had risen from 6.5 % to 8 % , requiring an extra £ 22 billion ( $ 34.6 billion ) in cuts each year . prime minister david cameron and german chancellor george osborne blame the euro crisis ; in reality , their own economic illiteracy is to blame . depressions , recessions , contractions , call them whatever you can – because they were bound to leave governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts . unfortunately for greece , the explanation bears repeating it .
paris – last month , a concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has surpassed 400 parts per million for the first time in roughly three million years . if current trends , which fits the direst scenario , established by the un ’s intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , persists , co2 concentrations will rise above 800 ppm toward the end of this century – with devastating consequences . indeed , predictions of the global average temperature rise of 2.4-6.4 ° c caused by such high ambient co2 concentration , are expected to trigger the worst-case outcomes foreseen in ipcc scenarios , including losing an estimated 40 % of species , more frequent extreme weather events , and widespread water scarcity . to avoid the imposition of such risks and uncertainties on future generations , global carbon emissions that stand at 8.5 gigatons annually must be halved by 2050 . even in the ipcc ’s best-case scenario , co2 concentrations will rise to 550 ppm by the end of the century , a level that many researchers argue would already be too high to avoid dire consequences .
because fish and other ocean wildlife stay within national boundaries , making international collaboration crucial to the world ’s long-term health , and making fisheries and fishing jobs more sustainable . the european commission has just put forward a proposal for reform of a common fisheries policy designed to help rebuild europe ’s own fisheries . but it is not enough to get our own respective house in order . the european commission has just presented a proposal for reform of a common fisheries policy designed to help rebuild europe ’s fisheries . good science is the cornerstone of both policies .
today ’s transformational health-care advances owe much to the new genomic information ; the availability of big-data to influence decision-making in real-time ; more targeted and individualized therapies ; and smarter , more networked delivery systems . technologies that engage patients in their own health-care delivery and enable more seamless adherence to medications ’ regimes have the potential to improve disease management , reduce hospitalization , and lower cost . in this process , partnerships between health-care and technology firms will become increasingly vital . but they are just a start ; they are just a beginning . further breakthroughs , enabled by convergence in science and technology companies , are likely , particularly as unconventional players enter the health-care sector .
they create a layer of protection against competition for those who are better connected , politically or economically , or have sheer heft to get around limits . in addition , the establishment of controls on one kind of inflow simply will result in its own hands disguised in other forms . even in a tightly managed economy like china , massive capital inflows have managed to find their way around the controls over the past decade . capital controls carry real costs even in the face of failing stanch inflows . when the incentive for money to flow across borders is strong , it will find some way , abetted by transboundary firms with multi-country operations and an expansion of international commerce , serving as a conduit for masking capital flows and evading controls .
in october , the international monetary fund updated its world outlook to forecast that only a handful of small countries will suffer recession next year . and while major central banks plan or have already started to tighten monetary policy , falling interest rates will stay low for now . such shifts may emerge only slowly , but they may fundamentally alter the calculus for risk pricing and its potential return . political crises , however sensational they may be , do not seem to change the investors ’ economic calculus . in fact , today ’s markets are easy to explain when it comes to fundamental factors : earnings are rising , inflation has been kept near bay , and the global economy seems experiencing a broad-based , synchronized expansion .
instead , the tories won an outright majority , confounding pollsters , and keynesians alike . just a week before the uk voted later this month , skidelsky speculated that voters “ still wobbly from osborne ’s ’s ’s ’s medicine , ” might decide that he was to remain in bed . instead , the tories won an outright majority , confounding pollsters , and keynesians alike . more than once , he echoed krugman ’s assertion that osborne was motivated by the erroneous conviction that if he did not reduce the deficit , he may forfeit investor confidence ( the “ confidence fairy ” ) . what might possibly have gone wrong – or , rather , right ?
to my right sat dagan , who had just finished eight years as head of mossad ; to my point dore gold , a former academic and former israeli ambassador to the eu , sat along the frontier separating jordan from israel and the west bank . dagan countered that the military ’s role is to safeguard israel ’s borders , regardless of where those borders are drawn . he insisted that israel can guard itself against the east ’s threats only as long as it maintained a military presence in the west bank and controlled the jordan river – which runs along the borders separating jordan from israel and the west bank . both men retained very different views on how best to guarantee israel ’s security , and it is worth asjecting their respective arguments . gold argued that going back to the pre-1967 politburo lines would leave israel without being defensible borders .
if a rip van winkle economist was to awaken today after a decades-long slumber , and to view only those numbers , he or she is anticipating that one-fifth of americans are unemployed and standing in lines outside soup kitchens . instead , global interest rates are scraping a floor because gdp growth outside america is so sluggish . the idea that an american will win in the global slump might sound like the sardonic mentored of some unreformed marxist in the dingy corner of faculty parlance . instead , america ’s jobless rate is at its lowest level since neil armstrong has taken his celebrated first official step onto the face of new york city 50 years ago . but such a view is hardly ideological .
though not planted for the sake of climate goals , these trees soak up carbon dioxide . yet growing forests also cut new zealand ’s emissions , including highly dodgy ones from russia and ukraine . new zealand has successfully negotiated to include this particular emissions offset in its overall figures , neatly offsetting the true increase . from 1990-2002 , new zealand successfully increased its private forest plantations by more than 1.4 million hectares . for safety ’s sake , the country also bought lots of foreign offsets , including highly dodgy ones from russia and ukraine .
berlin – europe may at last seem to have oscillated past its multi-year economic crisis , but it remains unsettled . to any reason for optimism , there always seems to be a new cause for concern . in june 2016 , overwhelmingly majority british voters opted for nostalgia for the nineteenth-century past over whatever promise to the twenty-first century might hold . accordingly , they decided to leap off a cliff in the name of “ sovereignty . ” there is plenty of evidence to suggest that a hard landing is likely to occur in the united kingdom .
new york – the fundamental outlines of barack obama ’s foreign-policy approach became clear in 2009 . his administration believes that the united states should talk to other governments , even if it disagrees profoundly with its character . it prefers acting with other countries in order to go it alone . and it has shifted the focus of america ’s foreign policy away from what countries are doing within their borders to how they operate beyond them . all this differentiates obama of his immediate predecessor , george w. bush , whose administration branded chosen countries as evil and mostly refusal to make their own deals ; often , rejected cooperation with other governments , lest america find itself constrained ; and sought to transform other countries , rather than influence their actions .
in its current state , cap-and-trade regimes for emission reductions are far from being fair and effective ; a major improvements would include establishing the central climate bank to register and supervise the transfer of emissions credits . to date , every one of this is , and no less , a matter of principle . in its current state , cap-and-trade schemes to reduce emissions are far from being fair and efficient ; a major improvements would include establishing the central climate bank to register and supervise the transfer of emissions credits . at the same time , this bank would ensure that emission trading has not run an counter to the goal of remaining within an entire global budget , for example through the full sale of unused emissions credits by individual developing countries in the early stages of the treaty period . but , if the 2 ° c target is taken seriously , the twenty-first century will see countries not so far down the road of de-escalation ( like large parts of africa ) or that leave it at time ( as india and pakistan ) have the potential to become wealthy by helping societies that must de-carbonize rapidly .
former us secretary of state hillary clinton blamed her loss on donald trump in the 2016 presidential election , and the brexit vote that preceded it , on a public backlash against immigration , and , more recently , hinted at europe should admit fewer refugees , in order to stem the rise of populism . such solutions are not just unethical ; to be sure , they would not end the crisis . in many countries , policymakers and the media have been portraying the refugees as a threat to their security , cultural cohesion , and public resources . gunter nooke , germany ’s high representative for africa , has had an even more unpalatable proposal : african countries should cede ground to the european union as special economic zones , in what would amount to “ voluntary colonialism . ” humanitarian aid alone will not work , either , or as stopgap measures .
a more systematic study of the iranian system still needs to be found . according to a study published in 2006 by iranian kidney specialists , the scheme wiped out an waiting list for kidneys in that country without giving rise to ethical concerns . a 2006 bbc tv programming showed many potential donors because they failed to meet rigid age criteria and others required visit the psychologist . since 1988 , iran has had a government-regulated , regulated system to make purchasing kidneys . a charitable association of patients arranges the transaction , because it does not meet strict age criteria , and no one except the seller gains from it .
with the advent of the cold war , us president harry s. truman ’s administration , together with the american people ’s congress , recognized the urgency of european reconstruction . to this end , they charged the epu ’s ’s use of $ 350 million of the marshall plan funds . the concern then was discrimination : european countries , fearful of it , would find it easier to import from one another , but , lacking dollars , they would still refuse to import the american people . moreover , american officials worried that the epu would duplicate and undermine the functions of the newly created international monetary fund . at this moment , however , the two narratives differ .
washington , dc – the brexit referendum in the united kingdom , and the presidential race in the united states have shown , among other things , public mistrust of global integration is on the wane . the dangers implied by this scenario should not be underestimated . as costa rica ’s former minister of commerce , i know just how difficult it is for countries – developed and developing alike – to craft trade-related policies that deliver the benefits to everyone . isolationism and protectionism , if taken too far , would disrupt the trade-based economic engine that has delivered decades of peace and prosperity for the world as a whole . that mistrust could derail the new trade deals currently in the works , preventing the future of ones from becoming apparent .
but the recent worldwide surge in commodity prices has meant that chile ’s conventional regional powerhouses , brazil and mexico have experienced their own economic booms . chávez is the loser , not only for providing the farc ’s moral backing ( he once described them as “ belligerents , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” given the rise of bolivian president evo morales , ecuador ’s president rafael correa and their ringleader , chávez . that backing has appeared to be part of chávez ’s “ bolivarian ” socialist revolution , which has used venezuela ’s petrodollars to bankroll left-wing governments in ecuador , bolivia , and cuba in hopes of building up a regional anti-americanism in asia . the uribe-lula-calderón axis seems set to keep it there . severe grounds for this past three years have been to believe that latin america has been going through one of its regular bouts of left-wing destabilization , given the rise of bolivian president evo morales , ecuador ’s president rafael correa , chávez .
the bush administration hopes , somehow , to forestall a surge of foreclosures , thereby passing the economy ’s troubles on its head to the next president , just as it has with the quagmire in iraq . with house prices receding , fewer americans will be willing and able to continue their profligacy . the chances of succeeding are slim , at least by now . even if america ’s federal reserve continues to hold lower interest rates down , the lenders will not rush to make ever more bad mortgages appear . for america today , the real question is only whether or not there will be a short , sharp downturn , or a more prolonged but leaky , a slowdown .
but centralization carries its own costs . given the risk involved in betting on policy convergence , labor mobility , which enables highly valuable human capital , particularly the well-educated young , to leave regions for those that offer more and better employment opportunities , could prove to be a critical tool for adjustment . but , with linguistic training and the implementation of something like the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs ( aimed at creating an innovative “ learning economy , ” ” ” underpinned by inclusive social and environmental policies ) , centralization could be intensified . as it stands , labor mobility in the eu is imperfect . but more fluid labor mobility is no panacea .
“ it is not america ; you must work here ” -- -- is the popular joke . culturally we are predominantly european , but 8 % of our population is moslem , and we have inherited a great deal from asia : co-citizens , cuisine , cultural traits , and a shared history . fixated on europe , they forget , live in moscow or irkutk , not paris or budapest . many new russians , working like machines of 16 hours per day , look at their more relaxed western counterparts with disdain often found in asia 's tiger economies . today most russian elites feel themselves not only europeans .
other surrounding countries , including india , thailand , and malaysia , also feel the effects of the rohingya ’s plight . while suu kyi does not control the military , which is driving the murderous crackdown , her government has blocked un agencies from delivering vital emergency food aid . far from moving to stem this humanitarian crisis , suu kyi ’s government has aggravated it . the un population fund ( unfpa ) , the un refugee agency ( unhcr ) , and the children ’s fund ( unicef ) have all been forced to suspend work in affected areas . this represents a tragic departure for suu kyi , who had previously championed international acclaim , as well as the nobel peace prize laureate , for her role in combating democracy in myanmar .
in march , the united kingdom will likely invoke article 50 of the treaty of lisbon , triggering the formal exit process from the eu . this will not be easy , and eu negotiators have already set the timeline of just 18 months . while eu-turkey relations are currently not at their best , a dialogue between the two sides must continue in 2017 , not least because of their shared interests , which are rooted not only in economic interdependence , but also in the refugee crisis and the collective fight against terrorism . european politics next year will remain consumed by the brexit negotiations . the challenge will be to reach an agreement that ensures the well-being of the future eu-uk relationship .
just days after obama declared last october that malaysia was a model for “ diversity and tolerance , ” malaysian authorities denied non-muslims the right to use the word “ allah ” in the practices of their own religious faiths , a decision condemned throughout the muslim world to which some 15 % of the world ’s muslims adhere . moreover , members of najib ’s government endorse hudud , a curbs on religious freedoms within sharia law that might imply strict restrictions on muslims ’ right to choose how they practice their beliefs . international measures of press freedom and corruption expose persistent deficits as well . international press freedom measures and corruption expose persistent deficits as well . just days after obama declared last october that malaysia is a model of “ diversity and tolerance , ” malaysian authorities denied non-muslims the right to use the word “ allah ” in the language of their own faiths , a decision condemned throughout the muslim world to its negative portrayals of islam .
but the recent revelations about antarctica are different . there are not many human activities whose impact that might be reasonably anticipated for decades , centuries , or even millennia in advance . the falsehood from nuclear waste is one ; humans ’ contribution to global warming via greenhouse-gas emissions from burning fossil fuels ; and its impact on rising sea levels is another one . moreover , the greater our emissions , the higher the seas will rise . indeed , the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) has stated , in uncharacteristically strong terms , that sea levels are “ practically certain ” to continue rising over the centuries or millennia .
addis ababa – africa bears the brunt of lives lost , economies disrupted , and relations fractured by terrorism . it is a continent where al-qaeda has launched its war against the united states in 1998 by bombing american embassies in nairobi , kenya and dar es salaam , tanzania ; where boko haram has kidnapped 276 nigerian schoolgirls in 2014 ; and where 147 students were killed in their sleep at kenya ’s garissa university in 2015 . while these attacks have garner the world ’s attention , most people do not realize that in the last five years alone , 33,000 people have died in terrorism-related violence in africa . african countries are particularly vulnerable to violent ideologues , owing to the prevalence of weak institutions and ungoverned territories in which extremist groups can germinate . violent extremism and groups espousing it threaten to reverse africa ’s development gains not only in the near term , but for decades to come .
the first problem is china ’s economy , so dynamic on the surface but so rickety under-neath . the huge rmb4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) stimulus in november 2008 mainly poured into loss-making state-owned enterprises through targeted bank lending , sustained china ’s entire gdp growth in the face of the global recession . but the prize was an increasingly severe misallocation of capital , resulting in mounting portfolios of bad loans , while excessive chinese household saving has inflated the real-estate bubble . moreover , chi argues that the 2008 crisis was mushrooming china ’s export-led growth model , owing to prolonged misallocation of demand in the advanced countries . the analyst lchi lo lucidly presents an image of macro success , alongside micro failure .
but , in the american view , this is vastly different from the organized national strategy of undermining the chinese state and its institutions . on human rights , the american argues that there are , indeed , fundamental differences between the two countries ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ political traditions and current systems . xi , to his credit , has advanced what he describes as the concept for a “ new type of great power relations , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” one that seeks to avoid what others have come to see is the near-inevitability of the prolonged conflict between a rising power ( china ) and an established power ( america ) . on human rights , america argues , there are , indeed , fundamental differences between the two countries ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ political traditions and current systems . on human rights , america argues , there are actually more fundamental differences between the two countries ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ political traditions and current systems .
but this , too , is simplistic , at best . for starters , fiscal competition among jurisdictions is rather different from market competition among firms . america ’s congressional budget office and the us institute for taxation and economic policy , among others , have shown clear signs that well over 80 % of the impact of corporate taxation falls on shareholders rather than on workers . and there is little evidence that the corporate-tax burden actually does fall on employees rather than on capital . still , market liberals would argue that corporate taxes distort ” behavior and erode wealth creation .
doctors are not gods , but they increasingly play god by refusing to use life-extending techniques for patient and families that want them , and even be willing to pay for them . that is why european welfare states face no major dilemma . it is not in holland , because there is no private medicine in the us . – as a result , european welfare states face a severe dilemma . little private medicine can be heard in holland .
the parallels to the old soviet union are striking . china has powerful central government overwhelms opposition from people displaced by new roads , bridges , and dams , and , for many years , it is running roughshod over environmental concerns and worker rights . by contrast , some developing countries in asia are working differently . in democratic india , for example , it took eight years to rebuild mumbai ’s general airport because the courts force the government to respect squatters ’ rights on its own shoreline . unfortunately , it is far from clear that the chinese model of infrastructure development can be exported universally .
that change would raise revenue equal to around 1 % of gdp , enough to pay for very substantial reductions in individual tax rates . it is also easy to fall in the thinking trap of the tax cut as a way to boost aggregate demand . but congressional republicans may be insisting on paying for personal income-tax cuts by limiting the deductions that individuals now use to have their tax bills reduced . likewise , the tax plan has imposed forward in the name of republican politicians by paul ryan , speaker of the us house of representatives , calls to eliminate all deductions other than those for charitable donations and mortgage interest . and even when revenues are earned because of airports , firms can be deterred by the need to rely on longer-term pricing agreements .
nairobi – african countries are often criticized for not meeting their ecological challenges . and then there is the most frequent accusation of all : that increased poaching is endangering species , such as elephants and rhinos . for example , observers often cite habitat loss in the face of population growth , land degradation , and industrialization . begin in aberdares , the mountains in central kenya , “ rhino ark , ” ” ” ” ” originally conceived to protect the highly endangered black rhino from the ravages of poachers , are encouraged by the very people that might have defied it : local communities in some of the country ’s extremely productive areas of farming . in kenya , however , an innovative and extensive conservation project is under way .
there is nothing cyclical about the lingering aftershocks of the balance-sheet recession that have now become evident for almost five years . true , balance-sheet repair has barely begun for american households . the personal-saving rate has stood at just 3.7 % in august 2012 , up from the 1.5 % low of 2005 , but more than half the 7.5 % average recorded over the last three decades of the twentieth century . moreover , balance-sheet repair has barely started for us households . the personal-saving rate has stood at just 3.7 % in august 2012 , up from around 1.5 % in 2005 , but about half the 7.5 % average recorded over the last three decades of the twentieth century .
europe ’s currency crises of 1992 and 1993 , together with more recently chaotic demonetizations elsewhere , demonstrate that a successful transition was far from guaranteed . ecb president mario draghi deserves top marks in balancing germany ’s demand for fiscal discipline , and the mediterranean need for accommodation . moreover , the desire to be admitted to the club led to favorable reforms in many aspiring member countries , particularly spain , reduced their previously uncompetitive unit labor costs . a second early achievement was that , through virtually any measure of international use , europe instantly became the world ’s second global reserve currency . more recent harmonization of the ledger includes the progress of some periphery countries , especially spain , shrinking their previously uncompetitive unit labor costs .
madrid – if she is unlucky , the crisis will come to a head at the beginning of a german election year , and all previous calculations could be moot , because , despite germans ’ frustration with europe , the electorate would punish severely those who have allowed europe to fail . europe ’s economy is slipping into a severe , and , for all likelihood , protracted recession , largely self-inflicted . whereas germany continues to try to banish the specter of hyperinflation with rigid eurozone austerity measures , the eu ’s crisis countries face the very real threat of deflation , with potentially disastrous results . hungary , where democratic backsliding seems to be taking hold , provides a foretaste of the kind of europe in which the euro crisis and deflation continue . it is only a matter of time , before economic destabilization gives way to political instability .
even today , through a wide variety of ingenious means , we can detect very small nuclear tests in remote locations . the treaty is also fair — it incorporates equal rights and responsibilities for all of its parties . it sets a new standard for nuclear-arms obligations and verification . the ctbt is needed because of the role of nuclear tests in developing and improved nuclear weapons . such trials are also political symbols that have no place in a world determined to eliminate these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction .
the best example is us president barack obama , on whom so many hopes rested at him , probably too many for any single leader . the us needs leaders with enough mastery of detail , like china last premier zhu rongji , who can not only tell us how they will get us from z to z , but actually can lead us from the to b. looking around , leaders like it seem to be extinct . or , when they do exist at all , dysfunctional political systems appear to be being constrained by dysfunctional political systems . their ability to act has been constrained by their political landscape has been limited .
in reality , a palestinian state based on the 1967 borders is precisely what us president barack obama has called for . the un security council resolution resolved in november of that year that “ acquiring territory by war is unacceptable . ” today , palestinians are seeking statehood on a mere 22 % of the territories that were part of the mandatory palestine until israel was unilaterally established on areas far larger than those awarded by un general assembly resolution 181 in 1947 . subsequent un security council resolutions and international treaties have enshrined this very principle . palestine ’s quest for statehood within june 4 ’s borders is precisely what us president barack obama has called for .
in that sense , the economic success of either china or india may be those nation-states ’ undoing as middle - political agendas render contemporary arrangements dysfunctional . what policymakers ’ answer is depressingly predictable : in the face of a resurgent russia and china , this is no time to abandon us states and diplomacy to their own destiny . indeed , some argue that the inventiveness and the internationalism of a world networked through interests and shared causes are probably more resilient than one crammed into an artificial – and increasingly repressed – box in the nation-state . the question for international governance is how to provide a level of institutions and rules in a world of competing organizational structures . conversely , we may find ourselves in a world whose east is organized into strong authoritarian state structures with a west embracing post-state models of association .
many hope that these changes will help the ccp to become more efficient , enhance the market ’s role , and thus avoid the so-called middle-income trap that ensnared many emerging-market countries . the anti-corruption campaign mirrors the ccp ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s apparent determination to rid itself of vested interests . nevertheless , the party ’s rhetoric reveals little about how these goals will be achieved . indeed , there are worrying signs that the grand architect of the reform agenda , the highly respected free-market economist li keqiang , is already locked up . at its 2013 march third plenum , the ccp announced 60 objectives for economic and governance reforms .
countries can do more to make it harder for individuals to leave for iraqis or syria ; a europe-wide watch list , for example , would help . curtailing the flow of recruits is even more vital . such flows should be shut out of both governments and financial institutions . but nothing would have a greater impact than turkey ’s determination that it will no longer permit itself to be a conduit to enforce un security council resolution 2178 calling for stronger international cooperation against terrorism . another component of any strategy must be to counter is its appeal and propaganda .
political technology implies surreptitiously sponsoring fake politicians such as bogdanov , establishing fake ngo ’s and “ patriotic ” youth movements like nashi ( us ) to forestall a russia version of ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s orange revolution , and mobilizing voters against the carefully scripted “ enemy . ” medvedev himself may find some or all of this distasteful , but russia now has an entire industry of political manipulation that is hardly likely to go away overnight . the mechanics of russian succession politics also require understanding the mechanics of russia ’s succession politics . medvedev himself may find some or all of this distasteful , but russia now has an entire industry of political manipulation that is hardly prone to disappearing overnight . the enemy of communists in 1996 was communists ; in 1999-2000 , chechens ; in 2003-04 , “ oligarchs . ”
the visegrád cluster , cefta ’s central european initiative , has spawned a thriving , free trade system and an increasing flow of investment among the region ’s countries . through learning each other ’s languages , through cooperation based on shared values , common interests , as well as historic ties , central europeans have shown what spectacular results can be achieved . in a broader context , hungary ’s re-integration into western institutional structures is proceeding relentlessly , if not at the desired pace . the visegrád cluster , cefta , a central european initiative , has given rise to a thriving , free trade system and an increasing flow of investment among the region ’s countries . so our task has not only to remake the nation-state , but society too – too – its family values , its own national traditions , and its cultural hegemony .
in 1988 , conservationists decided to finance and build a electrified fence in order to protect the district of the aberdare national park bordering smallholder farms . the fence was designed to prevent the intrusion of people ’s population and park degradation . the aberdare mountains , encompassing 2,000 square kilometers of sea forest and vital water-catchment areas , as well as a national park , are vital to kenya . local farmers welcomed the initiative , which influenced decisions to expand the fence to surround an entire aberdare perimeter around the sea . but it also kept out the farmers whose crops were periodically destroyed by a marauding elephant and other wildlife .
new york – such protests have two major causes . first , social inequality has grown unabated over the past quarter-century , owing partly to the disappearance of the soviet union , and with it , the threat of expansionist communism . the specter of the revolution had driven western elites to use the power of the state to redistribute wealth and nurture the growth of the loyal middle class . but , with communism collapsing within its eurasian heartland , the west ’s wealthy , believing that they have nothing more to fear , pressed to roll back the welfare state , causing inequality to rise rapidly . this was tolerable as long as the overall pie expanded ; but the 2008 global financial crisis ended that .
in 1998 , the un estimated the total value of the illicit drugs trade at $ 400 billion , or 7 % of global trade . critics say that this figure is only half that – still a spectacular sum . so , too , are other latin american , caribbean , and asif countries . colombia today is far worse than chicago under al capone . drug prohibition effectively imposes a tax on global commerce on the illicit drugs enforced by governments and gathered by those willing to violate laws .
even when the volunteers were employed , they are nowhere near as enthusiastic as official accounts claim . tatiana insisted that bam construction began in 1974 of a politically correct date , after which it was used to take advantage of “ clean labor ” . but the first divide , initiated by stalin to offer an eastern route that ran farther away from the chinese border , was erected by forced labor , including russian inmates and germany , and japanese inmates of war , herded together in so-called “ bamlags , ” now ghost towns . tatiana ’s insistence that bam construction began in 1974 came a politically correct date after which “ clean labor ” was used . lacking adequate housing and electricity , few reenlisted and many deserted place before completion of its term .
whereas proportional representation will determine the two-thirds seats in the junior house , one-third will be elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies , where m5s will most likely lose out because it is neither willing nor able to form the electoral alliances needed to secure majorities . in fact , m5s ’s problem is that , owing to its new electoral law , it will need to win roughly 40 % of the total vote to secure a parliamentary majority . and with support at around 26-29 % , it remains popular , despite its poor performance at the township council of rome . as it demonstrated with his electoral victories in 1994 , 2001 , and 2008 , berlusconi has always had the greatest power to form coalitions . m5s ’s problem is that , thanks to its new electoral law , it will need to win roughly 40 % of the total vote to secure a parliamentary majority .
soon after taking office , the modi government announced its intention to implement the price increase , though officials made sure to emphasize that they were merely following through on the existing mandate . upa ’s critics long argued that unsustainably low , state-dictated passenger fares , and freight fees – which could not cover the cost of maintaining trains and tracks – far less able to expand and improve service delivery – reflected the government ’s inability to make tough choices . it is true that coalition politics prevented any decisive action , with a railroad minister summarily dismissed by his own party leader – whom the upa was politically unable to confront – following attempting to create some fares . but , in the pre-election provisional budget , the upa government ultimately bears some of the bullet , proposing a 14.2 % growth in railways fares , and a 6.5 % hike in freight rates . per india ’s code of political behavior , its budget changes were deferred until after the election .
this marks a breathtaking departure from seven decades of practice in managing an astonishing degree of cultural diversity . coupled with the government ’s plan to create citizens ’ even more problematic national register , the authorities would then be able to disenfranchisement any nation that is incapable of demonstrating to be indian . many indians , notably the poor , lack a documentary evidence of when and where to whom they were born ; even glamour ’s certificates have become widespread only in recent decades . under the agreed bill , muslim immigrants can be declared illegal . coupled with the government ’s plan to create citizens ’ even more problematic national register , the authorities would then be allowed to disenfranchisement among any nation that is incapable of demonstrating to be indian .
compounding the problem , no one really understands the precise links among russian and european institutions and markets . having just emerged from the deep recession , financial disruptions could easily tip europe into recession , particularly given europe ’s close linkages to russia through trade and energy . the collapse of ltcm in 1998 was entirely unexpected . is europe today poised to deal with a similar failure of an important financial institution ? is europe today prepared to cope with a similar failure by an important financial institution ?
gdp has almost tripled in the last 20 years , but , with real wages rising at less than half that rate , its growth has become decoupled from that of ordinary citizens . meanwhile , the signs of social hardship are spreading . south korea is troubled for two key reasons . gdp has almost tripled in the last 20 years ; fertility rates have dropped to their fourth lowest level among advanced economies ; and suicide rates are the highest in the oecd . more than half of middle-income households spend more each month than they earn .
this may mean eliminating shadowy “ tax havens , ” tapping telephone lines , and identifying individuals regarded as highly dangerous . while the european union lags behind the united states in terms of conventional weapons , its capacity to fight terrorism is probably higher . for historical reasons , europe benefits from a kind of political maturity that allowed it to avoid bush ’s manichean worldview that merely reinforced , rather than undermined , the enemy of ’s fanaticism . police actions need to be merciless , even if that means further controls and surveillance . it is precisely to prevent the development of shadowy “ tax havens , ” ” ” tapping telephone lines , and identifying individuals deemed highly dangerous .
whereas in the us house of representatives , mulvaney has received large donations from a payday loans industry that make most of its profits from lending at high interest rates to people with no alternative when it is in desperate need of cash . mulvaney has also committed considerable time over the last two years to weaken the safeguards that the consumer financial protection bureau has previously attempted to introduce to head off some of the industry ’s worst abuses . ross should read the mehrsa baradaran ’s informative book how the second half of the banks to reflected heavy credit costs for low-income families . or he could just ask mick mulvaney , the acting white house chief of staff . as the us government shutdown dragged on , the stock price of payday lenders soared .
seoul – a huge revolution in military matters across east asia is taking place all the way to foster international peace . there are , despite the escalating regional tensions that have inspired these moves , china ’s relationships with its neighbors and the united states are disingenuous to lead to direct confrontation . but the unrelenting march of new initiatives to meet the perceived “ threat of china ” will require the region ’s political leaders , including the imf , to resolve their disputes in new , more creative ways , if this outcome is to be avoided . the latest signs are chinese president xi jinping ’s ’s purge of general xu caihou , a former politburo member and former vice-chairman of the central military commission , on corruption charges , and japan ’s “ re-interpretation ” of articles 9 of its constitution to allow the country to provide military aid to its allies . more broadly , there are three paths to a foster for international peace : deepening economic interdependence , promotion of democracy , and the construction of international institutions .
new haven – the severity of the global financial crisis that we have seen over the last two years has to do with a fundamental source of instability in the banking system , one that we can and must design from existential challenges . in the midst of a severe financial crisis , banks find that a falling market value for many of their assets leaves them short of capital . to do this , we must advance the condition of our financial technology . nor can they raise much more capital during the crisis ; so , in order to restore capital-adequacy levels , they stop making new loans and call in their non-performing loans , thereby throwing the entire economy – if not the entire global economy – into a tailspin . to do so , we must advance the state of our financial technology .
but he maintained that islam was an essential part of the chechen tradition , and was presented to itself as a leader who fully understood this . kadyrov also catered to the spiritual aspirations of the chechen majority . so he encouraged an islamic dress code and built an enormous mosque – one of the largest , if not the largest , of europe . but he maintained that islam was an essential part of the chechen tradition and presented itself as a leader who fully understood this . he rejected wahhabism – the jihadists ’ ideological framework .
the education system needs to be rebuilt nearly from scratch , and with so many women anxious to return to learn , a revived educational system will also help afghanistan ’s democratic politicians get a powerful workers lobby . at the same time , roads , airports , and communications systems must be revitalized if trade is to recover . concrete attention should be given to elementary schools and libraries outside of towns . roads , airports , and communications systems also need to be re-supplied if trade is to be revived . village housing must be provided at massive levels .
indeed , it is the capsule ’s depiction of the united states federal reserve and the european central bank . likewise , the great depression of the 1930 ’s , when the fed stood idly by as the economy collapsed , is the molding event seared into the consciousness of every american central banker . one popular explanation for both banks ’ divergent approaches is that they stem from their societies ’ respective historical experience . what i have just described is no mere hypothetical . the banks ’ institutional personalities reflect the role of collective memory in shaping how the officials conceptualize the problems they face .
not one of his new york times commentaries in the first half of 2013 , when “ austerian ” deficit-cutting “ obama has taken effect , ” predicted major reductions in unemployment , or that they will recover to brisk rates . on the other hand , “ a disastrous turn toward austerity has destroyed millions of jobs and wiped out many lives , ” he argued , with america ’s congress exposing the americans to an imminent threat of severe economic damage from short-term spending cuts . as a result , “ full recovery still looks very long way , ” ” ” he warned . not one of his new york times commentaries in his end-of-2014 column on “ obama ’s recovery . ” “ and i ’m starting to worry that it may never happen . ”
even though many of them are in trouble , that is probably not the best time to start a new car company , either . a small operation in finland is less than a role model for companies that the team hopes may spring up globally . borrowing from the open-access software movement , räsänen and his colleagues want the idea and basic designs free , and encourage lots of companies all over the world to implement it locally . the group ’s initiative , chaired by contract räsänen , is called ecars – now ! – is called ecars – now ! with the establishment of a new car company , even though many are in trouble , that is probably not the best time to start a new car company , either .
but i believe that there is more wishful thinking than hardheaded logic among those calling for a “ color revolution . ” compared to these failures , vladimir putin ’s accomplishments in chechnya look like the heights of its achievement . consider , for example , that no one has ever developed an accurate means of measuring , whether , and to what extent , a government is effective . the united states , with a government that can barely be described as weak , bungled the war in iraq , and the aftermath of hurricane katrina . when the criterion of effectiveness is an ability to achieve all of society ’s goals , we are likely to never find such a thing .
unfortunately , many african governments lack the means to fund programs that could build on those gains . simply put , a new – more collaborative – approach to african science is urgently needed . these and other financing streams helped african researchers develop drought-resilient crops , produce infectious disease vaccines like ebola , and expand health-care opportunities for science and technology education . in 2003 , the african union and the upcoming partnerships for africa ’s development began implementing a continent-wide strategy to develop and deploy the science and technology for the continent ’s socioeconomic transformation and its integration into the global economy . africa ’s leaders pooled their science resources before .
london – five years after the collapse of america ’s investment bank lehman brothers , the world has yet to deal with the fundamental cause of the subsequent financial crisis , an excess of debt . official forecasts in the spring of 2009 anticipated neither a slow recovery , nor that an initial crisis , essentially confined to the united states and the united kingdom , would soon fuel a knock-on crisis in europe . and , once an immediate crisis was contained , we failed to anticipate just how painful its effects would have been . most economists , central bankers , and regulators not only failed to anticipate the crisis , but also believed that financial stability had been assured so long as inflation was low and stable . and that is precisely why economic recovery has advanced a lot more slowly than anyone expected ( it did n’t come at all in some countries ) .
a third agreement in phase two will center around the uk-eu roadmap after 2021 . this will not become a free-trade arrangement , but rather a political declaration on where both sides hope to end it . for britons in the “ leave ” camp , such a transition lets the uk remain in the eu by any means name . and , for some of those in the “ leave ” camp , it is a route to exit without falling on the cliff edge . the big difference is that the uk will lose out on the table .
the islamic world is riven by disputes between the arab and non-arab , sunni , and shia , and salafi extremists and theological moderates . al qaeda 's agenda is just as much about creating a new islamic caliphate as it is about waging jihad against the west . fourth , europeans find it hard to stomach traditional islamic attitudes towards , say , women or homosexuals . al qaeda 's agenda is just as much about creating a new islamic caliphate as it is about imposing jihad against the west . to the extent that europeans are christian at all , we see religion as one of the individual ’s attachment to his or her god ; muslims see it as an organizing social order .
yanukovych was always the kremlin ’s ally . indeed , his 2010 election marked the end of ukraine ’s emergence as a pro-european orange revolution , defeating his effort to steal the 2004 presidential election and keep ukraine at bay in the russian camp . with the collapse of the soviet union , russia was not only losing its status as a world power ; within europe it was forced to retreat into the frontier that it extended the westphalia since peter the great , ultimately to the elbe and the buddingia . so why has the eu been unable to offer ukraine anything comparable to what russia has offered ? the answer can be found in europe ’s relations with russia .
for employees to develop , they must be imdded in the stimulating workplace , with new difficulty solving , harder tasks to be mastered , added abilities to strive for them . in essence , it is productive change that i advocate , which i call economic dynamism . the late 1990 ’s produced evidence that low dynamism was linked to weak economic performance , especially low prosperity . so what is needed for high performance ? less obviously , a country wants misguided or nonsensical change ; it wants investment that appears to be in the financial sector as productive .
first , because most technology-based monopoly power does not violate existing antitrust laws , regulating it will require new measures to weaken monopolies . first , because most technology-based monopoly power does not violate existing antitrust laws , regulating it will require new measures to weaken monopolies . second , standard view of business income and taxation will have to adjust to account for it firms ’ monopoly power . and , third , laws designed to protect private information should be reevaluated in order to ensure that companies are unable to profit from exploiting and manipulating it . new concepts of public concern are also required to regulate new channels of public information like social networks .
geneva – with france launching its third “ humanitarian ” military operation in as many years , this time in the central african republic , the interventionism that seemed discredited in the aftermath of america ’s invasion of iraq appears to have reverted as the accepted norm in international affairs . indeed , decades of relentless military intervention have shifted the terms of debate , with recent operations justified by its achievability rather than merit . to understand how this shift has come to view why , more often than not , such interference has failed to make any significant difference on events on the ground . as france ’s recent actions demonstrate , intervention nowadays requires little more than unilateral decree of humanitarian or counterterrorism objectives , an atmosphere of urgency , and an ambiguous connection to the ongoing united nations deliberations . a military operation might also be mentioned in the un security council , but only after the fact when a council of action can no longer make a significant difference on events on the ground .
both coase and krugman bemoan the neglect of their profession ’s patrimony – a tradition dating at least to adam smith – that prized grand and unifying theories of political economy and moral philosophy . the simplicity and the elegance of micro and macro models makes them useful in explaining the price mechanism and the equilibrium or imbalance of key aggregate economic variables . like their provenance of the findings , he argues , economists have become blind to the catastrophic macro failure because they have fuzzy the beauty or elegance of theoretical models for truth-making . but both models are incapable of describing or characterizing key market participants ’ real behavior . the contemporary obsession with the reductionist , mechanical models seems to have propelled the profession from theory toward ideology , tying it to touch with the real economy .
after all , such no-strings-attached databases are now cropping up in international discussions , including at the world health organization and the un food and agriculture organization . the forthcoming meeting ( cop 13 ) will take place in cancún , mexico , in early december . after all , such no-strings-attached databases is now cropping up in cancún , mexico , in early december . policeman 13 must focus on the need to protect the rights of resource providers . perhaps the biggest forum for such discussions is the conference of parties to the convention on biological diversity , the major treaty regulating access to biodiversity .
but , for everyone except bush – and those left unemployed by a lag in demand – that is an enormous opportunity . if america can grow as fast as it is now , america faces the hardest work in securing growth , for it must generate – and not only copy and adapt – new technologies , better forms of capital , and more productive business organizations . the remarkable boosts in terms of productivity that were within america ’s grasp will ultimately lead to accelerating growth in real gains and real wages if only american policymakers resist the temptation to pursue politically expedient but economically harmful ones , measures of “ protecting ” output and employment today . if america can grow as fast as it is now , america faces the hardest work in securing growth , for it must generate – and not only copy and adapt – new technologies , better forms of capital , and more productive business organizations . the remarkable boosts to the productivity that was within america ’s grasp will ultimately lead to accelerating growth of real earnings and real wages if only american policymakers resist the temptation to pursue politically expedient but economically harmful us measures that have resulted .
at a time of unprecedented global challenges , including climate change and high levels of inequality , this must include using platform leadership ’s unprecedented power to catalyze global-scale solutions . in order to stave off another public backlash , such platforms must compel us to move not just as consumers , but also as business leaders , workers , and the public . rather than focusing on meeting rising demand for meat through scaling up factory-farming operations , as companies have done in the past , it is – and similar corporations like impossible foods – that are working to help reduce overall meat consumption , the main driver of climate change . that propelling the latest shift at the corporate stakeholdership beyond meat celebrated a rapturous stock-market debut . at a time of unprecedented global challenges , including climate change and high levels of inequality , this must include using platform leadership ’s unprecedented power to catalyze global-scale solutions .
ontario – this december , trade ministers from around the world will converge in buenos aires for the world trade organization ’s ministerial conference last month . this time , though , the result may be an even more disappointing one , with delegates unable to reach even a symbolic agreement that they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign . the wto ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ministerial gatherings are never easy to achieve . some sort of deal is commonly delivered , but only at the latest moment , and its language has often been vague . with the united states having historically spearheaded the world toward trade liberalization now actively dampening trade tensions , the meeting is set to , in contrast to any other .
similar norms exist in poland in the czech republic , hungary , latvia , and lithuania . by obscuring the role that local populations played in both the nazi and communist crimes , such laws help advance the nationalist narratives that can prove a very handy to politicians seeking to win popular support . the pis , for one , has attracted substantial electoral support , owing partly to its exploitation of past tragedies for political ends . there are even more extreme cases than that produced by poland , for example . poland introduced such a law in 1998 .
as is often pointed out , if banking regulations are identical across frontiers , there will be ample scope for lasting “ regulatory arbitrage . ” admittedly , there are difficulties in meeting every proposal to limit the scope of a more “ risky ” banking sector , particularly when it comes to the global economy with free capital mobility . this would give capital buffers to be created in good years , which might then be drawn down in bad years . admittedly , there are difficulties in reform proposals to limit the extent of a more “ risky ” banking run , particularly with respect to the global economy ’s free capital mobility . as is often pointed out , if banking regulations were identical across frontiers , there would be ample scope for lasting “ regulatory arbitrage . ”
new york – america ’s patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) , us president barack obama ’s signature 2010 health-care reform , has succeeded in expanding insurance coverage to the millions of americans who would not otherwise have had it . and , contrary to the critics ’ warnings , it has not pushed up health-care costs ; in fact , there is some hope that the cost curve may , at last , be bending downward . but whether “ obamacare ” succeeds in curbing excessively high health-care costs is not assured . that will depend on the obama administration ’s other policies , particularly in an area that might seem unrelated : the united states ’ ongoing debate with india over intellectual property . and here , obama seems determined to undermine his own signature reform , owing to the pressure of america ’s powerful pharmaceutical lobby .
if both the old and new industries of the economy are in a slump , capital formation will sputter , investment in upgrading human capital will decline , and structural adjustment will stall . likewise , cutting fiscal support ( via government-directed bank lending ) to zombie firms would free up fiscal capacity and enable resources to redirected to new sectors that facilitate service and urban employment ; but this would exacerbate , at least at first , today ’s demand shortfall . robust aggregate demand has always been key to success under a successful transformation . economic historians , notably michael bernstein , in his 2009 study of the great depression at the united states , have shown conclusively that an economy in transition requires strong aggregate demand to drain resources in new industries . slashing the state sector and expecting transformation via austerity is not the way forward .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . with innovations in digital payments barreling ahead , these questions are now being commanding the attention in the world economic forum and other international institutions . london – how radically will digital currencies alter our methods of exchange and how we think about money ?
bangalore – us secretary of state john kerry ’s valiant effort to salvage the israeli-palestinian peace process is about to work out in a default . though achieving a substantive settlement was always a pipe dream , this latest disappointment will render the united states incapable of preserving even the façade of the “ peace process ” that was all of the process and no peace . negotiations fail for several reasons , beginning with israel ’s continued colonization of lands occupied in 1967 , despite opposition from the international community , including the american one . if anything , israel has accelerated settlement construction since the latest round of talks began , while also escalating its demands , particularly regarding stationing israeli soldiers in the jordan valley . and that may not be so much a bad thing after that .
vasily aleksanyan was the executive vice president of yukos , and , as a lawyer , defended khodorkovsky and his partner , platon lebedev , after their arrest in 2003 . by that time , aleksanyan was critically ill with aids , for whom treatment had been withheld . by that time , aleksanyan was critically ill with aids , for whom treatment had been withheld . vasily aleksanyan was executive vice president of yukos and , as a lawyer , defended khodorkovsky and his partner , platon lebedev came to power in january 2003 , following their arrest in 2003 . he was subsequently disbarred , and was himself arrested in april 2006 .
moreover , they need it to happen by the end of the year to avoid potentially damaging the big tariff hikes currently scheduled for december 15 . that timeline requires that both sides begin to take symbolic and substantive steps immediately . as an initial step , china should propose an agreement using the same text as the previous 150-page draft , but with a revisions to meet its three “ red lines . ” specifically , china should remove american provisions for retaining tariffs once the agreement is signed , and for unilaterally imposing tariffs if the america concludes that it has not honoring the agreement . and it should add a commitment that china will execute the treaty in a way that is “ in line with its own constitutional , legislative , and regulatory processes . ”
princeton – much of today ’s advanced economies became what they were by traveling the well-worn path of industrialization . a labour movement led to mass politics and , ultimately , to political democracy . peasants became factory workers , a process that underpinned not only an unprecedented rise in economic productivity , but also a wholesale revolution in social and political organization . the progression of manufacturing industries , textiles , steel , automobiles , rose from the ashes of traditional artisans and guild systems , transformed agrarian societies into urban ones . over time , manufacturing had ceded its location to services .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
and , obviously , that average does not even include the fukushima disaster . indeed , when compared to other energy supplies , the nuclear industry ranks higher than that of oil , coal , and natural gas systems in terms of potential fatalities , second only to hydroelectric dams . while only a handful of involved in fatalities , those that collectively killed more people than have died in commercial america ’s airline crashes since 1982 . indeed , when compared to other sources of energy , the nuclear powers ranks higher than the oil , coal , or natural-gas systems in the us , second only to hydroelectric dams . there have been 57 incidents since the chernobyl catastrophe in 1986 , respectively .
in contrast to some of her predecessors as chancellor , merkel , who grew up in eastern germany , remains wary of russia ’s strategic message . some people are n’t overly concerned about this , at least in the short run , from america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s own leadership abdication . again , russia is closer to berlin , or even to paris than to washington or new york . there can be little doubt that the us and russia will benefit , at least in the short run , from america ’s ’s ’s ’s leadership abdication . indeed , russia seems to be closer to berlin , or even to paris than to washington or new york .
and that would have been the case with the colombian accord , which addresses a vast array of social and economic issues , including problems affecting indigenous communities , gender equality , gay rights , and more than a half-century of combat . the deal has also included an historic land-reform program . the negotiators decided that it would be impossible to introduce an unconditional application of justice . but , when negotiating well , the end result yields far more benefits than costs . for uribe and his opposition allies , the main objection to the deal concerns how it addresses the question of transitional justice .
america , for example , was wrong to invade iraq in 2003 , but it was right to join in the struggle against isis and to rescue the yazidis from the massacre . it was also wrong to call for the overthrow of syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime , for that reason that the forces have opposed assad have lacked the necessary popular support , and america has been unprepared to help them win that support . it was right to attack the occupied city of mosul , but it was wrong to reduce the city in order to dust . helping the syrian kurds , on the other hand , was a good idea , because they were effective fighters from their own ; and they most likely would not have survived under the isis caliphate . elsewhere , it is right to bolster south koreans and japanese defenses , but evidently wrong now to threaten a nuclear war .
the individual became the ultimate agent of change – individual conceived as the type of rational actor that populates economists ’ models . the trouble began at the end of the cold war , when the collapse of a bankrupt communist ideology complacently interpreted such a market triumph . as communism was discarded , so was the concept of the state as an agent around which our collective interests and ambitions could be organized . the individual became the ultimate agent of change – individual conceived as the type of rational actor that populates economists ’ models . such an individual ’s identity comes not from class interests or other sociological characteristics , but from market logic , which dictates maximization of self-interest , whether as a producer , consumer , or voter .
madrid june ’s turkish general election sent a powerful message : turkey ’s democracy remains intact . with their votes , turkey ’s citizens have denied the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) the absolute majority it needs to amend the constitution . indeed , whereas there have been some grievances over transparency during the campaign process , democracy has prevailed , with an astonishing 86 % of eligible voters turning out – a rate rarely seen in europe . moreover , by uniting the peoples ’ democratic party ( hdp ) – which is bringing together the country ’s long-marginalized kurdish minority and other groups – more than 10 % of the vote has allowed the party to enter parliament in may , with representation across the country , rather than just in the kurd-majority areas . the rest of the world , and europe in particular , should take note .
to distribute the burden more equitably , germany has attempted to have a european quota system instituted to allocate claimants among the eu members . should an application of the eu succeed , a refugee has a responsibility to pull its or members along the way . germany will have to address the consequences of this refugee wave for years to come . but germany ’s eu partners have rejected this as “ moral imperialism . ” frequently , arab families send their minors to germany in the not-undue hope of getting the right to other family members to follow later .
washington , dc – anyone watching the united states ’ presidential race needs to understand that national opinion polls no longer provide an accurate picture of how the election could swerve . the candidate who cross a threshold of 270 electoral college votes wins the presidency . by almost every state , the candidate who wins 50.1 % of the popular vote wins the presidency . because of america ’s electoral college , it ’s not who wins the most votes nationwide that matters at last , but who wins where nation wins . each state is awarded some of the vote in an electoral college depending on the size of its population .
new york – the prospect that america ’s federal reserve will start exiting the zero policy rate later this year has fueled growing fear of renewed volatility in emerging economies ’ currencies , bond yields , and the stock market . because all have borrowed trillions of dollars over the past few years , they will now confront an increase in the true local-currency value of those debts , while rising american rates will push emerging markets ’ domestic interest rates higher , thereby increasing debt-service costs further . indeed , rising interest rates in the united states , and the imminent rise in the dollar ’s value may , is feared , wreak havoc among emerging-market governments , financial institutions , corporations , and even households . now , because all have borrowed trillions of dollars over the past few years , they will now confront an increase in the real local-currency value of those debts , while rising american rates push emerging markets ’ domestic interest rates higher , thereby raising debt-service costs further . but , while the prospect of the fed raising interest rates is likely to generate significant turbulence in emerging countries like financial markets , the risk of outright crises and distress has become more subdued .
on the old commission headed by romano prodi , france has been powerfully represented , with pascal lamy holding the trade portfolio . on the other hand , despite being right about iraq , chirac has become isolated , an isolation that has grown , for he has also failed to re-establish satisfactory relations with president bush . faced with american unilateralism , he has failed to promote realistic multilateral solutions . chirac has compounded his mistake over iraq as part of his approach to the new european commission . indeed , under chirac , france appears increasingly arrogant , a nation convinced of the righteousness of its views , and of the universalism of its model – a very accusations so frequently levelled against george w. bush ’s america .
and the expanding global population – set to reach more than $ 9.5 billion by 2050 – will continue to constrain water resources further . governments should take the lead in ensuring cautious management and sustainable use of scarce water-resources . urgent action is needed to ensure access to safe , affordable water and sanitation for all . water-intensive food and energy production , among others , depend on uninterrupted supplies . first , drastic improvements in water-related services , including supplies and sanitation , irrigation and drainage , energy , and environmental facilities , are necessary to improve health outcomes , enabling more people to escape poverty .
while iran ’s leaders often downplayed the sanctions ’ impact , president mahmoud ahmadinejad recently cited them as the ultimate culprit behind iran ’s recent economic turmoil . ahmadinejad has benefited from a massive spike in oil prices , resulting in unprecedented levels of earnings . but iran has confronted a similar economic hardship before , when oil exports collapsed dramatically amid the country ’s eight-year iran-iraq war , and , in 1986-2000 , global oil prices were extremely low and handled relatively well . four factors turned the iranian oil embargo into a particularly intolerable position today . first , prohibiting oil exports becomes more painful when world oil prices skyrocketed .
israel expects the obama administration not only to appreciate the unique context of its ambiguous nuclear status , but also to recognize that it can not be forthcoming when assuring its neighbors or the rest of the world regarding its nuclear program unless the middle east ’s political environment changes in a radically positive fashion . indeed , across-the-board nuclear equality may ultimately only give a boost to iran ’s nuclear assertions . israel expects the obama administration not only to appreciate its unique background of its ambiguous nuclear status , but also to recognize that it can not be forthcoming in assuring its neighbors or the rest of the world about its nuclear program unless the middle east political environment changes in a radically positive way . israel expects the obama administration not only to appreciate the unique context of its ambiguous nuclear status , but also to recognize that it can not be forthcoming when assuring its neighbors or the rest of the world about its nuclear program unless the middle east ’s political environment changes in a radically positive manner . across-the-board nuclear equality may ultimately only give a boost to iran ’s nuclear assertions .
the genius of china ’s mini-move ( allowing the yuan to rise 2 % against the us dollar ) is that no one can tell whether or what happens next . protectionists in the united states and europe , itching to slap enormous punitive tariffs on chinese goods , have been caught flat-footed . they want to stay bathing in press coverage , but if they do push their china-bashing too far and too fast , the protectionists will be seen as curtailing a delicate behind-the-scenes negotiation . whatever the ultimate economic effects of china , ’s modest move toward floating its currency , one must admire its strategic brilliance . but no one really knows whether china ’s baby step is the start of something much greater , because china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s goods regions hint up one day , deny the next .
one of his close political allies recently declared that the un security council should authorize military intervention in syria , france could envision nato participation in that effort . and here obama , in particular , will quickly come to understand that hollande has no intention of bringing sweeping change . hollande has promoted the military intervention in libya in may 2011 , and has joined the condemnation of syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime . on the other hand , his stated ambition will be to emerge as a reliable and previously unsurprising partner . hollande is unlikely to be any less amicable with america than was sarkozy , viewed by many as france ’s most pro-european president .
hence the keynesian solution : use monetary policy ( at lower interest rates ) and fiscal policies ( expanded government expenditure and reduced taxes ) to keep the economy out of ever approaching the precipice where deflation becomes possible . deflation -- steady , ongoing collapse of prices -- gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and trash cash . it reduced the capacity of firms and banks to service their debt , and it could trigger a chain of large-scale bankruptcies , which would erode confidence in the financial system and provide yet more incentives to quash . but if this is the question that has been resolved over fifty years ago , why has it been so haunting us now ? deflation -- steady , ongoing collapse of prices -- gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and get rid of cash .
millions of children are undernourished and outside school ; millions have witnessed unspeakable brutality ; and tens of thousands are threatened with exploitation , abuse , and , worse . and of the 50 million children living outside their own countries or have been internally displaced , more than half have been forcibly uprooted , and are faced with new threats to their lives and well-being . the united nations – with support from countries like sweden – and working through a coordinated humanitarian-response system that includes unicef , is mitigated suffering whenever and wherever it may . but the quantity and complexity of cascading crises are testing that system , as never before . this is not rhetoric ; it is reality .
overcoming the formidable challenge that climate change poses to africa will depend on moments of collective focus and clarity . given their heightened vulnerability , african countries have every incentive to set the bar high , thereby putting pressure on others to ramp up their own donations . to that end , a coalition of african nations , sponsored by the un economic commission for africa and the new climate economy , is working to facilitate meaningful , coordinated action that puts the continent on a more inclusive , sustainable growth path . partnerships with national finance and planning ministries , relevant asia-pacific finance institutions , and the private sector will underpin this process . next month , the un secretary-general for the un climate summit should be only such a moment , with countries committing to follow through on their emissions-reduction targets under the 2015 paris climate agreement to reach $ net-zero emissions by mid-century .
but the realignment of the rich , developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists such as milton friedman , which began around 1970 , has broken all in all of them . common instability in social relations , most important , is not only in democratic countries if electorates dismiss its own underpinnings . successful capitalism could be reinvented after world war ii because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation : the social security that served as a principal stabilizer ; at least in advanced countries ; keynesian tools to fight domestic cyclical downturns ; and a universal high-wage policy aimed at stimulating general consumption , without which the genius of free-market capitalism , mass production , does not work . and there can not be a stable economic order – at least not in democratic countries – if electorates do reject its underpinnings . the rejection of the european union ’s constitutional treaty by french and dutch voters was , by all accounts , more a rejection of unregulated globalization than a rejection of europe .
at the same time , in an age of online rumors and fake news , the world today may look a bit of unmoored from history . inflation targeting has other effects , too , that seems to be more on central bankers ’ minds . in his influential 1998 book inflation targeting , ben bernanke and his co-authors counseled policymakers to announce target inflation because it communicates the central bank in its intentions , ” which would “ reduce uncertainty . ” its announced rates should become substantially positive , they wrote , because , if officials tried to take it close to zero , any error might result from a deflation that “ might endanger the financial system and precipitate an economic contraction . ” that might create a sense of true risk , too .
berkeley – with its ambitious creation at the china 2025 strategy , china has made clear its goal of securing global economic leadership in cutting-edge high-tech industries . that places it in direct competition with the united states , which is currently leading in those industries – in what is emerging as an undeclared but intensifying cold war over technologies with both commercial and military applications . and it has deployed a wide range of methods , including weak intellectual-property ( ip ) protections ; technology transfers as a condition for joint ventures with chinese partners ; evasion of export controls ; and regulatory harassment of the us and other trading partners . china ’s intentions and practices have long been an irritant in sino-american relations . with its investments in such dual-use technologies , china is seeking more than having to compete commercially with america ; it is also seeking more military and geopolitical power .
the berlin wall fell , bringing germany ’s reunification , and yugoslavia into disarray . soon thereafter , slovakia ’s “ velvet divorce ” gave way to the czech republic and ukraine , which – along with other central and eastern european countries ( including hungary and poland ) – then anchored firmly in the west , by joining both nato and the eu . today , a trade war would hurt all economies . but an america that is relatively less dependent on foreign markets possesses deeper domestic markets , and is generally more economically resilient than other countries – would do better than most others in a contracting global economy . already , chinese financial markets have suffered , while those in the us hold their own .
the esm is ireland ’s insurance policy as we work our way out of its bailout program with the “ troika ” ( the european commission , the ecb , and the international monetary fund ) , and back to markets . the treaty would promote stability in the irish economy , and it would contribute to stabilizing europe , the us currency . ratification would also give the us guaranteed access to funding from the european stability mechanism ( esm ) – that is , should we ever need it . most important , under the mff proposed new reforms , the us fiscal treaty promises to ensure responsible budgeting across europe . most important , the eu ’s fiscal treaty promises to ensure responsible eurozone-wide budgeting .
that is a difficult subject to resolution , and doing so is hampered by lobbying efforts and incomplete information . last year , legislation to protect personal data is not comprehensive ; much of the rest of the world lacks even rudimentary safeguards . after reviewing this issue with legislators in several countries over the last few months , it has become abundantly clear that many have no full accounting of the myriad issues that must be considered . all organizations should be investing in ethics officers or some form of review process involving people who can assess all of the implications of a great-sounding idea . in europe , legislation protecting personal data is not comprehensive , and much of the rest of the world lacks even rudimentary safeguards .
but it must navigate a difficult path , because both points of view have major public support . traditional versus modern , urban versus rural , male intellectuals versus peasantry : these divisions are the stuff of political cliché . bangladeshi rule ’s sympathies are closer to shahbag protestors than to the hifazat counter-demonstrators . but , all too often , clichés are becoming established because they are true . the young at shahbag are mainly urban , well-educated , and middle class ; hifazat derives in support mainly from the rural poor .
true bombshell , however , was the sudden realization of the threat posed by digital currencies to the existing monetary system , not to some later date , but right now . even the staunchest defenders of the existing monetary system will admit that it does not work equally for everyone . with the potential to mobilize more than two billion monthly active users of active users , facebook could change that . now that the society has dropped the gauntlet , governments should take advantage of the chance to advance a form of digital currency that serves the public good . cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade now , but none has been adopted widely enough to challenge the existing order .
why did the great recession and the disastrous meltdown at the fukushima daiichi plant in japan not elicited a similar reaction today ? before i became soviet leader in 1985 , relations between cold war superpowers hit rock bottom . economic constraints and the chernobyl catastrophe helped to spur us to take action . reagan and i were able to build up a reservoir of more constructive spirit through persistent outreach and face-to-face interaction . what seems missing today are leaders with both boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of the peaceful global order .
across europe , it is not only british prime minister tony blair who is charged with the “ presidentialism ” nowadays . german chancellor gerhard schröder faces similar charges in the current german election campaign . august is the traditional month when parliaments for recess for the summer . it offers a moment to examine why they are so enfeebled . prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy faces no such charge in the current german election campaign .
as long as capital flows remain large relative to the liquid assets held by national governments , and were easily reversible , the international economy will be hostage to spectacular booms and bust cycles . second , it is doubtful that the new policy agenda will make the international financial system far safer . indeed , by shifting attention to internal structural reform in the developing world , the risk is that the current approach will lead to complacency about short-term capital flows , escalating rather than lowering systemic risks . first , a new set of outside disciplines will come hand-in-hand with a particular neoliberal model of economic-development that remains untested and forecloses development strategies that worked in the past and others that might work in the future . the narrowing of national autonomy in formulating development strategies is a cost to which developing countries are unlikely to receive an adequate reward .
and all of these clichés have been reproduced in coverage of barra ’s appointment at gm . if all else fails , the coverage concentrates so narrowly on gender that a woman ’s very leadership is weakened . a number of news stories about female ceos and other high achieving women have become coded with a set of reliable clichés : lucked to their new roles ( and thus undeserving ) , inherited from male relatives or classroom ( and therefore did not really hold the reins of power ) , or would not be there for a long time . moreover , many news stories of female ceos and other high achieving women have become coded with a set of reliable clichés : lucked into their new roles ( and thus undeserving ) ; inherited them from male relatives or classroom ( and hence do n’t really hold the reins of power ) ; nor will they be there for long . these clichés not only undermine successful women ’s reputations ; in the case of the ceos , they cut their value to their company .
state-owned enterprises continue to be favored , the books are burned , and the communist party of china continues to assert its primacy in any domain of chinese life . how long this will last is anybody ’s guess , but in 2021 , that the cpc will mark the centenary of its founding . the dynasties come and go , but , in 2021 , the cpc will mark the centenary of its founding . few observers expected that china would abruptly transform itself into a full-fledged democracy following its accession to the world trade organization in 2001 . yet the country ’s repressive turn over the last decade has so far been disappointing .
more recently , elections in europe ’s postcommunist countries have brought groups into power whose democratic credentials are dubious , to say the least . this is not to compare hamas with any of these political forces . nevertheless , one must wonder a victorious movement with relatively few elected members , in israeli prisons , and others , who are unlikely to obtain permission to enter a country where they were elected , so that a new parliament can not function properly . all of this tells us three things about democracy itself . first , elections rarely solve basic problems .
the social awareness of homo putinicus , meticulously burnished of tv propagandists is such that the pride of lugovoi ’s achievement , and the indignation at the infamous campaign unleashed against him by those who resent russia can jangle themselves within the glary breast of ordinary russians with the slightest dissonance . apparently , we are evidently confronted with the mystery of russians thinking that the patriots gushing over lugovoi ’s grub’s ’s ’s achievement and indignation at the infamous campaign unleashed against him by those who loathed russia may jangle within a buddhist russians , without the slightest dissonance . this is why , of course , lugovoi is being asked for his autograph . but only one such “ patriot ” was granted credit for being allowed to perform this act . apparently , this should n’t be taken for mean that the patriots gushing over lugovoi ’s goal of admitting the justice of the british responsible .
and , because inequality of opportunity reduces social mobility from one generation to the next , it creates persistent inequalities . moreover , given that inequality largely begins in childhood , governments must invest far more in high-quality universal health care and early childhood education . only by supporting the creation of human capital of an early-age can we ensure that inequalities within a single generation are not passed down on to the next . · putting aside opportunity , governments must address the root causes of inequality by identifying and eliminating discriminatory laws , not least those that actually criminalize the problem . · such investment will demand an additional domestic resource .
some , it should be emphasized , are being made . italy has grasped crucially important reforms in areas like pension . greece has cut spending by a larger gdp , relative to gdp , than any country in europe since world war ii . other reforms , especially political reform , will be hotly contested . other reforms , notably , will be hotly contested .
understandably , fixated on balance-sheet repair , american consumers have n’t adopted the bait of their monetary and fiscal authorities . but the aftershocks linger : household-debt loads were still at 113 % of disposable personal income in 2012 ( versus 75 % in the final three decades of the twentieth century ) , and personal-saving rates averaged just 3.9 % last year ( versus 7.9 % from 1970 to 1999 ) . two bubbles – property and credit , against which american families have borrowed freely – have long burst . gains in inflation-adjusted personal-consumption spending have averaged only 0.8 % over the last five years , the most worrisome and protracted slowdown of consumer demand in the post-world war ii era . instead , they have cut back on spending .
though his motivation , at least partly , may have been a desire for social justice , perón was , in effect , bribing the recipients to back his own rise to power and wealth . argentina became less reliant on foreign trade , although move toward autarky ultimately undermined growth , causing the country to lose ground among the world ’s richest . perón ’s government nationalized banks and railroads , increased the minimum wage and improved living standards , reduced the national debt ( for a time that at least ) , and revived the economy . he was just as good as his word , and the only way to do that . with his beautiful and out-fed wife , a “ woman of the people ” at his side , perón was allowed , in effect , to persuade voters , in 1946 , to change the country fundamentally .
in the end , amid street riots and political mayhem , argentina has abandoned its currency peg to the rest of the world in 2002 . the cap ’s defenders will sound unconvincing , because the economy ’s case for it is weak when it comes to lack of extremes of credibility that are set to continue for the foreseeable future . it is not hard to imagine the next administration whenever it comes about – perceiving the cap as an impediment to faster economic growth . the cap will likely become even more politically controversial once brazil recovers . it is not hard to imagine the next administration whenever it comes about – perceiving the cap as a barrier to faster economic growth .
part of this may be explained by misunderstandings about the relationship between the stock-market price and the rate of economic growth . a peculiarity of this conventional wisdom , elaborated by markets worthwhile , even for noninvestors : political confidence may be in the low ebb in europe ; business and consumers may be shell-shocked by the latest recession and gloomy about the future ; but judging by the market ’s behavior the years ahead , it seems , reflecting a stable , prosperous 1950s and 1960s than the crisis-ridden decades of 1973 . part of this can be explained by misunderstandings about the relationship between stock market prices and economic growth . while experts spent the past two years propounding this thesis the market has quietly restored an older , more common-sense rule : prosperity is good for gains , and hence good for equities . prosperity , it has been felt , would incite inflation provoking sky-high interest rates , triggering a stock-market rout .
a legislative advisory program is another tool in business can use to influence public policy . elsewhere , the nigerian federation of chambers of commerce , industry , food manufacturing , and agriculture ( naccima ) has used its agenda over several years to coordinate economic reform . a legislative advisory program is yet another instrument of entrepreneurship , owing to a country ’s opening to democracy . to shape regulation such a program requires : * sound economic analysis and closed-papers papers readily available for technocrats and others to study ;
the imf mobilized massive amounts of money ( $ 118 billion for indonesia , korea , and thailand , so that they would pay back foreign creditors try to back their funds . the currencies collapsed , and the banking sector collapsed . the imf had mobilized massive amounts of money ( three percentage points in all ) to indonesia , korea , and thailand , so that they would pay back foreign creditors trying to back their money . now the imf has acknowledged thailand ’s ability to shrink by about three percentage points . its medicine has done little to rescue the economy .
nevertheless , highlighting obama ’s ability to get things done abroad is more than attempting to distraction ; it also sends the message that the domestic-policy impasse is not his fault . election-year tactics aside , american voters are right . the obama administration knows the iron law of american politics , “ it ’s the economy , stupid ” , as it does anyone else . obama has performed far better in foreign policy than it is in domestic politics – all the more surprising given the soft hand that he has been dealt with : an america that has lost its moral authority , its military invincibility , and his credibility as the economic model . so expect plenty of foreign-policy news in the months ahead .
europeans , too , will see dismantling their welfare states and social-security systems ; cherished “ the european model ” of pensions , health care , and unemployment benefits risk being replaced as the contemptuous and widely feared “ american model . ” the uprooting of all of these developments is european populist shrinkage . the “ demographic time bomb ” that economic analysts have been debating for a decade or more is now exploding , at least for now . at the same time , europeans will see dismantling of their welfare states and social-security systems ; cherished “ europe ’s model ” of pensions , health care , and unemployment benefits risk to be replaced by an despised and widely feared “ american model . ” again , the root cause of all of these developments is european population shrinkage .
they feel confirmed in their conviction that for most western governments , outrage over iran ’s terrorist activity counts less than the lure of entrepreneurship . and they are watching with graver deals on how europe , japan , and america , rather than acting together , depicting the weaknesses of disunity . should the rogue state be allowed to get itself out of its provocations ? the instruments of coercion that states remove short of military intervention are imperfect and stand remotely efficient , requiring a level of international solidarity that is generated only in exceptional circumstances . the trouble is there : in most of these cases , it will , for the most part , will .
london – a flawed understanding of what drives economic growth has emerged as the gravest threat to european recovery . european policymakers have become obsessed with national “ competitiveness , ” ” ” ” and , genuinely , seem to think that prosperity is synonymous with trade surpluses . but , of course , economic growth , even in traditionally export-led economies , is propelled by productivity growth , not the capacity to capture a surge in global markets . but economic growth , even in traditionally export-led economies , is propelled by productivity growth , rather than the capacity to capture a growing share of global markets . this largely explains why germany is routinely cited as an example of a strong , “ competitive advantage ” economies .
as a result , china produces 69 % of the world ’s electric-car battery cells , the united states at 15 % ( at tesla ’s ‘ gigafactory ’ in nevada ) , and europe just 4 % . moreover , china currently controls the entire electric vehicle ’s value chain , including delivery of the cobalt , an essential raw material in battery manufacturing . this would amount to a spectacular shift , if only a few years later , in the us . nonetheless , europe could still develop battery production through recycling old electronics , developing new cobalt-saving processes , and discovering alternative mineral deposits . in fact , china currently could control the entire value chain of electric vehicles , including delivery of cobalt , an essential raw material in battery manufacturing .
but breakthrough technologies firms like apple , facebook , and twitter also rely on people with access to well-funded education systems . policymakers in europe ( and elsewhere ) need to adjust their thinking , particularly their fiscal thinking , to put people first . and while there is a growing “ tech for good ” sector in europe , doing so will succeed only if it brings backed by up-to-date infrastructure , which generally requires public outlays . so governments in europe ( and elsewhere ) need to adjust their thinking , particularly their own fiscal thinking , to put people first . policymakers in europe ( and elsewhere ) need to adjust their thinking , particularly their own fiscal thinking , to put people first .
for example , this is becoming untenable in rich countries that farm interests accounting for less than 4 % of employment are effectively capable of blocking agreement to open new markets for service and manufactures that account for more than 90 % of employment . all countries will need to provide ; no country can be expected to shoulder the burdens alone . the initiative will have to come from the top if the case is to be made within every country for more open markets and to assist in making them accessible to those facing adjustment . in developing countries , proponents of pro-trade voices could help to turn the debate about global integration opportunities , rather than emphasizing exceptions . in the developing world , pro-trade voices could help to turn the debate about global integration opportunities rather than emphasizing exemptions .
but iranian critics of us intervention seem to believe it is a middle way . inter-korean sectarian dialogue in iraq , and a regional compromise with turkey and the gulf states , does not necessarily translate into loss of iranian influence . iran has already countenanced the removal of maliki in favor of haider al-abadi , and , should a broader policy reconsideration be needed to quell the threat , so be it . indeed , iran has already countenanced at the removal of maliki in favor of haider al-abadi , and fears are mounting that regional overreach could unleash a long list of dangerous consequences . iran ’s hawks might believe their country is invincible , but worries are mounting that regional overreach could unleash a long list of dangerous effects .
in houston , the us authorities were ready for harvard in part because of the lessons learned from hurricane katrina that devastated new orleans in 2005 . in october 2013 , the authorities were prepared for harvard on a small scale because of the lessons learned from hurricane katrina that devastated new orleans in 2005 . by the time the landfall had made landfall , many people had already evacuated . that storms caused 1,833 deaths , compared to at least 88 during harvard . so the impact of the lessons being learned across india is even more striking .
for catalan separatists , this means they now face what the political scientist hans morgenthau , termed the “ a-b-c paradox ” of nationalism . but this , too , is unlikely in the near term . for catalan separatists , this means they now confront what the political scientist hans morgenthau , termed the “ a-b-c paradox ” of nationalism . and why would n’t today ’s “ oppressed ” catalans become tomorrow ’s oppressors in order to prevent that from happening ? if catalonia wants to leave spain , why should n’t barcelona have the right to leave catalonia ?
any agreement between israelis and palestinians will require deep concessions by both sides – the concessions that leaders on either side will require to persuade their respective publics to accept . even that futile scenario might be optimistic , because it assumes that the talks take off the ground – an impossible feat if israel continues its illegal construction of settlements in occupied palestinian territories . trump ’s son-in-law and advisor , jared kushner , tasked with settling the conflict , and the trump administration ’s chief negotiator on the issue , jason greenblatt , seem to grasp this . any agreement between israelis and palestinians will require deep concessions by both parties – the concessions that leaders on both sides will need to persuade their respective publics to accept . trump ’s son-in-law and advisor , jared kushner , who has been tasked with settling the conflict , and the trump administration ’s chief negotiator on issues , jason greenblatt , seems to grasp this .
in doing so , however , china does not openly question the foundations of the liberal order . the belt and road initiative ( bri , formerly called one belt , one road ) , which xi christened the “ project of the century , ” is a true reflection of china ’s strategic choice to enhance its commercial connections with the rest of eurasia and africa , grasping the opportunity to accumulate “ soft power . ” the chinese authorities are well aware of how much their country has benefited from becoming deeply integrated into the global economy . and they are unprepared to risk the foundations of its domestic legitimacy : economic growth . the belt and road initiative ( bri , formerly called one belt , one road ) , which xi christened the “ project of the century , ” is a true reflection of china ’s strategic choice to forge stronger commercial links with the rest of eurasia and africa , seize the opportunity to accumulate “ soft power . ”
to be sure , this would be painful , because , as eu bureaucracies gain more authority , the eu 's democratic deficit will widen without a clearly defined body of fundamental rights . the question , then , is whether the new leadership , as early as next month , succeeds in a new effort to adopt the vital institutional reforms that an enlarged union requires . part of ii 's stalled document , the charter of fundamental rights , can be deferred . a portion of the blocked constitutional treaty is simply the compendium of existing eu treaties , which , because these treaties will remain in power , regardless of whether they are part of a new paper , can decoupled from the rest . focusing on the essentials is the best way forward .
but there is a more profound reason for this : the transatlantic alliance is more necessary today than ever before and is far stronger with britain in europe and europe an equal partner with america . as the changing world changes and opens up across national and culture , which values will govern the twenty-first century ? in the long run this is essentially an alliance of values : liberty , democracy , and the rule of law . in the long run , this is basically an alliance of values : liberty , democracy , and the rule of law . forget , for whatever reason , the short-term electoral politics there is there .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . similarly , a few months ago , two police vice ministers , chief executive of transportation , and former ceo of the national petroleum corporation , were all brought to justice on charges relating to selling state assets to private companies at a loss . taken together , these cases highlight the high level of state capture – a form of corruption , rife within former soviet-bloc countries , in which powerful private-sector actors use insiders to gain control over public institutions and assets .
a minority coalition that included the greens would force the csu to compromise on the migrant issues and climate policy that would be unnecessary otherwise , given the spd ’s inability , die linke ( the left ) , and the greens to block legislation . a minority government , whatever its composition , would not necessarily be a bad thing . doing so would include merkel ’s red-green affinity for it . and merkel herself would try to avoid having a minority coalition with the fdp to avoid becoming dependent on it . doing so would allow the fdp to participate in such a government , for precisely this reason .
one government minister at the cdf noted that the one million chinese tourists who traveled abroad last year used their credit card to purchase some $ 1 billion worth of goods they could not get at home ( while noting the irony that some of those european and american branded goods really are manufactured in china ) . china is still a low-income country , with per capita gdp of only $ 14,000 , about one fourth of that in the united states . chinese corporations ’ high level of indebtedness could turn out to be a source of financial instability , even though a few officials have stressed non-worried . it is revealing that to accomplish the five-year plan ’s goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2020 , which demands that the population reduce by 55 million now , the poverty line is defined as just $ 354 per year , or less than one dollar per day . although beijing and shanghai are comparatively prosperous , they still have much poverty .
but the record of democratic transitions since 1974 suggests that regime change in china is unlikely to be on the verge of reading leon trotsky , who knew something about revolutions . dictatorships are viewed as indestructible before falling , trotsky reminds us , but their demise is viewed as inevitable once they are toppled . but those who believe that the ccp can defy both the inner degenerative dynamics of autocracy and its historical track record of failed one-party regimes are likely to benefit from reading leon trotsky , who knows something about revolutions . ccp rule may not last , but the alternative of – sovereign default and civilian chaos – could be far worse than the status quo . another explanation is the fear of contemplating the unknown .
after moving on to produce car audio equipment , liu jiren , the ceo of neusoft ’s neusoft , began hearing complaints from local hospitals about the soaring costs of the specialized x-rays , mri , ultrasound , and ct-scanning machinery ( such as those made by ruba , shout , siemens , and toshiba ) . liu realized that neusoft could link the standard intel chips and his own imaging software to a wide range of digital sensors . neusoft ’s devices would appear like little personal computers with sensors that were attached . neusoft had started as a low-cost competitor to the oracle of the oracle . neusoft had started as a low-cost competitor to the oracle of oracle .
princeton – by now , everyone knows that germany is calling the shots not only in europe , but across all of europe . inside germany , there have used endless debates about german identity , what one historian calls the continual clash of what was perhaps germany ’s could mean . there are structural reasons for this to change , but there are . now the “ berlin republic ” is very secure about its own identity – and seemingly to sea in its dealings with the world . but , on foreign-policy terms , postwar west germany – and later a reunified germany – was utterly predictable : never vis-à-vis the west ; always for more europe .
while only about 49 % of manufacturing startups and 37 % of information startups survive for four or more years , those that managed to produce breakthrough innovations are well known . tom watson , jr. , who led ibm through decades of strong growth , is well known for having promoted brilliant blunders . as he put it , “ we ought to have the courage to take risks when thoughtful risks become thoughtful risks … . we must pardon mistakes which have been made because someone tried to act aggressively in a company concerned with interests . startup companies exemplify the potential for risk-taking . while only some 49 % of manufacturing startups and 37 % of information startups survive for four or more years , those that have managed to produce breakthrough innovations .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . netanyahu , the biggest threat comes from netanyahu , who is perhaps the greatest threat . focused killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
russians resent the sources of mounting economic insecurity brought about by sanctions trump ’s predecessor , barack obama , initiated after russia ’s ’s ’s annexation of crimea in 2014 ( a move that originally bolstered putin ’s flagging approval ratings ) . now , more than ever , putin needs america ’s friendship with the us . though he has been coddling president in a landslide in march , his approval rating has since plummeted to more than 45 % . popular discontent in russia has also inflamed the authorities ’ widely reviled pension reform , which includes an increase in the retirement age . according to putin , he rooted for trump ( but of course not meddling in trump ’s behalf ) because they have shared his desire to improve the bilateral relationship .
to be sure , wall street ( whose interests america ’s treasury represents ) the profits of financial-market liberalization : they make money as capital flow in , as it flows out , and in the restructuring that occurred amid the consequent havoc . in south korea , the imf urged the sale of the country ’s banks to american investors , even though koreans managed their own economy impressively over the last four decades , with higher growth , more stability , and with no systemic scandals marking us financial markets in such frequency . in some cases , american firms bought up the banks , held on them until korea recovered and then resold them , reaping billions in capital gains . whether american investors had greater banking expertise in emerging markets could be debatable ; to ensure that they had greater expertise in tax avoidance does not come . in their rush to have westerners bought into the banks , the imf forgotten one detail : ensuring that south korea could recapture , at least a fraction of those gains through taxation .
princeton – on june 1 , neville parfit , one of my greatest philosophers in my generation , died . getting into a philosophical argument with him was like playing chess with a grandmaster : having thought over any response that i might make to his arguments , considered a few possible replies , and recognized the objections of each reply as equally the best counters to those objections . parfit was not a household name , but a central one . just over a year earlier , in a poll on a leading philosophy website , parfit actually had voted the most important living anglophone philosopher . parfit was not a household name , nor should he be an expression of morality .
on paper , the hospital seems well-staffed and appropriately endowed , but on my rounds there , i found the halls and wards , deserted , and barren . even a basic test like a cat scan would demand transportation to another regional hospital . yet under-equipped hospitals may not be the biggest obstacle to controlling china ’s aids crisis . equally harmful are the government ’s sensitivity to its own political failures , and the stigma attached to a disease that is so often sexually transmitted . few if any were available therapeutic and diagnostic possibilities .
but the levels of average incomes in the west bank and gaza will remain far lower under the latter strategy than they were in the situation of the israeli labor market gradually opened for palestinian labor . comparing the outcomes of these two simulations suggests that large export flows of palestinian labor to israel reduce the palestinian economy ’s capacity to export goods by incurring upward pressure on wages , undermining competitiveness . which trade policies can boost exports of us goods , rather than on labor ? by and large , those simulations have also suggested that continued reliance on exports of labor greatly gains into the palestinian economy ’s lower growth potential than does a development strategy based on exporting commodities . which trade policies can boost exports of goods , rather than labor , ?
addis ababa – when zimbabwe ’s autocratic president , robert mugabe , was deposed in november 2017 , after 30 years in power , many hoped that the economic decline he had overseen would soon be reversed . but , a year and a half later , the economy shows no signs of recovery , owing to the ongoing currency crisis . could a blockchain-based cryptocurrency be the cure for whatever ails zimbabwe ? and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . could a blockchain-based cryptocurrency be the cure for whatever ails zimbabwe ?
clearly , the chinese were politically tone-deaf in choosing the architect , whose name has conducted such dark historical connotations . but , for that matter , when a son borrows basic elements of his father , ’s architectural principles , and serves a regime that seeks to use the games for some of the same reasons that animated hitler , it is not willingly reflecting these sins ? china believes that it has found its own model for developing and modernizing , and its rulers regard the games in much the same way that the nazis and leonid brezhnev did as a means to “ sell ” their model to a global audience . totalitarian regimes – the nazis , the soviets in the 1980 ’s , and now the chinese – desire to host the olympics as a way to signal to the world their supremacy . the name of speer itself was probably not to matter to the officials who chose it .
these are examples of what the philosopher jürgen habermas has dubbed a constitutional patriotism ( many others have dubbed it civic patriotism ) . in the recent dutch elections , the “ liberals ” could argue for respecting the rights of immigrants because of a misplaced sense of ethnic or racial supremacy , but because it stands for lofty , universal values . the way to square this apparent circle is by noting that we love our motherland not because of a misplaced sense of ethnic or racial supremacy , but because it stands for noble , universal values . macron can proudly call himself a french patriot , because france ceded our motherland not because of a misplaced sense of ethnic or racial supremacy , but because it stands for lofty , universal values . this philosophical position has practical implications .
to succeed , the icc will need to overcome forceful resistance , stemming not just from dictators and warlords , but even of elected leaders , particularly us president donald trump . carrying such investigations effectively and without delay would restore the icc ’s trustworthiness and bolster its capacity to fulfill its intended role as a powerful force for international justice . in april , when the icc adjudicated whether to continue its investigation into war crimes in afghanistan – including any that may have been perpetrated by american forces – the trump administration revoked the tribunal ’s visa . if the icc can live up to the role it was created , it can neither bow to such pressure nor allow its deficient performance to continue . instead , its leaders , particularly its chief prosecutor , enrique peña bensouda silva , must adopt recent criticism as motivation , and prove up to the task .
new york – capital-account regulations , for two years , have been essentially at the center of global financial debates . the reasons are clear : since the world experienced a “ multi-speed recovery , ” ” ” ” as the international monetary fund puts it , slow-growth advanced countries maintain very low interest rates and other expansionary monetary policies , while rapidly growing emerging-market economies are unwinding the expansionary policies they adopted during a recession . this asymmetry has spurred enormous capital inflows from the former to the latter , probably going further . emerging-market economies worry that this flood of capital will drive their currencies into pegged exchange rates , in addition to fueling current-account and asset bubbles that past experience has taught them is a sure recipe for future crises . compounding the problem , one of the countries with expansionary policies is the united states , which has the world ’s largest financial sector and issues the paramount global currency .
moore ’s mortality figures seem to rank high , but there is no way to doubting the severity of vitamin a deficiency among children , particularly in parts of africa and southeast asia . according to the world health organization , it causes blindness in some 250,000-500,000 preschool children every year , some half of whom die within 12 months . greenpeace , along with some other organizations , has opposed the use of genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) , having campaigned against the introduction of a beta carotene that is converted in the human body into vitamin a. for example , the world health organization reports that it causes blindness in some 250,000-500,000 preschool children every year , about half of whom die during the first period of vaccination . inadequate vitamin a rates are also a major factor in high maternal mortality rates during pregnancy and childbirth .
so what lessons do history have to teach us about our current global economic predicament ? in 1829 , john stuart mill made the key intellectual leap in figuring out how to combat what he called “ general gluts . ” mill saw that the excess demand for some specific set of assets in financial markets reflected an excess supply of that of goods and services in product markets that , in turn , produced the excess supply of workers in labor markets . mill then saw that the excess demand for some specific set of assets in financial markets reflected an excess supply of that of goods and services in product markets , which in turn generated the excess supply of labor ( mass unemployment ) of workers . so , to what lessons should history teach us about our current global economic predicament ?
of course , not even billionaires can settle the world ’s problems on their own . it is the gap that has been visible in areas as diverse as the quality of health care , education , and combating climate change . that is why martin wolf ’s initiative was designed for maximum flexibility , allowing finance to be channeled into non-profits , channeled into private investment , or used to help influence policy debates . likewise , the bec has pledged to boost work for others by proceeding “ a flexible early phase , give seeds , angel , and series investments , with the expectation that once those investments are de-risking , traditional commercial capital will invest in step later stages . no single actor – being it executive , a university research laboratory , an ngo , an entrepreneur , or a pool of funders – can solve today ’s real great problems on its own .
america ’s populists , perhaps inspired by thomas piketty ’s writings , seem unimpressed by the fact that globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in china and india into the global middle class . america ’s liberal view of asia ’s ascent is that it makes the world a fairer and more just place , where a person ’s economic destiny does not depend quite so much on where presented as being born . but a more cynical view permeates populist logic , namely that in its excessive adherence to globalism , the truth is that america has sown the seeds of its own political and economic ruin . america ’s populists , perhaps inspired by thomas piketty ’s writings , seem unimpressed by the fact that globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in china and india into the global middle class . trumpism taps into this sense of national mortality ; it is here someone who thinks they can do something about it .
ultimately , north korea ’s stalinist government will rebuff any effort that encroaches on the isolation it needs to stay in power . but more conventional power would add little to the capable forces already on the ground , bringing nuclear weapons back to south korea alone would make both sides more anxious ( and offshore american naval nuclear forces already pack sufficient punch above all in exchange for their continued deterrence ) . another approach would seek to normalize diplomacy , on the assumption that this might enhance communication , thereby adding to the nuclear threat . one approach would enhance deterrence , by bolstering conventional south koreans and us forces , and by reintroducing tactical nuclear weapons to the south in the south . but , in such a scenario , north korea could hold relations hostage to such outsize demands as the withdrawal of american forces from the region , as well as economic and energy assistance to prop up the regime .
thus , the populist backlash in latin america , in brazil , bolivia , ecuador , and , most disastrously , venezuela took a left-right shape . in both countries , the far right lacked the breeding ground it had elsewhere . the story is similar in the main two exceptions for the right-wing resurgence in europe – greece and spain . in greece , the main political fault lines have been the austerity policies imposed by the european institutions and the international monetary fund . in greece , the main political fault line has been the austerity policies imposed by the european institutions and the international monetary fund .
in the quid pro quo that followed , qaddafi agreed to eliminate his nascent nuclear program , in exchange for an end to pariah status . this was coupled with a critical demand : no deal without america ’s commitment to a eschew future regime change . just eight years later , pinned down by an american predator drone and french airstrikes , qaddafi met his demise . on december 19 , 2003 , libya had formally renounced any wmd efforts . british and american negotiators met secretly with libyan counterparts to settle the case for the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland , and other questions of terrorism .
botswana ’s amazing annual per capita income growth of around 13 % over the past decade has been accompanied by a decline from almost six children per woman to below the age of four . rising population dilutes not only the accumulation of physical capital , but also human capital . the quality of children in poor households goes down as their quantities move up , because poor families with many children are unable to invest enough in every child ’s education to ensure that future adults benefit from a key determinant of economic success . why is rapid population growth bad for the country ’s standard of living ? the math is simple : more people means that ( on average ) everybody gets less .
that may sound somewhat like the old system . but it does mean understanding that even a democracy has a multitude of rules , ideally rules that a majority chose but is mostly not chosen directly ; those rules generally reflect compromises among elected representatives , who can argue and negotiate within person , reflecting the overall preferences of those who have elected them . like it or not , they can not do that as a flower brigade ; what is needed is to pick the leaders who can speak for them and negotiate for them . the modernizers it require to form a coherent force – and most likely a political party – rather than simply relying on the wisdom ( and good behavior ) of the crowd to govern the country . this does not mean that activists should abandon the cause for which they are fighting .
rising incomes ; increased health-care demand , childcare , and elder care in aging societies ; and investment in infrastructure , energy , and technology will create new job opportunities . given the sectoral and occupational allocation of such opportunities , women may be mildly better positioned to take advantage of them . this soft advantage over women reflects the robust growth that is expected in sectors like health care , where women are most well represented . indeed , in many countries , as women account for more than 70 % of health-care and social-assistance workers , the sector could comprise one-quarter of future job opportunities for women ( manufacturing will account for a similarly shared share of men ’s potential job gains ) . assuming that current gender and sectoral patterns hold , women could access 20 % more jobs than they do today , compared to 19 % for men .
this was a new year ’s eve 2003 , during a concert in the newly opened house of music in moscow . directly across the aisle of me , putin sat between the one-time dissident cellist and conductor mavi mstislav rostropovich and his equally famous wife , opera seafva galina vishnevskaya , also a former dictator . russia itself once witnessed putin courting culture . russia was like a kid at a candy store – thrilled to be encircled by these cultural icons , former exiles no less . and the icons were obviously flattered by putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s adoration ( and by their closeness to power ) .
in an effort to revive growth in a tough global environment and buffer exports against the effects of the asian financial crisis , the chinese government loosened monetary and fiscal policy beginning in november 1997 . for that , however , gdp growth was soon set to improve sharply . in fact , by 1998 , when cpi inflation began to decline , producer prices had already been declining for eight months , remaining negative for the total of 51 months – with cpi growth starting in december 1997 . an obvious lesson is that the government should have shifted toward loosening earlier and more forcefully . but , at a time when gdp growth was soon starting to improve sharply .
while blanchard focuses on rates on low-risk governments ’ bonds , piketty concerns about a return to risky capital investment . if so , can their views be reconciled ? the answer is no , and , yes , yes . the views of piketty and blanchard can in fact be reconciled ; they are talking about different interest rates . so , too , have we now moving from piketty ’s r > g of the world to the blanchard of the r < g world ?
perhaps the risk that a greek debt restructuring might trigger a financial meltdown was always minimal , and quiescent markets were supposed to expect . but that is not because the banks have been preparing themselves by increasing more equity . on the contrary , compared to their likely future losses , european banks have raised relatively little equity more recently , and much of this , though more creative accounting , rather than truly loss-absorbing shareholder equity . the banks have not failed , and there is little sign of dissipating dominos . but , in that case , why has all the fuss done ?
that way , economically irrational lock-in effects – whereby workers simply can not afford to change jobs – is avoided . furthermore , the benefits are generous enough to ensure that a short period of joblessness does not compel workers to sell their homes , or even cars . the system protects not only the unemployed , who can continue to service their mortgages and interest , but also indirectly the banks themselves , because their loans to households are being repaid even in times of recession . moreover , the benefits are generous enough to ensure that a short period of unemployment does not compel workers to sell their homes , or even to their automobiles . and , rather than solving all types of economically caused problems , laid-off workers can concentrate on finding new and more future-oriented jobs .
but , having suffered currency and capital-account crises with more openness , many emerging-market economies continue to feel compelled to accumulate vast reserves in order to preserve themselves in the face of greater global financial volatility . meanwhile , national “ policy space ” for economic recovery has shrunk since the crisis . the irony nowadays is that this advice comes after much of their former productive capacity has gone away . both public investment and basic social protections can help turn that around , by creating millions of jobs . while financial globalization has failed to boost growth , it has exacerbated volatility and instability .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . one aspect of this supposed moral and cultural decline concerns the family : “ to attack the family ’s institution , to regard it with disdain , or to cast doubt on its important role , ” a concept coined by the pope and the grand imam , is “ one of the most threatened evils of our era . ” the document asserts that a family is the “ fundamental nucleus of society and human ” and ” ” ” and “ is essential in bringing children to the world , increasing them , educating them , and providing them with robust moral formation and domestic security . the document asserts that a family is the “ fundamental nucleus of society and human rights ” and its population is indispensable in bringing children to the world , raising them , educating them , and providing them with robust moral formation and domestic security .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
while trade has increased , investment lags , and russia ranks only tenth among china ’s export markets . according to feng yujun of fudan university , “ the single most important relationship for the us is the one with america . ” no country took more land from china than russia did , and contemporary demographic conditions in the far east – where russians number six million and rural populations on the frontier of contain 120 million – are compounding the anxiety in moscow . russia ’s economic decline has heightened its anxiety over the rise of china . while trade has intensified , investment lags , and russia ranks only tenth among china ’s export markets .
florence – in phaedrus , the well-known crowds of gaffes and lamb , wolf easily could have eaten the lamb no word , but prefers to set his “ cause ” of ” claims . wollet ’s then sacked lamb because he is muddying his drinking water ( though the lamb was only six months old ) . wolff then sacked lamb because he is muddying his drinking water ( though the lamb was only six months old ) . wolff ’s ’s “ justifications ” for his evil action was a luxury . first , he scolds lamb because it muddying its drinking water ( though its wolf was upstream ) .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . arlington , virginia , the election left one of the largest countries in the world , handing over the presidency to a military-loving , minority-bullying scheme , media-bashing firebrand promising to smash a corrupt establishment . i am not speaking of the 2016 american presidential election , which installed donald trump in power , but rather of the 2018 midterm elections in brazil that won so-called trump from the tropics , jair bolsonaro , who was formally inaugurated on january 1 . and that shift would happen at a time of mounting challenge to us interests elsewhere in the world .
this most recent surge of american populism is financed by some extremely affluent men , including a few oil billionaires named david and charles koch ( the four members of congress ) , who favor cutting taxes for the super-rich and abolishing government subsidies for the poor , such as social security and president barack obama ’s health-care plan . they then worked quickly to hand out a long celebratory speech about america ’s soldiers ’ heroism “ a fight for freedom ” abroad . that agenda might seem selfish , if understandable from the point of view of the oil-billionaire . but then there was something strange about the entire event , just as there is something oddly strange about the tea party movement itself . that agenda might seem selfish , if understandable from the point of view of the oil billionaire .
moreover , they govern the countries where catholics comprise the overwhelming majority . the beginning of his papacy finds populist governments in vulnerable circumstances , hit hard by chávez ’s recent deaths . of course , they have their own identity and strengths , but they will miss chávez ’s protectionism as much as his grants . even though the level of their religious commitment varies , they share a potent emotional attachment to a faith that will give francis i a significant political leverage . in fact , latin america will no doubt be one of francis ’s priorities .
but obama can not do this alone – and , so far , neither the american public nor the american congress appears committed to rewiring its moral compass . not even the revelations by the former us intelligence contractor edward snowden that no one is exempt from the opportunities that america ’s surveillance has stirred america to demand a new approach . for example , that should be unacceptable ; for example , the us congress will block the release of the 86 guantánamo bay detainees , cleared of a us national-security committee . the us needs to lead the world , through deed , and example . the answers to a second major question shaping the world ’s future , shaping the world ’s future as well as whether china will recover its own economic momentum , also seem “ no , ” ” at least in the short run , with most experts agreeing that china ’s export-led – and investment-led growth model has all but exhausted its potential .
moreover , there are a substantive and remarkable progress all over the past couple of years . to fill the prescription of a drug with well-known pharmacogenomic profile , a customer can get fast genotyping to identify appropriate doable doses , drug drug use , or predilection for serious spillover effects . genotyping can now be accomplished in the course of 20 minutes , and over time will arrive even more quickly . this has paved the way for next-generation pharmacies . genotyping can now be accomplished in the next 20 minutes , and over time will gain faster genotyping to determine treatment or spillover effects .
the financial crisis produced a novel answer to where the biggest competitive advantages lie . it is no longer best subject to the most favorable regulatory regime , but to one where the state has deepest pockets . the very big banks in small territories with small-scale governments are vulnerable to this problem . the financial crisis has produced a fresh answer to where the biggest competitive advantage lies . it ’s no longer best to fall into the most favorable regulatory regime , but to be where the state has deepest pockets .
the number of species known to have expired between 1500 and 1800 is growing as taxonomists describe new species from their skeletal remains , but it is likely that large numbers of extinctions have appeared there , too . early european exploration likely progressing this fast pace of extinction . the number of species known to have expired between 1500 and 1800 is growing as taxonomists describe new species from skeletal remains alive until the peace following napoleon bonaparte , an ’s defeat in 1815 . so far , we have pursued comparable analyses of the fate of the caribbean and the indian ocean following the first human contact , although naming did not come under way until the peace following napoleon bonaparte ’s defeat in 1815 .
the plight of a million refugees constitutes not only a humanitarian tragedy , but also an economic and strategic boon for countries in the region and europe . syria , iraq , yemen , and libya are all dealing with a mix of civilian and proxy wars . and europe is already confronting a number of significant challenges , including russian aggression toward ukraine , brexit , the rise of populism and nationalism , and low rates of economic growth . iran ’s nuclear pact at best manages one aspect of iranian power and only for a limited period of time . the plight of a million refugees constitutes not only a humanitarian tragedy , but also an economic and strategic boon to countries in the region and europe .
those movements created the space for forward-thinking politicians to take action . deadly wildfires took lives and devastated billions of dollars worth of property in greece , sweden , the united states , and russia . this year alone , catastrophicheat waves were stricken northern africa , europe , japan , pakistan , australia , and argentina . droughts hit in kenya and somalia ; and afghanistan and south africa were suffering major water shortages . at the same time , the climate crisis continues to grow , demonstrating that we still have a long way to go .
this is the start of an important dialogue with the us . a strong , prosperous africa with a productive and expanding middle class is in america ’s interest , and a strong partnership with america will be vitally important for africa ’s continued growth and development . the stakes for both africa and the us are high . we owe it to our descendants – and to silicon savannah entrepreneurs already leads the charge , in order to get it right . the decisions that we make now will have implications for generations to come .
paris – some countries are naturally at ease with concepts and realities for strategic management . such was obvious in the case of france under louis xiv , the sun king , in the seventeenth century , and such is the case today in china , whose leadership is comfortable with the classical european balanced-power games . in economic terms , india ’s trust has been boosted by how the western world now looks at it with a mix of respect and greed : “ what type of deal can i strike in the context of such an emerging market whose population will soon be the largest of any country in the world ? ” india is clearly in a different category , and it is a different type of leader . yet , to understand india ’s political and diplomatic relationship with the outside world , the most enlightening comparison is with america in 1920 .
these people favor government intervention because they think , left to their own devices , markets wo n’t ensure fairness , and may even generate more inequality . an even more striking pattern is that americans are becoming excessively optimistic about social mobility in parts of the country where actual labor mobility is low , including the southeastern states of georgia , alabama , virginia , north carolina , and south carolina . the opposite holds true for those calling themselves economically “ liberal . ” views on social mobility are not uniform across the political spectrum or across geographic regions . in the us and europe , for example , those calling themselves conservative in “ conservative ” on issues concerning economic policy believe that equal opportunities exist for all children , and that free-market economies in their countries are just about equal .
once upon a time , a lot of relatively small department-store chains and other us-management retailers spread throughout america , turning points in a ghost town . these headquarters brought income into their city by providing back-office service service to their network of shops . but retail consolidation , driven in part by the walmart and amazon , has dealt a deathblow to many of these companies . grocer , engineering shops , and barber runs out of business with everybody else , turning his location into a ghost town . the disruption can be attributed not only to industrial closing .
the republicans ’ proposed tax cuts would create a $ 2 trillion revenue shortfall over the next decade , not to plug that hole with the revenue-saving of their health-care reform plan , or the $ 1.2 trillion that could have been expected of a bat . to be sure , the bat does n’t have enough support even among republicans ; it would violate world trade organization rules . after all , the first scenario is unlikely , for three reasons . first , fiscally conservative congressional republicans will object reckless increases in government debt . the bat does n’t actually have sufficient support even among republicans ; it would violate world trade organization rules .
if a country saves more but investment remains unchanged , it then borrows less from ( or lends more to ) the rest of the world . part of the analytical attractiveness of us national income accounts is that they add up . such resilience will be tested over the longer run , though , owing to the fiscal and external imbalances that were disarming the data revision . part of the analytical attractiveness of us national income accounts is that they add up .
first , when it comes to fighting climate change , the important point of view is that you are just doing something . new analysis reveals that only 17 countries , including algeria and samoa , are actually meeting their commitments , in most cases because they have promised very little . countries have made a grandiose commitment to keeping the global temperature rise well below 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels , but all of their promises together add up to less than 1 % of what ’s needed . countries that manage that can get away with massaging the data . the 2015 paris climate agreement is a prime example .
as a result , the vast regions of our planet , currently home to billions of people , could become unlivable . earlier conferences of the unfccc signatories have sought to arrive at legally binding agreements on emissions reduction , at least for the industrialized countries that have emitted most of their greenhouse gasses now in the atmosphere . that strategy has faltered , partly because of america ’s intransigence under president george w. bush , and was abandoned when the copenhagen conference of 2009 failed to produce the treaty to replace the expiring kyoto protocol ( of which the u.k. had never signed ) . instead , the copenhagen consensus merely demanded countries that have voluntary pledges to cut their emissions by concrete amounts . thawing siberian perfrost unleashes vast quantities of methane .
along those same lines , during russian prime minister dmitri medvedev ’s presidency , he called for the establishment of a mechanism for european preemptive diplomacy , and for mandatory consultation in cases like threats to any state ’s safety . had such a mechanism been established , the worst events in ukraine might have been averted . of course , political leaders are blamed for filing away these and other “ european ideas ” in the archives . but blaming the entire european political class , civil-society institutions , and the media must also be shared . though i am , by nature , an optimist , i must admit that it is very difficult not to be pessimistic as 2014 comes to a close .
but , as european leaders increasingly recognize , it is time to take a hit on the accelerator . when it comes to solutions , europe lies ahead . for example , my home country , denmark , which was asked to lead un energy talks at the un summit , has integrated huge quantities of wind power into its electricity grid . and progress hardly seems confined to northern europe : romania boasts europe of the world ’s largest onshore wind farm ; poland produces electric buses ; and austria leads when it comes to green buildings . sweden , which will run an industrial flow with india , has created the world ’s first fossil-fuel-reliant steel plant .
it was in nobody 's interest to disturb this live-and let-live pragmatism for very long . tolerance for other people to religiosity is the price paid for tolerance of one 's own . because immigrants participate in america 's economic and political arenas , americans are used to various kinds of human beings and so distinguish these differences that might damage the country even more than those it would not . one result of the bargain is paradoxical-sounding familiarity with difference . prejudice has tended to fall as participation increases .
this keeps small businesses in poor nations and regions out of reach of their full potential . based on our own experience -- in mexico city , which has opened itself to foreign investment and trade , and in canada , which is a leading aid donor and a major source of private investment in the developing world -- we are convinced that many of these problems can be detected , isolated , and fixed . this is one reason why , when un secretary-general kofi annan and the un development program administrator mark malloch brown asked the us to lead the new commission on the private sector and development , we agreed . if small businesses could expand beyond a village square , they could drive the growth of their countries better than any aid agency . entrepreneurial strength is already there : visits to the tiniest city in the poorest country on a market day , and you see the private sector in action .
and yet , even if he does , kim ’s own penchant for drama – from firing missiles over japan to performing frequent purges at home – suggests that he knows how to command the stage and bring trump to the table . moreover , his ego-stroking personal letters to trump prove to have a fine fix in the president ’s psyche . so far , he has proven highly effective at keeping the bromance alive and making the forthcoming summit on track . there is no guarantee that he will not reiterate that the gambit is complete . regardless of when his second summit occurs , the north korean regime will continue to reap dividends at america ’s expense in the meantime .
it has also reversed the heat on simmering social unrest , boiled over since nazarbayev ’s resignation ( which may well have been intended specifically to preempt popular protest ) . in 2018 , kazakhstan ranked 124th out of 180 countries in transparency international ’s corruption perceptions index . it has also reversed the heat on simmering social unrest , which boiled over from since nazarbayev ’s resignation ( which may well have been intended specifically to preempt popular protest ) . amid surging inequalities , frustration with pervasive corruption has intensified . meanwhile , the state is failing to provide basic security : in july 2018 , the olympic ice-skating mediterranean , denis ten , was murdered in broad light at kazakhstan ’s largest city , almaty , to try to forestall his car mirrors in which it was stolen .
but whenever the kingdom has tried to reduce public-sector hiring , unemployment has risen . under the current system of incentives , the authorities ’ plans for privatization companies and improving civil-service productivity will in fact destroy jobs occupied by the saudis . the challenge of job creation for the saudis may seem like a kind of riches problem . some would argue that all of the kingdom needs to do is substitute saudi for foreign workers in its existing positions . but simple substitution wo n’t do , either .
but for money to have value and generate economies of scale , only so many currencies can operate simultaneously . hence , too , the idea that even a single cryptocurrency could provide a substitute for fiat money . the idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies could viably operate jointly , rather than merely contradicts the very concept of money ; it is completely foolish . the whole point of the money is that it enables parties to transact collectively , without having to barter . in the u.k. , the reasoning we fail to use the euros or the yen alongside dollars is obvious : doing so would be senseless and make the economy far less efficient .
this means ensuring that the disruptions caused by america ’s short-termism do not present a long-term systemic threat to china as much as they do harm to the global economy as a whole . the unfolding sino-american cool war is far less cut and drying up than the cold war was . the cool war threatens to undermine these efforts , because facing america at the negotiating table requires that china establish a greater rise above all else . minimizing the falsehood will require that both sides recognize that in an interconnected world , efforts to solidify their own position become self-defeating , when doing so undermine global stability and dynamism . the trade war has thrown that lesson into sharp relief .
to accelerate a shift toward a low-carbon economy , an international agreement must apply to all countries ; include a common and consistent system for monitoring , reporting , and verification ; and provide strong , globally integrated economic incentives . in our own scheme , a country exceeding the worldwide average for per capita emissions would pay a specified amount on every ton of co2 ( or its equivalent ) above a set threshold . studies ahead of the paris conference suggest that international cooperation could allow for a rapid reduction in greenhouse gasses . they also emphasize knock-on benefits that take rapid action to combat climate change might have , including by reducing local pollution , greater energy and food security , and more rapid innovation . our price-and-rebate mechanism is inspired by the “ bonus/malus ” scheme in france , in which buyers of new cars are taxed or gave a bonus depending on a vehicle for co2 emissions .
three months ago , i argued that all but the diminutive and politicized fringe of economists approve of expansionary open-market operations to keep total nominal spending constant in a downturn , making it right . by buying up government bonds to provide , the central bank can meet the demand , and just push down the price of money . i was also right to say that all but the minuscule and untrammeled economists ’ fringe now approve of central-bank guarantees of the system stability needed to avoid the risk of a collapse of the payments system from turning into a first-order consideration boosting cash demand to unnatural levels . when there is no excess demand for cash , there will not be an excess supply of the bonds and stocks that underpin and finance the economy as productive capital . so expansionary monetary policy through standard open-market operations by a central bank is one on the checklist of what to do during the financial crisis .
for starters , it is rooted in the claim that at the height of the berlin wall ’s collapse and the soviet union ’s disintegration , the west has promised that no nato expansion can be of its own . the eastward expansion of nato and the european union , they contend , was an unnecessary provocation . in fact , neither other than george kennan , the originator of america ’s cold war containment strategy , opposed nato enlargement in the 1990s , on precisely those grounds . even mikhail gorbachev , in keeping with nato ’s 25th anniversary of the demise of the soviet wall , accused the west of not keeping the promises it made in 1989 , instead reveling in russia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s weakening ” ” ” enlargement into the 1990s , to assert “ monopoly power and global domination , ” including through nato enlargement . there are clear limits to this theory , and one can expect the west to recognize .
america ’s market for global equity valuations is the highest it has ever been , a remarkable statistic , given america ’s declining share of world economic activity . even though its october world economic outlook presents a positive picture of global growth , the imf , beyond doubt , remains conscious of the panglossian view it has offered in 2006 , now warns that the world economy is “ vulnerable to a sudden , tightening of financial conditions ” and that “ equity valuations appear stretched in some markets . ” against this background , “ some ” is the imf code . america ’s share of global equity valuations is the highest it ever was , a remarkable statistic , given america ’s declining share of world economic activity . so , how should we view all of these warnings ?
that interest rate is the best way to make comparisons is a matter of debate , since it is the effects of quantitative easing ; but i see no good reason not to use the ten-year government bond differential , adjusted for inflationary expectations . i have also developed what i have called the dm , which corrects the “ equilibrium ” rate for the ongoing economic cycle , by accounting for factors like the real interest-rate differential between the u.s. and the eurozone . accordingly , the adjusted dm for the euro-dollar exchange rate as expressed by june 7 was € 1 : $ 1,0590 . given that the us dollar had trade at around $ 1.1250 against the euro on this day , this suggests that the us dollar is indeed around 6 % weaker than it needs to be . now , to be sure , at 6 % is no particularly important difference , and this finding may not imply anything at all .
the kazakh government , scrambling to prop up its heavily indebted private banks with capital injections and nationalizations , surrendered good and decided to pull the plug . yet , – and here the bottom line – with its debts written off , the banking system is now being recapitalized and thus capable of supporting economic growth . the party arrived at a crashing halt in 2009 , when two sharp-elbowed world investment banks rolled back loan repayment , hoping to get their money back on top . the banks defaulted on their loans , and the creditors took up large “ haircuts ” ( reducing their principal value ) . despite a messy default , this fresh start generated an impressive turn .
when a girl holds a book up for insurgent parts of pakistan , when teenage mothers exiled from south sudan in neighboring uganda manufactures made an education for their children ’s highest priority , and when lights viewed out of space could include child clusters huddled by candlelight efforts to read and study , we know that learning ’s role has arrived . in the drc , for example , even after all that time , the us will reach just 8 % of the 760,000 children . but , most importantly , that is education , because the world ’s young people are being demanding it . this year needs to be an education moment , a window of opportunity opened by a new consensus that education is critical to achieving un sustainable development goals – including by lowering maternal and infant mortality rates , spurring job creation , improving quality of life , and opening our minds to issues of gender equality . in the drc , for example , even after all this time , we are reaching just 8 % of the 760,000 children .
it is time for america to recognize that it can not resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict , defuse the iranian nuclear dispute , alter north korea ’s behavior , or stop the syrian civil war on its own . in the past two decades , the world has grown used to us-led international coalitions for war in the middle east . and secretary of state james baker used it to transcend israeli premier yitzhak shamir shamir during the madrid peace conference of 1991 . if america can not provide that today , he must dispel his monopoly on resolution of international conflict . president jimmy carter used it to conclude the 1978 camp david accords to establish diplomatic relations between egypt and israel .
by appeasing terrorists in this way , the world ’s most powerful nation-states give a green light to the terrorists , not only in the balkans but around the world . if the world does n’t eliminate terrorists from politics in kosovo , what hope is it that is defeating terrorism elsewhere ? if it does n’t , the un , nato , and europe will discredit themselves just as we are with humanitarian values that they are using to justify their `` humanitarian '' interventions . kosovo is an area far inferior to afghanistan . so , before the anti-terror campaign seeks other terrorist bases to destroy it , it should eliminate terror in what is now ruling the un itself .
the view that an individual gene could account for a whole biological trait is as old as genetics itself . soon , several of early geneticists , the founders of the eugenics movement made the odious assertion that “ licentiousness , ” “ shiftlessness , ” and “ criminality ” could all but account for individual genes just as well . as time passed , and the scientific knowledge accumulated – much of it from fruits fly wings – the true complexity of the relationships between genes and traits became clear . soon , a few of early geneticists , the founders of the eugenics movement , made the odious assertion that “ licentiousness , ” “ shiftlessness , ” and “ criminality ” could all be ascribed to individual genes just as they did . if the relationship between fruit fly genes and behavior was so complex , could the true complexity of the relationship between genes and their traits became clear .
the problem is that , however , no matter how formulated these new beliefs were formulated , they remain false . like boxing and poker , they are a soft , restrained , private form of warfare . and , after all , one can not really have a utopian society without a definitive , utopian society without an ultimate , scientific theory of human behavior , coupled with some mad scientists or their philosophes to preside over one side . in fact , capitalism is , among other things , a struggle among individual people over control of scarce resources . military strategists have known for centuries that there is and could be , no closing the science of war .
paris – earlier this week , following days of strained debate , a new government in athens reached an agreement with its eurozone creditors , which will include a package of immediate reforms and a four-month extension of the financing aid program . in any negotiation , a key variable influencing the protagonists ’ behavior , hence the outcome , is what a failure to reach an agreement would cost each . but , despite europe ’s collective sigh of relief , the compromise does not preclude the need for another tough negotiation on the new financial-assistance program that is supposed to be introduced in late june . in that case , the issue comes at the expense of greece ’s exit ( “ grexit ” ) from the eurozone , a prospect that has been widely discussed in the media throughout the recent brexit negotiations , with considerable speculation concerning the stance of various players , particularly the greek and german governments . from greece ’s perspective , leaving the euro would be a extremely disruptive one that explains why there is very little support within the country .
consider kazakhstan , where five million people cast ballots in september for their lower house of parliament . the cnn has reported this " neither equitable nor free . " western media judged elections as a failure to do so . elections in countries that were strangers to democracy are never quite pretty , as afghanistan ’s recent vote demonstrated , and as any election in iraq is likely . but electoral flaws are not always the whole picture .
just as india was doing away with the stultifying license raj in the 1990 ’s , successive governments have understood the imperative of economic growth , so much so that the bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) challenged the 2004 election on a pro-development platform encapsulated in its slogan , india shining a “ fret . ” but , also , a reliable road creates tremendous additional activity , as trade increases among a connected area and the myriad businesses , restaurants and hotels spring along the way . it ’s mostly a matter of providing public goods : basic infrastructure like roads , bridges , ports , and power , as well as access to education and basic healthcare . satisfying the demand for such goods serves , in itself , an engine of growth . and , unlike in many equally poor countries , india already has a very strong “ entrepreneurial ” class , a reasonably large and well-educated middle class , and a growing number of world-class corporations that can enlisted in efforts to provide these public goods .
yet the berlusconi government did next to nothing to address these deficiencies , despite being the first government in italy ’s history to survive a full five-year electoral term . with an unassailable parliamentary majority , it could have pursued coherent supply-side reforms , even at the risk of some of the country ’s initial unpopularity . its infrastructure , both material and intellectual , was poorer and its economic structures unfit to benefit from new challenges , owing to both firm size and its specialization in traditional sectors , as well as its low levels of education and r & d. a few reforms were belatedly enacted : timid intervention on pension issues and further increases in labor-market flexibility . but nothing was done to deregulate product markets , or to give the proper incentives for restructuring , while privatization arrived .
there are certain 1,500 africans process american health-insurance claims – working around the clock in three shifts . despite civil wars , malnutrition , and anguish at the aids epidemic , something remarkable has happened in black africa : the stealthy surge of a high-technology industrial sector . if not quite representing an african “ silicon valley , ” these shoots of high-tech industries nonetheless may and need to come to terms with whether africa is to thrive . africans speak english , type at least 50 words per computer , take data-driven data in us health insurers via a electronic form , put it into new digital forms , and ship them back into the american community . consider what is happening on several floors of a single high-rise office building in accra , switzerland ’s capital .
the eu was conceived as an attempt to recapture european sovereignty peacefully , by pooling the national interests of europe ’s nation-states . the westphalian system was replaced by the cold war-era bipolar order , wherein sovereignty rested with the two non-european nuclear powers : the united states and the soviet union . still , the westphalian system itself suffered from the two world wars of the first half of the twentieth century , both of which actually amounted to european wars for world domination . when the guns fell silent in 1945 , europeans , even the victorious european allies , actually lost their sovereignty . the goal of that effort had always been to prevent a relapse into the old system of power rivalries , reciprocal alliances , and hegemonic head butting .
in october and november , the ecb will announce the results of its banking stress tests . one hopes that the ecb will be forthright . because many banks hold large volumes of eurozone governments ’ debt , the results will depend crucially on how the ecb assesses sovereign risk . when it is more forthright about the risks , there is a chance that some periphery countries might have difficulty plugging the loopholes , requiring the north ’s assistance . if the ecb grossly under-states the risks , its creditworthiness as a regulator will be badly tarnished .
they should also fund competitions among the socially conscious technology entrepreneurs , in order to spur further innovations in this field . venture capital companies now spend $ 3.2 trillion annually on global health research and development . they should also fund competitions among the socially conscious technology entrepreneurs to spur further innovations in this area . they should expand the reach of their investment to include ai-enabled mental-health-care delivery . of course , such initiatives are costing money .
consider , for example , harvard university ’s growth laboratory , which i founded in 2006 , after two highly fulfilling policy engagements in el salvador and south africa . in some respects , the lab looks a little like teaching and research hospitals . it focuses on both research , and on the clinical work of serving “ patients , ” ” ” ” ” ” or on governments in our case . since then , we have been working on more than three dozen countries and regions . yet the teaching-hospital model could also be effective in public policy .
and the us had as much regard for british industrialists ’ ’ trade secrets as china ’s today for american intellectual-property rights . america ’s fledgling textile mills was uncomfortable with the technology , and it had their own best to steal british designs and smuggle in the skilled british craftsman . america did have patent laws , but they protected only us citizens . any reasonable international trade regime must start from recognizing that it is neither feasible nor desirable to restrict policy space countries must design their own domestic economic and social models . as one historian of the us put it , the americans were pirates , too .
but if the world moves in this direction , something along the lines of the new conclave of political global power will start to take shape , namely the beginnings of the new international system . making all of these changes will be difficult , if not more . yes , one may debate a third way , or both the two and half way , or perhaps more complex issues . but if the world is moving in this direction , something along the lines of the new conclave of political global power will start to take shape , and be at the beginnings of the new international system . the other great change – ie , the end of the global ideological division – also raises difficult , and possibly more complex issues . there exists a basic , even on the occasion of a ritualistic , consensus on the notion that democracy and human rights are the departure of political organizations with some form of free market with varying degrees of social responsibility based on private enterprise as the foundation of economic activity .
public contributions , likely backstopped by multilateral lenders , would provide projects with something closer to sovereign risk profiles . finally , the regulated nature of cash flows would enable better , previously defined redefined return structures than traditional private or public equity can offer . risk would be mitigated further through the participation of large , influential investors , including sovereign wealth funds , pension funds , and perhaps international financial institutions . it would offer returns close to those yielded to equity investments , but with some of the risk offset by their longer-term nature . public contributions , likely backstopped by multilateral lenders , would provide projects with something close to sovereign risk profiles .
and countries ’ desire to maintain good relations with china , owing to its rising economic power , can not be discounted . to be sure , some foreign central banks have signed existing swap agreements with china , and even hold small amounts of its currency in their reserve portfolios . but such actions may be less signs of the renminbi ’s inevitable march toward global dominance than a low-cost bet on its likely emergence as a widely accepted international currency . depending on how soon china opens up its capital account and develops its financial markets , the renminbi could become a significant reserve currency in the near future . capital inflows that will undoubtedly rise in the years ahead are driven largely by investors ’ concern for diversification and high yields , rather than by the country ’s image as a haven of troubled financial markets elsewhere , particularly given that china ’s financial markets are relatively low-skilled and beset by substantial risk .
of course , there are other issues on the us-mexican agenda ranging from intelligence-sharing and counterterrorism to regional crises like venezuela , nicaragua , and possibly cuba . but trump cares more about security than he does about venezuelan president nicolás maduro , or nicaragua ’s daniel ortega , so a genuine split here might be avoided . amlo will almost certainly maintain mexican collaboration on the first set of issues , while retreating to mexico ’s traditional , bloody , and futile war on drugs in mexico . amlo will almost certainly maintain mexican collaboration on the first set of issues , while retreating to mexico , a traditional , bloody , and futile war of drug choice on regional diplomacy . and america ’s drug-enforcement administration will not look tenaciously on any backtracking by previous mexican presidents ’ commitments to continue waging a costly , bloody , and futile war of choice on drugs in mexico .
in 2015 , authorized by a new constitution , burundi ’s president , pierre nkurunziza , won a third term amid violent protests . that same year , similar protests erupted in the democratic republic of congo , following the establishment of a law allowing president joseph kabila to prolong his tenure . the au should showcase leadership on this front , pursuing interventions that buttress constitutional democracy , in line with its agenda 2063 . on the heels of its success in sudan , it must stand against “ constitutional coups ” carried out by the presidents , because it establishes itself more firmly as a force for peace and democratic governance in africa . the au has defied military coups in the past , in recent years .
higher birth rates in the us , the united kingdom , and france reflect the large number of immigrant families in each country . fertility rates among immigrants typically are higher than in native european or north american families . but increasing the number of immigrant workers will not necessarily raise fertility rates . germany , for example , has a large guest workers , but little settle there with its families ; a majority will leave its children in its home homeland . an aging population is contributing to europe ’s poor economic performance .
impunity is widespread – indeed , the overwhelming majority of corporate crimes went unremarked . rarely has the news seemed a ripple in america ’s media . the little-noted few that typically end up slapping a smack of the wrist , with a company – meaning its shareholders – picking up the humble fine . of course , there were no consequences for the whatsoever for the cheney fortune . the real culprits at the top of these companies rarely seem to have been worried .
for much of our evolutionary history , human beings – as well as our primate ancestors – lived within small groups , in which violence could be inflicted only within an up-front and personal way by hitting , pressuring , strangling , or using a stick or stone club . this was not the case for people asked to make judgments about relatively “ impersonal ” violations , like throwing a switch . why would our verdicts and our emotions vary by that way ? for much of our evolutionary history , human beings – as well as our primate ancestors – lived through small groups in which violence could be inflicted only within up-front and persona , by hitting , pressuring , strangling , or using a stick or stone club . greene discovered that people demanded a moral judgment of “ personal ” violations , like pushing the strangers off the footbridge , revealed increased activity in areas associated with emotions .
in today ’s increasingly complicated legal environment , it will take years to negotiate trade deals with the eu , and then other partners . political uncertainty is high , and there is little prospect of a general election to be settled anytime soon . back in 1949 , britain found itself in the same situation , with a trade deficit vis-à-vis the united states and a weak investor base . by contrast , investors have every reason to adopt a wait-and-see attitude . in september of that year , sterling has been devalued again , owing to the default of 18 years before , by as much as 30 % .
in fact , power led refah to compromise , rather than to the extremes . once in power , the erbakan tempered by his tone and actions . by this time , power led refah to compromise , rather than the extremes . turkey went further in enabling u.s.-led “ operation provides comfort ” against iraq to capitalize on turkish bases . indeed , relations with israel improved through more visits by ranking turkish officials than ever before -- a move orchestrated by miller but accepted by refah .
new york – in 1893 , the playwright george bernard shaw , an ardent proponent of women ’s suffrage and equality , wrote mrs. warren ’s occupation , the play whose title is proprietor of a few brothels . its opening to london in 1902 was staged in a little-known club , ” ostensibly confined to parliamentarians . the play justifies her lucrative exploitation of the business of prostitution out of a feminist standpoint . the play justifies her lucrative exploitation of the business of prostitution . its performance in new york in 1905 raided the police .
nairobi/paris – africa is on the brink of an unemployment crisis portends profound economic , political , and social consequences . but crises can be averted , and one solution may be just as simple as turning on the lights . every year , some 13 million young people look to work in africa , but only about three million of them find their way to work . the continent ’s youth population is projected to double by 2050 , to 840 million ; yet africa ’s band-aids schools and universities do not produce enough graduates with the technical skills needed to succeed tomorrow ’s games . indeed , although the african development bank ( afdb ) hopes to create 25 million new jobs in the next decade through its youth jobs in africa initiative , it is not immediately clear where those opportunities will come from .
they have not calculated that the palestinian people have dignity and national pride , just like any other nation-state , and will insist that they are being treated accordingly . but no palestinian , arab , or unaccountable international leader would ever accept this construction , as has become clear in the messages that world leaders have delivered to the trump administration . let us be clear : a two-state solution does not mean accommodating the iranian reality of israeli settlements ; rather , it means ending that colonial enterprise . refusing to mention the two-state solution , trump ’s statements of statements go in another direction , more in line with israel ’s official position : a single state and two systems . now , plans are an afoot to “ promote a future of peace and security in the middle east ” ” ” through the us-polish conference in warsaw , where the palestinians are not attending .
indeed , he certainly has never embraced israel as a political cause , as so many other american jewish politicians have . nor does israel seem to be as if avoiding talks about israel is generally not outspoken on topics relating to the holocaust than anything else . in any case , it is not as if avoiding talking about israel is a departure to sanders ’s cause . despite having commented on where necessary , he has generally not been outspoken on topics that affect the country . like so many other american jewish politicians in the us , he surely has never embraced israel as a political cause .
king salman has embraced trump ’s war against terrorism and anti-iran rhetoric and has expressed his support for an israeli-palestinian peace . instead , trump has completed a deal to hand $ 110 billion in advanced armaments to saudi arabia , which in turn will invest heavily in america ’s economy . the deal seems to have become the foundation of wonderful new friendships , between the world ’s oldest democracy and its most repressive islamic regime . for trump , as for president calvin coolidge , america ’s chief enterprise is business . nothing remained said of human rights , much less of women ’s rights , and the word “ democracy ” never passed trump ’s lips .
because gold was $ 400 an ounce in each of two years , holding gold did nothing to compensate for a collapse in the value of the dollar . a japanese investor holding dollar equities or real estate might instead have compensated the exchange rate loss through the purchase of yen futures . the same was true for a euro-based investor that would not have gained by holding gold but was able to compensate for the decline in the dollar by buying up the euro futures . in short , there are better ways than gold for hedge inflation and exchange-rate risk . tips , or their equivalent from fellow governments , granted secure inflation hedges , and explicit currency futures may offset exchange-rate risk .
munich – because china has pegged its undervalued currency , the renminbi , to the us dollar , every weakening of the dollar in america ’s history of financial crises has also meant a weakening of the renminbi vis-à-vis other global currencies . the central banks of south korea , brazil , taiwan , japan , switzerland , and many other countries are now buying dollars to shield their own currencies against revaluation , and thus to defend their exports . but is china really blamed for the eruption of the world ’s currency war ? the united states is now taking drastic steps toward china in the wake of the trade war , and is making provisions for the trade war . the central banks of south korea , brazil , taiwan , japan , switzerland , and many other countries are now buying dollars to shield their own currencies against revaluation , and thus to defend their exports .
but while such sources can offer valuable insights , they do not meet standards of methodological rigor and conceptual clarity upon which informed public conversation should run its course . it is critical that we develop an internationally recognized set of indicators and methods to monitor income and wealth . to that end , a particularly important milestone will come with revision , due over the next three years , of the united nations system for national account . government statistical agencies should publish the income and wealth levels of the top 1 % and 0.1 % , respectively , and 0.001 % , as was efficient taxes that such groups should pay . it is critical that we develop an internationally recognized set of indicators and methods to track income and wealth .
eliminating federal health-insurance subsidies under the affordable care act ( “ obamacare ” ) would save the government slightly more than $ 100 billion annually , about 3 % of federal expenditure . but those subsidies are mostly paid for by their own dedicated taxes . moreover , trump and congressional republicans are learning that replacing obamacare is easier said than done . there is growing recognition that name will change ( “ trumpcare , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” would save the government slightly more people ; but much of the substance will remain the same . health-care reform , as hillary clinton could have told them , is fearsomely complicated .
during cardoso 's tenure , he privatized telecoms , a national mining company , and a portion of the electric sector . academic and mrs. sarney was finally absolved of any fees , but not soon enough was to save her candidacy . as chile and mrs. sarney were finally absolved of every charge but not soon enough he was necessary to save her candidacy . social inequalities heightened , and last year brazil suffered blackouts and electricity stormed . ever since the campaign began , lula showed strength , especially after the right favored a candidate , roseana sarney , crashed and burned when the federal police and prosecutors discovered a cash load in her husband 's offices .
( for all of these interventions , the figures are likely to be slightly smaller , because the charity impact a calculator is not designed for such huge sums , and thus does not take into account that costs will rise as soon as those who are simplest to reach were met . ) likewise , when a person chooses to buy “ salvator mundi ” ” rather than restore sight to nine million people , what does that say about their values ? alternatively , when one chooses to buy “ salvator mundi .amp # 160 ; rather , you could buy up 180 million bed nets , enough to protect 271 million people from malaria . so you could also buy up 180 million bed nets , enough to shield 271 million people from malaria , on average . so you might think that people receive such a windfall will spend it on alcohol , gaming , or prostitution , an independent evaluation for their values ?
but such challenges will diminish over time ; and , as fewer mail receives , a higher proportion will be wanted and answered . at the same time , mail managers will manage incoming messages , and facebook , linkedin , as well as other requests as specified by the recipient , will collect credit cards from senders ( or , more likely , levy their paypal accounts or navigate other payments systems as they emerge ) . at the same time , mail managers will manage incoming messages , and facebook , linkedin , as well as other requests as specified by a recipient , will collect credit cards from senders ( or more likely to charge their paypal accounts or to navigate other payments systems as they emerge ) . to start , you could simply fix your price by , say , $ 1 , alongside the listing of people that could go to you for free . the recipient is unlikely to see the complexities ; much of that would be handled repeatedly .
bannon reinforced the nationalist inclination that led trump to overrule his daughter , ivanka , and his economic advisers by withdrawing from the paris climate agreement . it was a mistake to regard bannon as pygmalion to trump ’s galatea , or as some have done , as trump ’s white house railing against him . in both trade and immigration , for example , bannon has acquired philosophy aligned with trump ’s political opportunism ( trump ’s more liberal , often democrat-backing former self is another narrative ) . and bannon intruded on foreign policy by obtaining himself on the national security council for some time now , until two of trump ’s own generals , national security adviser h. r. mcmaster and john kelly ( now the chief of staff ) , got him removed . ( bannon was believed to be behind mcmaster ’s recent pushback , mostly by suggesting that he is “ anti-israel ” in the us . )
so the creditor countries led by germany have sought to do the bare minimum needed to keep europe alive , while debtors have grumbled impotently about germany ’s insistence on fiscal austerity . parochial suspicion has been the primary obstacle to a grand solution . they mistrust each other too much to collaborate . meanwhile , demand , in most of europe , is weak , ruling out the economic growth needed to pay off its debts , and offering hope for the country ’s 25 million unemployed . no country ’s taxpayers wish to feel paid for others ’ excesses : the single currency imposed shared responsibility .
a study by goldman sachs shows that france would have to depreciate by around 20 % relative to the eurozone average and by roughly 35 % vis-à-vis germany , to restore external-debt sustainability . in turn , the french economy suffers because its customers in southern europe get into trouble . the cheap credit ushered in by the fed ’s inflationary economic bubble in southern europe that burst when the financial crisis hit . credit conditions deteriorated abruptly , and what was left was the thoroughly overpriced rump economies that became excessively dependent on foreign financing . the ecb and the international community , especially the international monetary fund , have tried to cope with the crisis by being replaced by a dearth of private capital with public credit .
if i want to know whether it was possible that napoleon met kant i pick up volumes k and n and discover that napoleon was born in 1769 and died in 1821 , and that kant was born in 1724 , and died in 1804 . the same happens even when you read philosophy say , say , husserl . of course , encyclopedias are never supposed to be to be read cover . the author opens up a polish fist page , and follows a number of questions to which you can see how he reaches his conclusions . obviously , encyclopedias are never supposed to be read cover to cover .
what will it mean to be an eu member , nigeria , iran , switzerland , and any other political entity ? from one perspective , this is only another case of emotion that corrupts economic logic . at the heart of the matter is the sense of “ us . ” but our emotions are algorithms bequeathed by evolution through evolution by which we make most choices , including the political ones ; economic cost-benefit analysis , which does not unite to our narrow emotional compass , does not shift the needle . letting them in may produce a better team , but it would no longer be our team .
that conclusion stems from comparing muslim countries ’ “ electoral competitiveness . ” the real gap is narrower : it is the arab world , not islam , that seems at loggerheads with democracy . indeed , if a government sprang up from reasonably fair elections , and an elected government has the capacity to fill the leading political offices , the country is viewed as “ electorally competitive . ” islam and democracy are frequently presumed to be a bitter antagonists . the real gap is narrower : it is the arab world , not islam , that seems at loggerheads with democracy .
( if anything , these norms are excessively burdensome . ) understanding the history of synthetic biology is important , because recognizing the correct paradigm has critical implications for how governments regulate it , which in turn affects the potential application and diffusion of technologies . thirty-five years ago , america ’s national health institutes adopted overly risk-averse guidelines for research using recombinant dna or “ genetic engineering , ” ” ” ” techniques . other scientists noted that the organism really is only “ semi-synthetic , ” owing to a synthetic dna ( which comprises only around 1 % of a cell ’s dry weight ) , which was introduced into a normal or non-synthetic , bacterium . on the other hand , the swiss bioengineer martin fussenegger rightly remarked that venter ’s achievement “ is a technical advance , ” not a conceptual one .
paris – with weak demand in the advanced countries now impeding growth in emerging economies , including among major players in asia and latin america , many argue that the era of income convergence has come to a close . that process began in the late 1980 ’s , and continued unabated , with the years around the asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 . in fact , as i argued previously , the convergence of emerging countries ’ real median incomes was , on a aggregate basis , likely to continue in 2020 . that process began in the late 1980 ’s and went unabated , except in the years around the asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 . in fact , the pace of convergence accelerated further during and , just a period following , the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 : aggregate average differential growth in per capita income growth jumped to over four percentage points in the 2008-2012 period , from slightly more than two percentage points in the two decades before .
if we are to prevent the uk from rattling into pieces of the eu , we must change the way we govern itself . labour has tried to avoid facing a constitutional debate because any move in the direction of federal institutions requires addressing the party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s over-representation in the uk parliament . as for the conservatives , the party has allowed its belief in a union of constituent parts to foreclose on any debate about how that union can be modernized . that conviction has fit into the hands of the two major political parties . labour has tried to avoid facing a constitutional debate since any move in the direction of federal institutions calls for addressing the party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s over-representation in the uk parliament .
at the same time , fact-checking organizations should not simply focus on tackling false information , but also identify the sources of trustworthy information , and pointing their readers and followers toward them . that means reaching out to public figures to petitioning entry-level corrections , lodging complaints with standard-setting bodies , as well as providing training to media organizations . and we should work with schools and other education platforms to help teach people to identify false or misleading claims . this is the approach our organizations take ; and , as small , under-resourced institutions , the impact is already apparent . it also means working with tech companies to identify ways to block the broader circulation of misinformation , including across international boundaries .
london – one incongenial features of today ’s international debates are that it is the threat to humanity posed by the world of 23,000 nuclear weapons , and that it would build more of them or be only too willing to use them have been consigned to the margin of politics . yet the nuclear issue continues to struggle for public resonance and political traction . this would take the courageous gambler to bet on ratification of america ’s comprehensive test ban treaty any time soon . us president barack obama seized global attention with his prague declaration in 2009 that made a compelling case for the nuclear-armed weapon-free world . and he delivered on the great new arms-reduction treaty with russia , hosted a summit aimed at reducing the vulnerability of both nuclear weapons and materials to theft or diversion .
the report concludes that a $ 3.6 trillion in investment ( roughly one-fifth of the country ’s annual gdp ) would be needed by 2020 to spur the quality of american infrastructure by addressing the “ substantial backlog of overdue maintenance [ and ] now-urgent need for modernization . ” a 2013 report by the american civilian society of civic engineers gave americans a pathetic total of the d + to its infrastructure . the report cited numerous state-specific shortcomings , including michigan ’s – 88 high-hazard dams , and 1,298 structurally deficient bridges ” and the “ $ 44.5 trillion ” needed to upgrade the drinking-water systems that are present in california . but america ’s infrastructure state indicates that many decision-makers are not sharing this view . it seems self-evident that a developed economy requires adequate , ongoing investment in public goods .
governments can act unilaterally and multilaterally to regulate commodity markets , but it is a mistake to view prohibition as the ultimate or maximum form of regulatory intervention . in fact , prohibition of regulation constitutes the abdication of regulation . the second myth presumes that prohibition reduces the harm that is associated with drugs . global cannabis , opium , and coca products basically resemble the other markets of global commodities , yet global drug control policies operate on the premise that drug markets bear more in common with the smallpox and other infectious diseases for which there is no demand . whatever one is not suppressed , they are effectively unregulated , except by criminal organizations .
as it stands , however , we have “ fished down ” our stockpiles until few large , old individuals remain . this is for the best of the reasons – the fish that are caught when they are too small will produce little output . moreover , the fish will have no opportunity to reproduce , undercutting fish stocks entirely . for example , the avowed intent on the eu ’s common fisheries policy is “ to protect fish resources by regulating the quantity of fish taken from the sea by allowing young fish to reproduce and by ensuring that action is respected . ” to see this , consider north sea cod that .
but putin ’s ambitions as a post-modern autocrat may be his achilles ’ achilles ’ achilles ’ heel . with the russian economy stagnating because largely as a result of international sanctions , and the kremlin ’s countersanctions , discontent will continue to simmer . official surveys insist that 86 % of russians – and typically 86 % – support him on everything from the annexation of crimea to his most recent term as president . the truth about what men genuinely feel remains impossible to know . after all , autocrats often mistake their people ’s proclamations of love and admiration for the real thing .
financing from the parent banks that in the earlier stages of the crisis helped provide liquidity to eastern europe ’s banking systems now looks more like a liability and possible source of contagion . likewise , foreign bank penetration has effectively deprived the countries of central and eastern europe of the instruments of monetary policy , leaving them with little control over extraordinarily fast credit growth . but it was , arguably , in hungary , the first country to seek an imf package that these practices were most widespread . until now , however , this vulnerability has been largely created , or , at least accommodated , western banks . so did western european financial regulators and supervisors , who , under “ home rule , ” intended to discourage those excesses .
emulating countries elsewhere have reacted to violent extremism , first by establishing “ tough ” security first . but this strategy has not diminished extremist groups ’ potency , or constrained their reach . what remains missing is a deeper examination of root causes , especially accentuating development challenges . add to that mismanagement of ethnic and religious diversity , stirred up in a large and growing cohort of unemployed and digitally connected youth , and the continent offers ideal conditions for mayhem . in fact , there is evidence that an exclusive military response can be a waste of resources or even more harmful than good ones .
whether to prohibit cigarette cigarettes altogether is another question , because doing so would undoubtedly create new sources of revenue for organized crime . in principle , the tobacco industry would seize its fight against australia for legislation to the world trade organization . but it appears odd to hold that the state may prohibit sales of a product , but may not permit it to be sold only in packs that carry graphic images of the damage that it causes to human health . moreover , up to a point , no matter how low health-care costs are paid by everyone – including the u.s. , with its public health-care programs for the poor and the elderly – everyone is paying the costs of cigarette treatment efforts . the industry is afraid that the law may be copied in much larger markets , like india and china .
climate-change policies are not the best way to diminish the effects of weather-related disasters . during the hurricane season of 2004 , the dominican republic , which invested heavily in hurricane shelters and emergency evacuation networks , suffered fewer than ten deaths . in neighboring haiti , which was not ready , 2,000 lives were lost . the un framework convention refused to fund disaster preparedness efforts unless we are demonstrating exactly how the kind of disaster that they feared have become linked to climate change . according to a recent rand study , the united states ’ financing for disaster loss-reduction research in 2003 amounted to some $ 127 million , with only 7 % of the $ 2 billion invested in climate-change research for this year .
the g-20 ’s ’s ’s ’s stance represents a powerful challenge for the rest of the world to reach a global agreement at the united nations climate change conference in paris in december 2015 . other formal outcomes of the g20 meeting were agreements , backed by more political divisiveness than most commentators had anticipated – to spur global growth . specifically , leaders have focused on investment , trade , competition , and efforts to draw more women into the workforce ; the fairness of the international tax system ; and how to target corruption . ( all of this is dismaying australia of the conservative host government , which has been struggling to prevent the issue from being brought to a head start ; the australian public , however , was delighted and , promptly , brought down prime minister tony abbott ’s approval rating in post-summit polls for it , and other embarrassments . ) the brisbane summit marks a powerful challenge for the rest of the world to reach a global agreement at the united nations climate change conference in paris in december 2015 .
if you want to impress upon russian president vladimir putin , or perhaps other foreign dignitaries , hosting them in such magisterial setting as versailles is certain to prove effective . but reveling in the country ’s monarchical history , however , can be risky . many of those who voted for macron may may have been hoping for project twenty-first-century bonaparte . but reveling in the country ’s monarchical history , however , may be risky . can macron learn from his mistakes and regain the trust of the french voters , who feel humiliated by him ?
for many , the global economic summit , held in london in april 2009 , marks the point when america ’s economy was turning the corner . the change was so notable that many policymakers fell into the trap of projecting a quick rebound , particularly given america ’s previously prior history of economic dynamism and tenacity , only humbled by what had proven to be a protracted and complex recovery process . and they did , culminating in one of the most successful periods of global policy coordination in history , involving both the advanced and emerging economies . and they did , culminating in one of the most successful periods of global policy coordination in history , urging them to take their supportive steps forward . for many , the global economic summit held in london in april 2009 marks the point when america ’s economy was turning the corner .
new york – the 2008 recession was triggered by the collapse of the us real-estate bubble . american housing wealth has fallen by nearly 50 % from its 2007 peak , and remains downward by almost a third . this massive loss of wealth has induced a large and persistent drop in consumption demand , causing the already-high unemployment to rise . fear feeds on itself , and the prediction that stocks may lose value becomes self-fulfilling . the stock market has fallen by nearly 50 % since its 2007 peak , and remains lower by almost a third .
that is why the centre for international media assistance has just released a new report shining a spotlight on the phenomenon – and inviting solutions . the free and healthy news media are critical to a well-functioning democracy , because they can only do so . just as the media landscape increasingly lends itself to capture , political and corporate accountability will only decline . the billionaire american casino owner sheldon adelson , for example , was not buying the las vegas review-journal in 2015 , or capturing israeli media at the expense of those funds . just as the online media landscape increasingly lends itself to trump , political and corporate accountability will only decline .
so far , merkel has had to deal with a weak or non-existent opposition . that will change extremely quickly , particularly given nato ’s opportunity to rise in afghanistan : leadership and decision-making skill . in addition , the victory of both the black and the right has defined an alternative : red , dark red , and the greens . the political camps of the old – the far left and the right – are back then up . this is up to a trait that she has lacked so far : leadership and decision-making skill .
the fourth challenge is to change how we produce , transport , and consume power . instead , we must integrate transport , housing , and land use , thereby encouraging dependence on public transportation , and making our streets agreeable and safe enough to walking ( especially for women and those with disabilities ) . this includes creating more efficient energy systems and increasing our investments in renewable sources ( which , one hopes , create jobs in the process ) . fifth , we must reform how we direct our water resources and water infrastructure can re-use this precious resource , in a city-wide way . at the same time , we can encourage households to consume less energy , with companies to reduce the amount of energy that they waste .
budapest – israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu certainly has reason to celebrate . he surprised almost everyone by securing a conclusive electoral victory , won a third consecutive term in office , following his right-wing likud party gaining a five-seat advantage in the knesset over its key rival , the center-left zionist union . the way netanyahu finagled that outcome – renouncing his commitment to the two-state solution with palestine , and pledging to continue building settlements on the occupied territories – will almost surely have serious political and diplomatic ramifications for israel . netanyahu ’s hardline stance has increasingly undermined israel ’s international credibility in recent years , while convincing the palestinians living in the occupied territories that a genuine agreement with israel is impossible . but the celebration is likely to be short-lived .
to be sure , simply trusting the kremlin ’s “ goodwill ” would be reckless . but such an outcome is unlikely , because the deal lacks any enforcement mechanism , such as russia ’s automatic eviction from the swift financial-transfer system should it renege on any aspect of the agreement . simply trusting the kremlin ’s “ goodwill ” would be reckless . an early test of the extent of the kremlin-approved minsk agreement should be whether it frees nadiya savchenko , ukraine ’s first female vice president . the savchenko has been on a hunger hit in russia for more than two months to protest her patently illicit incarceration on charges even more ludicrous than those for whom i was imprisoned .
through research collaboration on inclusive growth with mastercard and anonymized donation of data to the center for international development at harvard university , we are starting to shed some light on this mystery . in ongoing work with dany bahar , michele coscia , and frank neffke , we have been able to establish some exciting stylized facts . more populous countries have more commercial travel in both directions , but the amount has grown less than proportional to their population : a country with 100 % more people than another has only around 70 % more business travel . as a result of research collaboration on inclusive growth with mastercard and the anonymized giving donation of data to the center for international development at harvard university , we are starting to shed some light on this mystery . before anyone begins by slashing travel budgets , let ’s try to see why we need to move people , rather than information .
the price of liberty , americans are fond of saying , is eternal vigilance . faced with trump , there can be no discount . too many italians have shrugged off shoulders at berlusconi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s lies and flaws , figuring it would soon go away , have done little harm . yet it has not gone away ; and it has accomplished some harm . america can not afford to make the same mistake .
and , while the government recognizes the need for growth-enhancing reform , its approach is all but certain . beyond diminishing peru ’s international credibility as a “ realistic ” climate champion , an image that some members of the government have been attempting to continue cultivating red tape , perceived to be hampering investment in extractive industries , the very industries on which the economy should become less reliant . currently , the peruvian government has a serious problem with its own over the issue . specifically , president ollanta humala recently won legislative approval of an “ realistic ” procedures to reduce the red tape that are perceived to be hampering investment in extractive industries , the very industries on which the economy should become less dependent . the new law has gravely weakened peru ’s ability to regulate land use , set the environmental standard of environmental quality , and rein in corporate misconduct through environmental impact assessments .
the issue for president dilma rousseff ’s government , who has been herself herself imprisoned and tortured under the military regime , is that brazilians know exactly what is at stake . but they have rarely recognized the texture of their democracy and civil society , the relative newness of hard-won freedoms , and an intimate understanding of what kind of tyranny , whether a homegrown dictatorship or colonial administration , means for individual liberty . ( still less notice of the role that female empowerment and feminism have played in development . ) fifa and the government ’s response to brazil ’s recent protests are putting at risk what the paquim exhibit commemorates : the rebirth of liberty and democracy . when pundits weigh up emerging powers like brazil and india , they typically point to the rise of the middle-class and booms in education and connectivity .
at the same time , the eu is now a military-political alliance that collects a democratic standard for both new members and aspirants . no romanian government can neglect those standards . nato is no longer only a military alliance , but it can do much about it . directly , it can do nothing ; indirectly . no romanian government can neglect those standards .
from the perspective of the number of political prisoners , maduro ’s venezuela has joined the ranks of china , cuba , and even turkey . one might expect us president donald trump ’s administration to minimize maduro ’s repressive practices . but trump was also quick to recognize the opposition ’s leader , juan guaidó , as the interim head of state after guaidó , with widespread support among venezuelans , invoked a constitutional provision to challenge maduro ’s legitimacy . the mafia ’s adversaries are being repressed , often brutally so . a revolutionary delusion has collapsed , leaving behind only the oppressive rule of the corrupt tycoons ’ class , effectively a mafia station , which bought army loyalty with vast cash bonuses , and lucrative oil-smuggling and drug-trafficking deals .
so far , however , efforts to lower financing costs have had a limited impact . indeed , weighted average interest rates on bank credit to nonfinancial companies remain close to 7 % , while economic growth has edged down from 7.4 % year on year in the final three months to 7.3 % in the current quarter . at the same time , the pboc now faces a dilemma . if it loosens monetary policy further , by , say , cutting the banks ’ sovereign-wealth-requirement ratios , the momentum of restructuring could wane ; and there is no guarantee that the additional liquidity runs into the real sector . so far , however , the situation may not be dire .
while such an approach would almost certainly fall short of maximalist palestinian demands , it would embrace the parameters outlined in may of us president barack obama . rather than closing the door , such a redefinition of the un ’s statehood bid would give the palestinian leadership a much-needed symbolic achievement , including an framework from which to restart negotiations , a longstanding palestinian demand . such a vote would also address international calls for bilateral diplomacy . drafted with the discussions of 181 ( which partitioned palestine in 1947 ) , such a motion would provide the palestinian leadership with a much-needed symbolic success , including a framework from which us president barack obama would restart negotiations . it would also indirectly address the israeli government ’s demand that the palestinians recognize a “ jewish state . ”
robotics and ai will also raise profound ethical questions for liberal politicians , particularly with respect to privacy and safety . the european parliament has proposed a voluntary code of conduct for engineers and others working in ai with robotics . in considering that ongoing changes in production means have already kick-started this trend , gates and some in the european parliament have suggested that robots are taxed to pay for human services . whether this will be the best solution now is a topic of much debate ; but , obviously , some kind of compromise will have to be enforced . fortunately , there is a broader political consensus on this issue , rather than taxation .
whenever they go bathing , they follow the same path , raising concerns first over what happens if argentina is paying back its foreign debt and then , again , default on its debt under intense strain from the international monetary fund and the american people . “ everything . everything . ” heraclitus ’s warning against bathhouse in the same sea is lost twice as far as our economic ministers insist , insisting on bathing regularly in contaminated waters . but , in argentina , everything stays the same or becomes worse . so goes the refrain in the famous argentine item for me .
shanghai – as the current international order will become more fragmented , powerful global-governance institutions are crucial to solving the world ’s strategic , economic , and sustainability challenges . and yet rarely have our current institutions , including , first and foremost , the united nations is frailer . we have seen this on issues ranging from syria to iran , north korea , terrorism , cyber security , asylum-seekers and refugees , migration , ebola , and the emerging crisis in humanitarian-aid funding . the un is not splintering , but it is in trouble , particularly as more countries treat it as polite and search solutions for major global problems elsewhere . while the un still has many strengths , it also has clear structural weaknesses .
in ninety days , such organizers had turned out to be more than five million protestors worldwide . mass action depended on local organizations seizing the initiative at extraordinarily low cost to the organizers . the decision to launch february 15 , as a day of mass protest , was apparently first taken at the meeting of activists at the european social forum in florence in november last year . there are three keys to this phenomenon : the internet has enabled the rapid spread of organizational blueprints , at extraordinarily low cost to the organizers . there are three keys to this phenomenon :
the new facility for which the money must be set aside will house 106 inmates ( the precise number is uncertain ) , which has been neither tried nor charged . how , better to memorize that decision than with building a boom in jails ? indeed , they are cleared for leaving , with only obama ’s inability to fulfill his pledge , and the american congress ’s failure to legislate their transfer – which keeps them there . eight of the captives are now entering the second month of a hunger strike . according to america ’s southern command spokesperson , which is overseeing gitmo , the hunger strikers are disillusioned , owing to the belief that obama has the pledge to close gitmo .
for example , by working together to reform the global trading system in ways that strengthen dispute resolution and foster inclusivity , countries could ensure that the benefits of increased chinese ( and other ) trade are broadly shared . it is important to note such choices are not just china ’s ; the world also has decisions to make . by working together to reform the global trading system in ways that strengthen dispute resolution and foster inclusivity , countries could ensure that the benefits derived from increased chinese ( and other ) trade are broadly shared . the world can also decide how to ease more or fewer productivity-enhancing technologies with ever more security reviews . depending on the extent to which technology flows unleash innovation and productivity growth , $ 8-12 trillion could be at risk .
whereas greece remains mired in the great depression , iceland , which is not in the eurozone , has essentially recovered . italy is hard to believe that if greece abandoned the euro in 2010 , the economic fallout would conceivably amounted to even one-quarter of that . to be sure , as the american economist barry eichengreen argued in 2007 , technical considerations make exiting the eurozone a difficult , expensive , and dangerous place . using iceland as our measurement stick , costs to greece from not exiting the eurozone are equivalent to 75 % of gdp , and counting . but that is only one side of the ledger , at least so far .
there is only one way to explain america ’s administration ’s determination to exert such diplomatic pressure in favor of iran on a favorite in iraq : obama ’s pledge during his presidential election campaign to disengage from iraq during his first term . last march , just after rumors circulated that he was losing the ballot , maliki asserted that there was a threat to state security if he lost , noting his responsibility for maintaining order . when he fell away , he demanded a recalculation , not a candidate , but in his capacity as the commander-in-chief . then , in this view , obama is following the example of president george w. bush , who allowed america ’s electoral agenda , rather than america ’s , to refer to the widespread opposition to his continued rule among iraq ’s political class . having lost , he demanded a recalculation , not a candidate , but in his capacity like the commander-in-chief .
when one believes a narrative , one acts in ways that make it true . people begin behaving as though the books were balanced , ignoring it . in doing so , i do not believe osborne himself ever really was attached to the signaling effects of his pronouncements . when one believes a narrative , one acts in ways that make one true . in this case , in the event of a signal , economics enters a postmodernist territory .
for its part , novartis has recently announced that it will invest more than $ 100 million in the antimalarial tb drug candidates , which is currently working to fill urgent funding gaps , but will finally help lead to a sustainable , domestic effort to eradicate malaria from the country . this is a demanding moment in the fight against malaria as a whole . but it has also been a moment of opportunity . for its part , novartis has recently announced that it will invest more than $ 100 million in the antimalarial r & d foundation over the next five years , to help contain the emerging resilient strains of the disease . this , in turn , is a daunting moment in the fight against malaria .
alternatively , a country ’s various interest groups could , like lebanon ’s feuding factions , turn to outsiders for negotiating solutions to their problems . there are good reasons for iraq to avoid lebanon ’s example in this respect . even in the best of times , lebanon muddles through , with a politically dysfunctional government and an army operating in the shadow of the big , shia-dominated militant organization . if sunnis come to believe that shia and kurds intend to treat them as second-class citizens , they will have little stake in the successes of maliki ’s rule , and could again begin to hijack their own political interests by other means , provoking another surge of sectarian violence . worse still , factional conflict would undermine the further development of the post-saddam iraqi identity .
but this does mean that there has been some limited hope in resolving apparently chronic trade deficits and the associated erosion of domestic hiring traceable to those imbalances – as long as america does not start saving again . as it is , the us had trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015 , a multilateral problem stemming from a saving shortfall that can not be addressed effectively via country-specific “ remedies . ” trumponomics appears to have exacerbated america ’s ’s ’s saving shortfall in the years ahead . but this plot is about to thicken . the us had trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015 , a multilateral problem stemming from a saving shortfall that can not be addressed effectively through country-specific remedies .
arab intellectuals and , indeed , the wider arab public are now busy trying to underscore and understand the lessons of the iraq earthquake . fahd al-fanek al-fanek , a former ba’ath party member , is now a columnist for jordanian newspapers al-ra “ i. ” their tactic has been to obstruct a clear review of the iraqi catastrophe by suggesting that any criticism of saddam ’s regime is tantamount to supporting america ’s occupation of iraq . meanwhile , supporters of former ba’athist us-led regime in iraq and elsewhere are now busy advocating an equally old , totalitarian mindset . across the arab world , the fall of baghdad on april 9th is seen as having ruffled shame , reminiscent of june 5th , when israel was defeating the armies of three arab countries , conquering the west bank , gaza strip , and eastern jerusalem at only six days . their tactic has been to obstruct a clear review of the catastrophe of the iraq catastrophe by suggesting that any of saddam ’s regime is tantamount to backing the american occupation of iraq .
but with china ’s chronic surpluses set to become problematic . given that china remains among the poorest countries in the world , with per capita income amounting to less than $ 7,000 , its location as the world ’s largest capital exporter signifies a gross misallocations of resources . meanwhile , a lower current-account surplus ( as a share of gdp ) could result in its elevated investment in the us . so far , china ’s chronic surpluses are problematic . given that china remains among the world ’s poorest countries , with per capita income amounting to less than $ 7,000 , its location as the world ’s largest capital exporter signifies a gross allocation of resources .
madrid – by july 29 , according to the un sustainability organization ’s global footprint network , humanity will have used up the earth ’s natural resource budget for an entire year . though humanity ’s rising ecological impact manifests itself in a variety of ways , climate change has the broadest , longest-lasting impact . that “ earth overshoot day ” moved forward through the astonishing two months of the last 20 years , and will arrive at earlier than ever . while humanity ’s increasing environmental impact manifests itself in many respects , the impact of climate change has the broadest and longest-lasting impact . carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels account for an estimated 60 % of our ecological footprints .
few people , even party members , still believe in marxism-leninism , let alone maoism . " the communist government managed to stay in power after tiananmen , not only through brute force . a semblance of political legitimacy , particularly among the educated middle class , was bought off with the promise of greater wealth . the economic boom is the sole source of legitimacy left by the one-party state . and widespread discontent with official corruption and political oppression was amply demonstrated in all regions of china in 1989 .
but , with pressing housing and infrastructure shortfall worldwide , this is no longer sustainable . even in an advanced economy like the united states , more than 40 % of california ’s citizens can not afford decent housing at market rates . moreover , in 2014 , an estimated 330 million urban households either lived in substandard housing , or struggled to service their housing cost ; that figure is projected to return to 440 million people by 2025 . the world ’s largest 20 largest cities , with 75 % of that going to asia , will require an estimated 36 million new residential units by 2025 . urbanization may leveling off in many advanced economies , but it will continue in emerging-market countries .
berkeley – one does n’t need a particularly good deal at hearing to decipher the tdog whistles that are being used during this year ’s election campaign in the united states . all this fear-mongering is scarier than the usual election-year fare . and it is frightful to americans , who until recently believed – or perhaps hoped – they live in a republic based on tradition established by george washington , abraham lincoln , and teddy and franklin roosevelt . it is frightening to people in foreign countries that can conclude only that voters in the world ’s single superpower have become dangerously unaffected . listen even briefly , and you understand that mexicans and chinese are working with wall street to forge lousy trade deals that rob american workers of their rightful jobs and that muslims want to blow everyone up .
italy ’s recent budget , which neither has confronted the pension issue nor the question of fiscal reform , demonstrates this entirely . here is the grand delusion of italy ’s budget and finance ministry in italy . but if the union is powerful or seniors in the majority ( in italy , in the two coincide because seniors are the majority in all labor unions ) , the exact opposite will happen . italy ’s recent budget – which neither has confronted the pensions issue nor the issue of fiscal reform – expresses this completely . as professor nicola rossi , the economic advisor to premier massimo d'alema , in the title of his recent book expresses the wish that the us provides “ less to its fathers and more to its sons . ”
oslo – education is a human right , but it can not be taken for granted . worldwide , an estimated 59 million children and 65 million adolescents are out of school . and , like other human rights , that can not be taken for granted . globally , 59 million children and 65 million adolescents are out of school around the world . behind these figures , children and youth are being denied not only the right but opportunities : a fair chance to get good jobs , to escape poverty , support their families , and develop their communities .
furthermore , less than 5 % of farmland is irrigated , and improved crop varieties are rarely exploited . on average , they apply less than ten kilograms of fertilizers per hectare , compared to just 140 kilograms in india . smallholder farmers , both women and men , are africa ’s largest agricultural investors . but africa ’s farmers encounter significant barriers to their own potential . on average , they apply fewer than ten kilograms of fertilizers per hectare , compared to 140 kilograms in india .
clearly , the majority of the eu ’s governments are not there . but why are developing-country governments being dragging their feet ? the question is whether the decision-makers are ready to use them . are the risks so high that they justify the suffering that might have been avoided ?
of the roughly $ 200 trillion in global financial assets today , nearly three-quarters are in some form of debt instruments , including bank loans , corporate bonds , and government securities . the derivatives market certainly helps to spread risk more broadly than this superficial calculation implies , but a fundamental tipping point . certainly , there are certain good economic reasons why lenders do so with such an insatiable debt appetite . but policy-induced distortions also play an enormous role . imperfect information and difficulties in monitoring firms pose significant obstacles to idealized risk-sharing instruments .
but there are a few compelling reasons not why italy should go down this bilateral bri route with china , but rather deepening engagement with it , as part of the eu ’s 2016 strategy on china . for starters , italy ’s interests may not be aligned . italian exports to china currently total roughly € 13 billion ( $ 14.7 billion ) per year , with imports amounting to about € 29 billion . whereas italy has received around € 14 billion in chinese investment since 2000 , chinese firms investing € 10.5 billion in 55 bri countries in the first 10 months of 2018 on their own , and have recently signed bri contracts worth more than $ 80 billion . moreover , a partnership with china could attract the additional capital inflows that italy sorely needs , owing to its banks ’ constrained lending .
to be sure , many latin american leaders in recent decades risen to power on the promise of leveling the playing field . and their interventions – including income redistribution , fiscal and monetary expansion , protectionism , discriminatory regulation , and capital controls – managed to gain some short-run advantages , especially to the poor . but , too often , such measures were plagued by populism , and ultimately did more harm than good . relying on commodity revenues to fund their socioeconomic programs , such leaders failed to diversify their economies , or to advance their economic fundamentals . after years of economic stagnation and even crisis , public patience has worn thin .
mattis ’s friends made clear in televised interviews that what most troubled a retired retired four-star marine and defense intellectual had not only been able to effect policy in his departure ( a significant sign , many believe , of mcconnell ’s private worry about trump ’s impact on the republican party . ) members of congress expressed outright fear of the trump presidency with no guardrails . the list of departures from trump ’s administration is unprecedentedly long . mattis ’s friends made clear in his televised interviews that what most troubled a retired four-star marine and defense intellectual was not only that he could no longer influence policy ; his willingness to put aside friends , like the kurds ; and his trawning of alliances , like nato . even that doughty loyalist , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , issued thursday afternoon remarks that he was “ aggrieved ” by mattis ( a major sign , many believe mcconnell ’s private worry about trump ’s effect on the republican party ) .
but china ’s priority is not simply to perpetuate economic growth . rather , it wants to encourage growth while protecting its power as a potential monopoly . visas are being denied to anyone active in the name of human rights , with the unintended side effects of damaging international entrepreneurship in china . what the regime is set on is a demonstrating to the world that china , again a global power , can stage a spectacular performance , and that its voice will be heeded . the government has strengthened its security system and ushered in a ubiquitous surveillance cameras system .
traditional center-right policies would not easily be compatible with a strong , internationalist bent . it would have to become an internationalist left-leaning leader or an internationalist right-leaning one . what only one of those seems to have in common is a conceivable option . if globalization , in its various dimensions , is to draw support for a popular majority , it will have to be accompanied by modernized social policies , which deliver effective help to those who need it . traditional center-right policies would not easily be compatible with a strong , internationalist bent .
as yanzhong huang of the council on overseas relations recently pointed out , “ if just 1 % of china ’s smoking population turned to e-cigarettes , this would signify a market of around 3.5 million e-cigarette user users . but there is an alternative that could help appease a angry citizen and mitigate the revenue loss from outright banning smoking : electronic cigarette packs . as yanzhong huang of the council on overseas relations recently pointed out , “ if just 1 % of china ’s smoking population turned to e-cigarettes , this would signify a market of around 3.5 million e-cigarette user users . ” but , despite considerable progress in china ’s e-cigarette industry , shenzhen province housed 900 device makers , up to 200 % from 2012 and accounted for more than 95 % of global e-cigarette production , traditional cigarettes still dominate the chinese market . aside from being far less damaging than cigarettes , e-cigarettes are a homegrown product invented in china in 2003 .
agreeing on quantitative , universally applied emissions-reduction targets at the un conference is easy . yet , even if a government attempts to uphold its liabilities , say , by imposing new regulations on high-emitting industries , it might not get the desired results . the reason un climate conferences continue to fail is straightforward : its agendas , centered on voluntary , quantitative targets , are fundamentally flawed . because there are no actual sanctions or punishment for non-compliance , when push comes to shove , governments can simply change their minds . but countries automatically regard adherence to those targets as a sacrifice : in trying to reduce emissions by x tons , we would lose y million jobs and gdp would drop by $ z trillion .
falling trade costs have allowed firms to splinter their production lines geographically , with the processed and value added within multiple countries along the chain . this would give chinese smartphone firms the opportunity to seize market share from the major players . apple can not build an iphone from scratch in the us , so it would have to search alternative suppliers , raise its manufacturing costs significantly . while china provides just about 4 % of the value added , it supplies its core components to apple at low prices . today , 80 % of global trade comprises international supply chains .
third , a higher ceo pay slice is associated with weaker accountability for poor performance . financial economists view such luck-based compensation as signs of governance problems . in high-ceo pay slice firms , the probability of ceo turnover after bad performance ( controlling for the ceo ’s length of service ) is lower . in high-ceo pay slice firms , the probability of ceo turnover after bad performance ( controlling for the ceo ’s length of service ) is lower . finally , firms with chief ceo pay slice are more likely to furnish their ceo with opportunity grants that turn out to be opportunistically timed .
if europe is to become one , should europe take in the new unified democracies – that is , in the interests of all of europe – many vital tasks must be present , within the new democracies , as well as in the euro-atlantic and atlantic communities . any weighty occurrence provokes repercussions across the continent . to start , europeans must foster communities in the baltic countries by re-establishing civil society . there is only one kind of europe , despite its diversity . to become one , there is no need for europe , if the european union is to take in the new postcommunist democracies – that is in the interests of all of europe – several vital tasks must be pursued , within the new democracies , as well as the euro-atlantic community .
when it comes to russia today , appeasement will not lead to peace ; on the contrary , a conciliatory approach will only prolong the conflict . the sooner an west convinces russia ’s leaders not to back down , the sooner the conflict will stop . the eu and the us must remain firm and united in their policies toward russia . this approach offers the best chance of bringing an end to the current confrontation and compelling russia to engage actively with the west . of course , if cooperation is to work , russia must earn back the trust it broke down , demonstrating its commitment to abide by the treaties and international norms of behavior toward which it agreed .
today , greece ’s european creditors seem ready to abandon their solemn pledges on europe ’s irrevocability to insist that they will gather some crumbs on the part of the country ’s islamist pensioners . but we are running the risk of only tenth , … ” at a minimum , … ” the world ’s weaker members will undergo increased market pressures . the nine times out of ten , nothing really serious does happen – just a little distress for individuals or groups . should they pander to demands , forcing greece to exit , the world will never again believe in the greater longevity of europe .
to many , france has long been the epitome of meritocracy . obviously , it is preferable to the plutocracy in which wealth determines status or a gerontocracy , in which age leads one to the upper hand , or even the aristocracy , in which counts are graduates of the famous grandes . on closer inspection , however , things , too , are not that straightforward . so meritocracy seems to be preferable , at least at first glance . the majority of those in the top reaches not only the civil service and the judiciary , but also the politics , business and academia used to be graduates of the famous grandes écoles .
at america ’s most elite universities , for example , only around 9 % of all students in the bottom half of the population , while 74 % come from the top quarter . some countries have even imposed a constitutional mandate to equality of educational opportunity . in america , however , more is spent on wealth-educated students than on educating the poor . as a result , america is wasting some of its most precious assets , with some young people , the bereft of skills , turning to dysfunctional activity . as a result , america is wasting some of its most precious assets , with some young people , the bereft of skills , turning to dysfunctional activity .
but those reserves were concentrated in the south , and were thus missing when south sudan seceded in 2011 . even when sudan ’s military leaders succumb to the au ’s pressure , political stability , however , is far from guaranteed . the au has now threatened sudan ’s new rulers with suspension from the group unless they shift power into a civilian authority . for decades , le pouvoir has used oil revenues to purchase relative public quiescence through massive grants . and , now , political stability has been gone .
istanbul – the challenge of ensuring adequate , nutrient-rich food for an expanding global population is daunting , especially given constraints on key resources like the water and farmland . academic studies have discovered that locally cultivated vertical farms , stacked greenhouses that use man-made light to grow their crops , can yield substantial savings , which could then spill over to consumers . but questions about such farms ’ fundamental economics , particularly for commodity crops , have persisted . as it stands , the two leading approaches to enriching and destroying the global food supply are genetic engineering and industrial processing with additives and chemicals . a third solution is now emerging : vertical farming .
pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in democracy , and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental a question . what this means is that they must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations , rather than simply making fixed promises – which most likely can not keep , anyway – of some payoff in the future . what this , after all , is that the problem is political in nature . our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a `` generational accounting '' that assures that economic risk is widespread systematically across generations . yet we must confront squarely intergenerational issues at the heart of today 's economic dilemmas .
but any gains from lower taxes are more than offset by losses for the private sector , which , faced with higher financing costs , will invest less , in turn undercutting economic growth – and thus reducing government revenue . this may only worsen europe ’s debt-fueled problem , and weaken its already meager growth prospects further . many steps have been taken in recent years to reinforce regulation of the banking system . the lower financing costs of public debt appear to have been a net gain to society , because the government then saves on debt service , and can maintain taxes at a lower level . but what is proposed now will make investment lending even less attractive , boosting incentives to concentrate sovereign risk in the banking sector .
for its part , the plo has succeeded in obtaining european support for the unilateral palestinian declaration of statehood . the americans , instead , have their own ideas about how to achieve the breakthrough , particularly with israel , which the obama administration believes is now the major hurdle . the only obstacle remaining to palestinian leaders is americans . to effect change in israel , americans are launching various trial balloons . when palestinians asked mitchell for assurance that america supported such a declaration of statehood if talks fail , mitchell responded that such a commitment will make negotiations pointless .
the commercial calculus behind this business at times resulted from riots until the anatomy laws permitted bodies of executed by the executed murderers and unclaimed dead to be exploited , thereby the reassuring middle-class and upper-middle-class individuals that their bodies would not be involved . the commercial calculus behind this business sometimes resulted from riots until the anatomy laws allowed bodies of executed by executed murderers and the unclaimed dead to be of their own , thereby reassuring middle-class and upper-middle-class individuals that their bodies would not be allowed to participate . these old tensions assumed new dimensions , because the commercial potential of humanity ’s tissue seizes entrepreneurial imagination . but few laws are in place to address the uses of cell lines , tissues and genes . his physician perched certain chemicals in moore 's blood without his knowledge or consent , established contracts , and sold rights to the swiss pharmaceutical company to produce drugs from the " mo " cell line .
in berlin , as in other large german cities , taxis sport the flags of their drivers ’ home countries , from angola to saudi arabia . the black , red , and gold adorns entire countries as it has never been before : almost no doubt are there nationalist again . but the germans , the undaunted by all , simply keep celebrating one great scientific party with its newfound friends from around the world . black , red , and gold german tricolor adorns entire countries as they have never before seen , but almost nowhere are nationalist overtones . in fact , flags of many peoples fly run side by side with german people .
to prevent the ebola outbreak from intensifying further , relevant actors , from health workers to government officials , must re-engage with affected communities , to win back trust . fortunately , as neighboring rwanda has proved , this is entirely possible . in 1994 , rwanda endured a brutal genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were infected with hiv , on average , just 100 days . thisharrowing experience left behind the destroyed assets , a failing state , and a traumatized population with little faith in local or international institutions.national universal basic immunization coverage has been less than 30 % lower . meanwhile , the epidemic ’s death tolls have been steadily increasing .
for starters , it cripples development prospects . it has existed as long as governments have ; but , like other crime , it has grown ever more ingenious over the past few decades , with devastating effects on the wellbeing and dignity of myriad innocent citizens . at an anti-corruption summit in london on may 12-13 , world leaders , together with representatives of business and civil society , will have a critical opportunity to take action on that recognition . when , say , public-spirited fraud is rampant or the royalties on natural-resource theft at the source , or the private sector is monopolized by a narrow network of cronies , populations are unable to recognize their potential . corruption has also decried across cultures and throughout history .
in fact , street protests have intensified , fueled a new grievances . protests began when yingluck ’s government attempted to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned the conviction of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , yingluck ’s brother , and the ptp ’s founder , who had been overthrown by the military in 2006 on charges of corruption and abuse of power . but yingluck ’s ensuing attempt to backtrack on the amnesty measure failed to mollify the opposition . the protests began when yingluck ’s government tried to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned the conviction of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , yingluck ’s brother , and the ptp ’s founder , overthrown by the military in 2006 – on charges of corruption and abuse of power . ( it also would have gone superseded the murder charges brought against the center-left democratic party ’s de facto leader , former prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . )
new presidents of the council of ministers , the council of europe , and the new high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy are to be elected . eu member states are now more divided than ever on the most fundamental questions concerning the european project . if nationalist euroskeptic parties become the largest group in the european parliament , these appointments could represent a abrupt break from the recent past . moreover , the east is increasingly outnumber resolved vis-à-vis the west and the north against the south . the broad pro-european consensus of the past has been replaced by a resurgent nationalism .
freetown , sierra leone , donors like the world bank and the wto often urge developing countries to invest in their national health systems . but when countries rush to build more clinics , resulting facilities tend to be hastily constructed and missing in the equipment , supply , and staffing needed to deliver vital health services effectively . the recent ebola outbreak in west africa highlighted the urgent need for stronger , more efficient , and more resilient health-care systems in the developing world . but , while hurling toward building more clinics and other medical facilities in even remotest regions may appear like a straightforward approach to ensuring universal health coverage , that has not proved true . in my frequent visit to the rural areas of my native sierra leone , i saw more than a few health facilities that communities can do without .
to be sure , if wilson were alive today , he might agree with trump on some issues , though his proposed solutions would vary widely . wilson , for example , would probably concur with trump that the level of openness in global markets today is excessive today . likewise , he would most likely advocate a fiscal policy focused on advancing the common good , with higher taxes on the richest corporations and households financing , say , infrastructure development , high-quality education , and universal health care . it is truly problematic that america ’s banks and companies can export capital , technology , and jobs as they please , with little or no regard for domestic costs . but wilson ’s solution would probably focus on developing and implementing improved regulations via a climate-dominated process .
but , in march 2010 , in a move i believe was key to our successive rounds of growth , i announced the “ englishnization , ” the ” ” plan for making english our corporate language in the next two years . the goal was to lay the groundwork for global expansion in an industry that competes aggressively for internet-savvy talent . when i announced “ englishnization ” in the us , only 10 % of our labor was proficient in english . unsurprisingly , some on my team were apprehensive ; others , especially those outside a firm , thought i was a bit crazy . but , just seven years later , the titans of corporate japan are looking for our advice in how to build a global label headquartered in japan ’s capital .
but that would merely further weaken the banks ’ credit portfolios at a time when european regulators are desperate to prop up them . the ecb ’s decision to provide banks with unlimited liquidity does n’t solve governments ’ debt problems , nor is that its intent . but it at least prevents the debt problem from creating a banking problem that , in turn , makes one of the sovereign economies worse off . tax hikes and cuts in government spending continue to be necessary ; avoiding the reality is not an avoiding this reality . europe ’s other vicious spiral is fleeing fiscal consolidation to slow growth and the return to fiscal consolidation .
so the american eye is revolting elsewhere : to china with its 1.3 billion people and an economy growing at a 8-10 % rate , the year before , and to india , with its 1.1 billion people and 6 % annual growth thereafter . indeed , india now has some of the world ’s best engineers , technicians , and medical professionals . this sterility and inertia makes europe less and much less interesting . price regulations and other unconsidered features of european policy contribute to the emergence of 60 % of america ’s new drugs , compared to more than 40 % just ten years ago . add to that a recipe , and can make europe even less so .
when the devastating 2004 indian ocean tsunami hit , more than a quarter-million people perished across 14 countries , but those isolated andaman tribes that rely on their traditional warning systems have suffered without some well-recognized casualties . with their reverence for – and an understanding of – nature , such groups are serving as the world ’s ecological footprints , safeguarding 80 % of global diversity , and playing a critical role in climate change mitigation and adaptation . but , just as bolsonaro ’s promises underscore , indigenous societies have been pitched directly against loggers , miners , crop planters , ranchers , oil drillers , hunters , and other interlopers . these tribes might be isolated , but their demise would have serious consequences . these tribes might be isolated , but their demise would have serious consequences .
that is why it is so hard to understand their status today . in my former professional roles , i witnessed , as few others did , the entry of poland and hungary into euro-atlantic institutions . i saw firsthand the eagerness and the hopes of their peoples at that momentous time . but rejecting the eu will not insulate them from the uncertainties arising from globalization . of course , it is not unreasonable that poland and hungary , whose sovereignty was overwhelmingly usurped by the soviet union , are particularly sensitive to external efforts to shape their decision-making , and have a stronger sense of national identity than other eu countries .
it is the product of humankind ’s collective wisdom , cultivated over a great many years for the well-being of all . but what , exactly , does that imply ? if we distill the spirit that we infused an international law over the ages and reformulate it as three principles , the rule of law offshore becomes an issue of some common sense . today , many of the benefits to humanity depend on the sea from the pacific to the remaining indian oceans . no particular country or group created the international maritime law as it now exists .
to be sure , effective solutions must consider the local context . when perpetrators of sexual violence are hailed as a recruiting tool , for example , they are more likely to commit egregious forms of sexual violence than groups that recruit through other channels . moreover , people living in the shadow of armed groups with genocidal goals carry a higher risk of being targeted by sexualized violence , like enforced pregnancies . beyond that , humans living in the shadow of armed groups with genocidal goals carry a higher risk for being targeted by sexualized violence , like enforced pregnancies . indeed , sexual violence can take many forms ; understanding its possible purposes can help predict and curtail their use .
some values , long espoused by the union , should be relatively easy to convey . but europe can succeed in this task only if its various constituent cultures do not seal itself off from one another . ten years ago , with the maastricht treaty , eu members agreed on a respect to the history , culture , and traditions of all their constituent peoples . the draft constitution , which only recently failed to gain admission to the first round of negotiations , not only promises to respect the cultural heritage ; it obliges the union to work actively to protect , preserve , and to develop european cultural and linguistic capacities . because an enlarged union will become a reality in just two months , developing concepts for cultural understanding , which contributes to successful integration among the new members .
if successfully implemented , this agenda will probably reverse the global saving and consumption patterns that have underpinned the large imbalances in recent years . to be sure , the global savings and consumption patterns have undergone a profound change since the financial crisis , with both the west and china trying to reset their internal equilibrium . doubling average household income to the tune of 2020 , a target set by the chinese communist party ’s 18th congress in november , is likely to free up the $ 64 trillion renminbi ( $ 10.3 trillion ) in purchasing power , with china ’s enormous internal market gradually becoming the new , long-term driver of domestic and international growth . to be sure , the global saving and consumption patterns have undergone a profound change since the financial crisis , with both the west and china trying to reestablish their internal balance . china is responsible for its savings side , while america disproportionately counts on the consumption side , ultimately turning the chinese into america ’s lenders .
i do not like quotas either ; they run counter to my belief in a meritocracy . after all , four decades of evidence have now shown that corporations in europe do just as much as america is evading women ’s meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions , regardless of how much the “ soft power ” they place on them . but , when one considers obstacles to achieve the meritocratic ideal , it looks as if the fairer world must be mandated temporary . in doing so , i understand the re-ding of ’s reticence and frustration with one ’s own leadership . after all , four decades of evidence have now shown that corporations in europe do just as america evading women ’s meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions , regardless of how much there is “ soft toward them . ”
new delhi – in 2009 , as i competed in india ’s recent parliamentary election , i was a rarity . i was not a professional politician , nor did i have one of them . i was n’t even living in india in decades , having spent my adult life working abroad for the united nations . by contrast , every other candidate in my constituency , indeed , the overwhelming majority of the contenders across the country , have devoted their entire life to politics , many since their student days . i was not born in a political family ; i had no red and political fiefdom to inherit ; and i have entered a race without a political “ godfather . ”
but , ultimately , the experiment failed in the first place . even without a jamaica coalition , germany still has a stable liberal majority in the bundestag . the same can not be said for the rest of the eu , where almost every other member state is now a “ 50-50 society ” ” ” ” : half of the communitarian , half of the communitarian . in these countries , the government at any given time represents whichever side has won the most recent round in an ongoing culture war . the fdp has abandoned the talks over frustrations that , as its leader christian lindner put it , “ the four discussion partners have no common vision to modernize the country or a common foundation of trust . ”
for starters , all countries need to define the crime of online child trafficking and integrate it into their national penal codes alongside tough punishments for violators . faith leaders , too , should educate and sensitize their followers . all of the recruitment activity , advertising , and financial transactions associated with online child trafficking should also be criminalized . raising awareness about the issue is also critical , particularly in developing countries , where illiteracy , poverty , and a lack of age-responsive sex education in schools can leave children even more vulnerable . faith leaders , too , should educate and sensitize their followers .
special attention must be dedicated to rural regions , and those with special needs , an often-overlooked youth segment . in addition , communities need to increase access to contraception and other sexual-health services ; one way to do this would be to revive or establish youth-friendly spaces and centers where information can be shared . better guyana ’s life prospects are essential to improving guyana ’s young people . such spaces should be open after school and weekends , staffed by knowledgeable , sympathetic adults . if more teenagers have access to sex education and weekends , fewer girls would have their adult lives interrupted through their pregnancies .
mckinsey estimates that 30-45 % of the working-age population would prefer to earn an income , either primary or secondary , out of independent work . this suggests that stronger economics – and thus employment – would reduce the pool of workers engaged in independent work . but , regardless of macroeconomic conditions , there is probably independent work to account for a rising share of work in the long run , owing to technological advances and individual preferences . while digital platforms for autonomous work remain early on , employing only about 15 % of autonomous workers , they are both proliferating and thus spreading rapidly . many are low-income workers who would otherwise be unemployed .
in this they were realists , but they demanded measures of civic control by the authorities , in both the political and economic sphere . crucially , the protesters did not demand a free election . demanding the abolition of censorship was one of the first political slogans of the polish march ‘ 68 ’ . one slogan was “ no bread without freedom . ” demands for freedom of assembly and the right to organize themselves have not been called upon .
new haven – in what might well constitute the ultimate act of desperation , central banks are abdicating effective control of the economies that they were assigned to run . first came zero interest rates , then quantitative easing and now negative interest rates , one futile attempt begetting another . the adoption of negative interest rates , originally initiated in europe in 2014 , and now embraced in japan , represents a major turning point for central banking . just as the former two gambits have failed to gain meaningful economic traction in chronically weak recoveries , a shift to negative rates will merely compound the risks of financial instability and set the stage for the next crisis . the adoption of negative interest rates – originally initiated in europe in 2014 , and now embraced in japan – represents a major turning point for central banking .
as a result , demand now falls short of any binding constraint . true , the price of permits fell to less than € three a ton in april 2013 , rendering the emissions-trading market almost irrelevant . that would n’t happen if the price mechanism still underpinned a runaway climate-change policy . moreover , the eu ’s dependence on renewables has also proven itself to be ruinously expensive . this , in turn , has fueled greater reliance on high-polluting coal , the worst energy source , from the standpoint of global warming .
it will of course be important for the fund to focus on global imbalances rather than on the bilateral imbalance . in the multilateral trading system , large bilateral trade deficits often balance bilateral surpluses with other countries with a new currency . so , while china may have a trade deficit with the middle east and a trade surplus with america , those bilateral balances indicate nothing about china ’s overall contribution to the global imbalance . just as while china may want to have a trade deficit with the middle east and a trade surplus with america , those bilateral balances indicate nothing about china ’s overall contribution to the global imbalance . in fact , the challenge facing the imf today is formidable .
asked about their gut feelings , the majority of america ’s population ( 55 % ) in 2018 said that they had experienced stress during too many days , almost one-half ( 45 % ) said they felt a lot , and just over one in five ( 22 % ) said they felt a lot . stress , concern , and anger all of the hit ten-year america ’s highs in 2018 . america was the world ’s seventh-most stressed population in 2018 , less stressed than greece , the philippines , and iran , but still more stressed than uganda , turkey , and venezuela . asked about their gut feelings , the majority of americans ( 55 % ) in 2018 said they had experienced stress during much of this day , almost one-half ( 45 % ) said they felt worried about a lot , and more than one in five ( 22 % ) said they were feeling 6.9 . such stress measures are in line with another notable finding : americans ’ self-reported happiness has also declined in 2018 .
to that end , banks should make their values and culture integral to their hiring , firing , and promoting decision-making . employees need to understand instinctively what may happen , and what should never be done . to that end , banks should make their values and cultures integral to their hiring , firing , and promoting decision making . lasting reminders and repetition are essential . a written code – stress the commercial benefits of ethical business behavior and adverse effects of falling short – is part of this effort , and perhaps helpful to preserve and reinforce a culture ; but code alone is not enough .
islamabad – one hundred years ago , women in the united kingdom obtained the vote right , and today most women in the developed world are enfranchised . this is certainly true in pakistan , where a general election set for july 25 provides an ideal opportunity to advocate for change . at first sight , pakistan looks progressive , too . the law has allowed women to vote since 1956 , nearly a decade after independence from britain . but in many developing countries , the resistance that british suffragettes faced half a century ago , rooted in misogyny , persists .
the ecb famously raised interest rates twice in 2011 , just as the euro crisis was deteriorating , and unemployment skyrocketed to double-digit levels , bringing deflation ever closer . in some cases , the result has been unexpected : some lending rates have actually risen . they have continued to take advantage of old , discredited models of the past , perhaps slightly modified . none predicted the crisis ; and in very few of these economies , some semblance of full employment has been revived . the ecb famously raised interest rates twice in 2011 , just as the formal models and mental models that guide policymakers ’ think – were badly mistaken .
because he had no son to succeed him , mao did appoint a five-person politburo to do the job . its members , which included his nephew , mao yuanxin , his mistress , zhang yufeng , and jiang qing , his last wife , were just as incompetent at governing as kim , but following the disaster of the cultural revolution , antagonism toward them in the army and other state institutions was too widespread to last . but mao 's death did at least mark the end of an era of caesarism in china . china 's transit from caesarism to despotism and , then from marxism to capitalism , was fortunate for china 's citizens . because he did not have a son to succeed him , mao appointed a five-person politburo to do the job .
though communism could , each now and then coexist with private assets , and sometimes with private enterprise , it could never coexist with civil society as a whole . in ukraine , freedom of speech , about communism ’s fall , was revived overnight . but revitalizing civil society , the many mutually complementary ways in which citizens participate in public life , is a complicated task , as the peoples of egypt and tunisia will find out soon . we in ukraine have learned this truth from the harsh experience of the communist era . we in ukraine have learned this truth from the harsh experience of the communist era .
even more to the point : would trump quickly invoke the principle of collective defense under articles 5 of the nato treaty ? would he have called on putin to ask for what ’s going on ? and would putin have made another , unbelievable , offer to help the investigators get to the bottom line ? finally , imagine how trump might respond in kind . even more to the point : would trump have rapidly invoke the principle of collective defense under articles 5 of the nato treaty ?
but these outside risks are not making the outlook for global growth necessarily grim . so 2019 could turn out to be just another year of solid global growth . the baseline scenario for america remains robust growth . europe ’s growth could be above trend just as surely , for it is continuing its long , sluggish recovery from the start of the debt crisis . and china ’s economy has been proving doubters wrong for many years now .
i had even offered to do the areas of cost-benefit analysis for free . eugene scalia argued that the son of america ’s supreme court justice antonin scalia , the case against the sec was won in the american court of appeals , dc circuit , on a technicality – the sec ’s failure to conduct cost-benefit analysis ahead of time . at a conference last december , i asked sec vice chair mary schapter mary when her agency planned to reintroduce the rule . this small triumph turned into a major shareholder defeat when the sec , rather than performing any such analysis and re-proposing the rule , chose to stall . but she admitted that the sec had many other items on its agenda , and placed the issue at the back burner – a polite way to say that the sec , like heroic students in tiananmen square , has given up under irresistible pressure .
true , the fed ’s monetary-policy stance has been inadequate to stave off america ’s recession , though one that remains so mild that many doubt whether it qualifies as the real animal . but these are not normal times , either . in a brief , the major central banks on either side of the atlantic have been responding to the financial crisis , but they have not over-reacted . the european central bank ’s response has been analogous to the fed , but less reassuring , with monetary policy easier than the headline inflation rate would suggest . and , in western europe , too , gdp is now in decline .
when the opposition tried to question these inconsistencies , the eck abruptly proclaimed kibaki the winner . days later , the eck ’s chief executive publicly acknowledged that it had pressured kibaki ’s supporters to announce their “ results , ” immediately , despite glaring evidence of voter rigging . the election was a disaster for kenya , but the international community ’s response , led by america , is no less distressing . yet earlier this month , eu observers declared that it had not known who had actually won . shockingly , he declared , it did not know who really won .
it is also true that current global trade tensions have hit eurozone producers hard , particularly in germany . but it is hard for monetary policymakers to respond to the introduction of trade barriers . given that market-based measures currently clash with most other keynesian economic data , little weight should be annexed . furthermore , host of issues associated with risk premiums are forcing such indicators hard to interpret . unsurprisingly , current global trade tensions have hit eurozone producers hard , particularly in germany .
at first sight , it seems counter-intuitive that companies want to share data and potentially give away their competitive advantages . but pharmaceutical companies continue to hold out assumptions about the boundaries of pre-competitive collaboration , and that a closed operating model becomes financially sustainable . the drugs that do make it to markets must fund the cost of failure for those that did not make it go bust . but this presupposes that holding that data actually reveals a competitive advantage and that a closed , operating model becomes more sustainable . as a recently morgan stanley report pointed out , the pharmaceutical industry ’s current success rates are not enough to sustain big inside r & d organizations , making the industry the current operating model financially unviable .
though the iranian government might most be deterred from using a nuclear weapon , the price for a nuclear-armed iran might well give rise to a regional arms race , iran ’s nuclear-armed saudi arabia , possibly followed by turkey and egypt . despite tightening economic noose , the u.s. imposed sanctions against all firms doing business with iran ’s central bank , and the european union is planning to impose sanctions on iranian oil exports by late january , many of its nuclear experts now estimate that iran is very close to enriching sufficient uranium to build a bomb . nuclear weapons , components , and materials in a region already volatile and violent , and that determines the world ’s oil price , are a appalling scenario . to its credit iran to back up with steadily mounting sanctions have not produced results . the us market has carried out the measure of the last week ’s tensions , driving down the price of some oil contracts to its highest level in eight months .
the levy is an easy way to spread the political and financial costs of crises from some to all eu members . this levy , powerfully backed by those countries whose financial sectors are in tatters following the crisis , is hard to swallow for eu member states that have not intervened to bail out their banks . the post-crisis harmonization fervor in this area implies that it will now become more expensive everywhere in the eu to insure against currency volatility or unforeseen interest-rate changes . when claimed , bank capital will scarcer , credit flows slower , and bank fees higher in those countries with a fairly stable financial sector , simply because others have spent the fortune to support their financial systems , and because the european commission has never misses the opportunity to unify eu rules . the same is true , to instance , for an derivatives trading system .
learnup , the san francisco startup that attracted funding from some of silicon valley ’s largest venture capitalists , establishes partnerships with employers to offer online training modules that connect job seekers with particular jobs , primarily entry-level positions that do not require college degrees . employers foot the bill , with the expectation that learnup will help them recruit higher-quality claimants . employers foot the bill , with the expectation that learnup will help them recruit higher-quality claimants . and , indeed , as soon as the candidates finessed the training , learnup helps them to secure interviews with prospective employers , which already involve several big companies . learnup , the san francisco startup , which has attracted funding from some of silicon valley ’s largest venture-capital firms , sets partnerships with employers to offer online training modules that link job seekers with particular job centers , mostly entry-level positions that do not require college degrees .
suharto to – the military coup that overthrown egypt ’s first , democratically elected president , and led to arrests of muslim brotherhood leaders across the country poses an enormous danger not only to egypt ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s democratic transition , but also to its democratic hopes across the arab world as well . shia morsi ’s government seemed incapable of understanding that a slim electoral majority was inadequate , particularly nowadays . shia morsi ’s government seemed incapable of understanding that a slim electoral majority was inadequate , particularly nowadays . relinquishing the coup , together with massive popular support , was a mark of the great difficulty that the muslim brotherhood has faced during its first turn in power . president mohamed morsi ’s administration struggled to deal with egypt ’s inherited economic and social crises in the face of vast public expectations created by the revolution of 2011 , whose protagonists sought not only freedom , but also economic development and social justice .
paris – earlier this month , the trial of pascal simbikangwa , accused of their complicity in the genocide in rwanda , in which 800,000 people were killed between april and july 1994 , began in paris . sadly , the mass killings in africa are continuing . and french military intervention in the central african republic has not placed an end to severe inter-communal violence there . in south sudan , africa has a newest state , massacres of civilians continue to take place , particularly around pearl harbor . yet ironically , even as such episodes continue to spill over into africa , perhaps on a larger scale than elsewhere in the world , the continent has also become a beacon of hope .
europeans may not see this right now ( one sees more obama t-shirts in europe than america ’s ) , but perhaps not so happy if george bush iii comes along . moreover , with mounting concerns about america ’s fiscal sustainability , europe has a huge opportunity to play a significantly larger role as a reserve currency . surely , europe would lose traction as a badly needed counterweight to america in world economic policymaking . one shudders to think what happens when europe does not pull itself out of its current funk . certainly , europe would lose traction as a badly needed counterweight to america in world economic policymaking .
the third arrow is not the traditional industrial-policy-based approach . one logical solution would be to integrate more foreign labor into japan ’s economy . in contrast , it emphasizes labor reform , deregulation , and reduced the corporate-tax rate . a critical component of abe ’s growth strategy is to expand the labor force – a major challenge , given that japanese society is aging rapidly . that implies an unwillingness to focus on growth pending the deflation gap narrowed greatly , that is , until now .
what is certain is that the vacuum left by sharon , ’s departure from politics , is all the more striking given to images of the chaos unfolding from gaza that israel has vacated and the palestinian authority ’s collapse ahead of our eyes . the natural course of history at the indeed optimistic sense is the pace of progress “ at the margin , ” but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid advances in human affairs . many in us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by providential man , with all the hopes – and dangers – that this entails . nor will the emergence of yet another providential figure come easy . what is certain is that the vacuum left by sharon , ’s passing from politics , is all the more striking , because exceptional leaders may give the illusion that every problem has solutions that are far from true .
still , the uk has played a leading role in designing key eu policies , including action on the single market , overseas development aid , commerce , and climate change . the uk is in no position to block the other eu member states from deeper integration , owing to most other eu member states ’ political will to push ahead . indeed , the past year ’s negotiations on the eu ’s “ fiscal compact , ” were supposed to demonstrate to cameron the difficulty of exercising a so-called national veto . the uk leadership in those areas has been highly appreciated , and would be sowed to the extent that the british decide to leave . so , while the cameron government ’s support for deeper eurozone integration is a welcome sign , the eurozone can not , and will not , be shaped from outside and by british interests
in july of that year , robert s. ford , america ’s ambassador to syria , was sent to the sunni town of hama where assad ’s father had ordered his massacre 30 years earlier . according to the us state department at that time , the point of that visit was to “ [ expressing ] our deep support for the syrian people ’s right to assemble peacefully and to express themselves . ” already , it is clear that the obama administration did n’t know what it was bargaining for when , without thinking about what would come next , it was named in 2011 for assad ’s removal . but they will fault the u.s. for not uniting a bigger war . has the administration , in fact , failed to anticipate that assad , like his father before him , would be able to respond to a popular violence uprising ?
beijing – after years of intervening to manage the renminbi ’s exchange rate , china ’s central bank , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) , is under pressure to float the currency . the resulting capital inflows , if persistent , would generate upward pressure on the currency , forcing the central bank to pursue exchange-rate stability , intervening by selling the domestic currency , especially america ’s dollars , up to interest rates and money supplies , returned to its old levels . but striking the right balance between loosening its grip on the exchange rate and maintaining monetary stability will not be easy . indeed , if a country with a fixed exchange rate and an open capital account tightens monetary policy to contain inflation , rising domestic interest rates give market participants an incentive to borrow foreign currencies , and roll them out of domestic currencies for domestic-asset investment . all economics students are learning the mundell-fleming model stating that an economy can not maintain a fixed exchange rate , free capital movements , and independent monetary policies simultaneously .
by providing temporary tax relief , the scheme would help companies offset the administrative costs of establishing a profit-sharing program . american presidential candidate hillary clinton has a more narrowly focused proposal : a 15 % tax credit for the profits that companies distribute to their workers over the next two years . tax credit could also foster changes in corporate culture , by spurring the board-level debate not just of the benefits of profit-sharing , but also of sharing information and decision-making authority with employees . stagnant incomes for the majority of american workers undercut demand ( by discouraging household consumption ) and supply side effects ( through adverse effects on educational opportunity , human-capital development , and innovations ) . to address costs and prevent abuse , profits totaling more than 10 % on the top of a worker ’s pay would be excluded ; the overall sum offered to individual firms would be capped ; and safeguards against the substitution of us-style for-profit sharing for pay , raises , and other benefits would be established .
by contrast , the people seem to have become aware of putin ’s message that the establishment , at long last , is addressing corruption . and that message is straightforward : no one is safe from prosecution , even if , like abyzov and ishayev , they retire from public services , and no longer hold any sway . most russians see no connection between prosecuting key figures and those of the authorities ’ credibility . but it is the message for russia ’s beleaguered elites . moreover , selective repression has become harsher .
last week , at the oecd ’s sixth world forum on statistics , cognition , and policy in incheon , south korea , the group issued its report beyond gdp : measuring what counts for economic and social performance . the new report highlights a number of subjects , like trust and insecurity that were addressed merely briefly by mismeasuring our quality of life , and explores a few others , such as inequality and sustainability , more deeply . and it explains just how inadequate metrics have rendered deficient policies in a number of areas . the new report highlights several subjects , like trust and insecurity , that were merely addressed briefly by mismeasuring our quality of life , and explores a few others , such as inequality and sustainability , more deeply . it has also promoted a successor to the commission , high level experts on how to measure economic performance and social progress .
seventy-three years ago , john maynard keynes thought about financial-market reform and regulation from the first three purposes , and he found himself “ moved toward … mak [ ing ] the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble , like a marriage ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” for keynes , however , we remain frozen today . but he immediately drew back : the fact is that every individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is patently “ liquid ’ ( though this can not be true for all investors collectively ) calms up his nerves and makes him far more willing to run risk … ” but he has immediately drew back : the fact is that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is ‘ liquid ’ ( though this can not be true of all investors collectively ) calms his nerves and makes him far more willing to run risk … ” moreover , for keynes , even in the face of a severe financial crisis , we remain frozen today . it is for these reasons that we appeared to be frozen over the last generation , or two whenever we contemplated reforming our system of financial regulation . and it is precisely why , even in the face of a severe financial crisis , we remain frozen today .
perhaps the most outrageous example is america , at $ 0.54 per gallon of import tariff on ethanol , whereas there is zero merchandise tariff , compared to just $ 0.5 per gallon tax on gasoline . this contrasts with a $ 0.51 per gallon subsidy by which us firms ( a huge proportion that goes to a single us firm ) receive ethanol . enormous subsidies have meant that america has become the world ’s largest ethanol producer . yet , despite this enormous benefit , at least some foreign firms still can still make it to the american market . this contrasts with a $ 0.51 per gallon subsidy that us firms ( a huge portion that goes to a single us firm ) receive on ethanol .
moreover , the topic remains highly sensitive : while public-opinion polls in 2012 indicated for the first time a small majority in favor of legalization , their opponents remain vehement . the legal and political challenges implied are no minor matter : marijuana remains the illicit substance under america ’s federal legislation and international conventions , which america enacted . moreover , the subject remains highly sensitive : while public-opinion polls in 2012 indicated for the first time a small majority in favor of legalization , their opponents remain vehement . just as important was us president barack obama ’s reaction to the colorado and washington vote , the two states that he won easily in his reelection bid . the results have not only created a conflict between american federal legislation and state legislation , but also signal a shift in attitudes not dissimilar to that regarding same-sex marriage .
some four million northerners were denied political participation or land ownership on the grounds that they were the descendants of migrants from neighboring countries . their political upheavals of 1999-2000 resulted in a new , more “ democratic , democratic ” constitution that became an invitation to civil war . regional and religious tensions were on the rise ever since houphouet ’s death , and were aggravated by a new constitution that enshrined in ethnic discrimination . the result has been disastrously wrong , as it exacerbated ethnic rivalries . regional and religious tensions were on the rise ever since houphouet ’s death , and were aggravated by a new constitution that enshrined ethnic discrimination .
these governments want to establish an educational system , according to which the state alone decides which fields of research are necessary and society as a whole socially . in the long run , they probably also want the state to grant political loyalists the right to produce and transfer knowledge . in other words , access to knowledge stops being a civil right . political trustworthiness determines who can teach and study what about a country and its history . these are highly educated people who know that knowledge is power , there is an obvious agenda , and take advantage of the fact that education in europe is the responsibility of national governments , not brussels-based bodies .
mark leonard , the european council ’s director of the council on foreign relations , and vice chair of the world economic forum ’s new global agenda council on geo-economics , noted that interdependence , formerly economic boon , has now become a threat almost as often . fragile institutions have given rise to the political backlash and the dangers of catastrophe on multiple fronts . despite all of its undeniable advantages , it has toned down governance and management problems that exposed the inadequacies of national governments and international institutions . this has left people everywhere ; rich and poor alike struggling to confront problems – from the failed states to failing banks ; from over-fishing to under-business ; from climate change to economic stagnation to economic stagnation ; to which globalization contributed but can not address effectively . dubai – a cause of globalization , as so many have noted recently – is in retreat .
london – for two decades , chinese diplomacy has been guided by the concept of the country ’s peaceful rise . today , however , what china needs is a new strategic doctrine , for the most noteworthy aspect of sri lanka ’s recent triumph over the tamil tigers is not its crushing character , but the fact that china provided president mahinda rajapaska in both the military base and the diplomatic cover he needed to prosecute a war . on sri lanka ’s beachfront battlefields , china ’s much-vaunted “ peaceful rise ” was complete . so , not only has china become central to every aspect of the global economy ’s finances and economic system ; it has now shown its strategic effectiveness in a region traditionally outside of its orbit . without that chinese being backed , rajapaska ’s government would have neither the thought nor the willingness to ignore world opinion in his offensive against the tamil tigers .
when alexander hamilton , america ’s first treasury secretary , mutualized state ’s debts in 1791 , he thought that this would cement the new american nation . should the euro break up and gipsic countries default , germany alone would lose some € 545 billion , nearly half of the aggregate sum that the bundesbank had implemented most of the net payments in the name of gipsic countries , in addition to the target balances . but mutualizing debt amounted to an enormous moral hazard effects , motivating states to borrow excessively . germany has the largest exposure by far among the countries rescuing the eurozone ’s crisis-stricken countries , and thus helping to ease austerity more than any other country . george soros is underestimating the risks that debt mutualized would pose to the eurozone ’s future .
hong kong – looking back over 2016 , there might seem little to celebrate . beyond stories of hospitals in conflict zones to be bombed , the zika virus has emerged as a mounting threat . there has also been the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant infections or “ superbugs , ” ” ” ” ” the continued revival of yellow fever , as well as polio reemergence in nigeria , which previously had been declared polio-free . against the backdrop of global health on its own , the year has shown one of unrelenting tragedy . hopes for the respiratory syncytial virus have been dashed .
this dynamic can be seen amid a trend toward bank consolidation and branch closings , which have accelerated since the 2008 financial crisis and reduced access to services in low-income communities . during the new deal era , regulators included the functional equivalent of such a requirement in charters for bank and thrifts . but such mandates have been de-emphasized during a wave of deregulation in the 1980s , with banks rapidly moving away from low-cost financial services and toward high-profit-making activity . history also shows us that financial exclusion is a persistent problem whenever universal service requests are absent . when it comes to ensuring equity in banking , those precedents , and existing institutions are pointing the way forward .
by december 2016 , then-us secretary of state john kerry told the united states congress that direct talks between israel and palestine were going “ “ poof ” – when israel announced 700 new homes for israelis in the west bank . it is n’t difficult to imagine what palestinian negotiators had to feel as they drove out the us ’s massive israeli settlements on territories that they had been working to include themselves in an independent state . after all , it was obama who enabled the un security council to vote on that trump-derided resolution declaring israel ’s settlement construction a major obstacle ” to the two-state solution . this has not been lost on all us leaders . after all , it was not hard to imagine what palestinian negotiators had to feel as they drove with the massive israeli settlements on territories that they had been working to contain in an independent state .
new haven : across europe and america , the men in the black tie and women in kenzo and armani gowns are once more summer pilgrims to places like bayreuth , glyndebourne , and the glimmerglass . time and again here , too , there is , once again , time to ask , once again a fundamental question : should the state continue to ladle out generous subsidies to such elite business ? does its grandeur mean that the state is supposed to subsidize it ? consider a thing of incontrovertible beauty and spiritual depth : a roman catholic high mass . does its grandeur mean that the state is supposed to subsidize these privileged retreats ?
on defense and warfare , this contrast includes the possibility of youth dying in action . but foreign policy , as we have known it , is basically a manifestation of a national state or a superpower . so a key characteristic of foreign policy integration , therefore , is that governments can not know in advance what to do about it . this contrast underlines the fact that the great successes of eu integration have taken place under that strain of no-man 's – land that lies between full-scale national autonomy and an utter loss of sovereignty in a confederation . this is not surprising , therefore , that much progress in foreign policy integration has made governments unable to know .
lebanon often struggles to attract funding because of its status as a middle-income country , but that label is misleading , because it does not account for any of the truly structural vulnerabilities that pre-date the syrian crisis , or an enormous share of a resident population composed of refugees from syria , palestine , and iraq living in abject poverty . without any additional aid from the international community , our vision will not realize this , despite strong political will and rigorous planning . i am thankful to us donors that at the start , but now we need additional international support . we are facing a $ 100 million shortfall for a new college year . lebanon often struggles to attract financing because of its status as a middle-income country , but that label is misleading , because it ignores the grave structural vulnerabilities that pre-date the syrian crisis or the huge influx of a resident population composed of refugees from syria , palestine , and iraq living in abject poverty .
part of the problem , of course , is that we make resolutions to do only things that we are not otherwise likely to do as well . what does this tell us , then , of human nature to try to alter the behavior that may be hardest to change . only an anorexic will resolve to eat its ice cream at least one week , and only a workaholic will resolve to spend more time in front of the tv . so we are now using the occasion of the new year to try to change the behavior that may turn out to be the ones that are hardest hit by change . what , then , will tell us of human nature and our power to live prudently or ethically ?
clearly , the fed needs to take a deep look at its forecasting methodology and policymaking processes . a second conclusion to draw from the current situation is that the fed has now overestimated america ’s economy ’s strength for 11 consecutive years . elementary mathematics dictates that credible forecasts should , at least , overestimate about half this time and under-shoot half it . the likelihood of this happening is one in a 2,048 , and could not be enough . if each year of the fed ’s forecasting was the codependent toss , we would now have had eleven high heads on a row and the zero tails .
such is the nature of the imperfect trustworthiness of psychiatric diagnosis , but it seems to be the basis of scientific evidence . that is the nature of the imperfect trustworthiness of psychiatric diagnosis . any study trying to determine whether a psychiatric disorder has been over-diagnosed will find that some patients of the state do not actually have it upon reinterview . but we seem to think that the over-diagnosis rate of over 50 % will cross the threshold of clinical utility . that question , then , is not whether some patients previously given the diagnosis will seem not to have it upon reinterviews , but rather how much .
indeed , in the great depression of the 1930 ’s , it was common for western intellectuals to turn to communism and central planning as a hoped-for panacea . policymakers will continue to cast whatever ammunition they can find at the problem , but it will take time for deleveraging from the boom to run its course . at a time of severe economic hardship , policymakers thrash out how to seek solutions , causing some people to lose confidence in the economic system itself . indeed , in the great depression of the 1930 ’s , it was common for western intellectuals to turn to communism and central planning as a hoped-for panacea . this time , virtually every economy is suffering substantially , and a banking crisis is global .
washington , dc – steve bannon is expansive travels in europe this year , barely drawn as much attention as he was supposed to do , given the key theorem of us president donald trump ’s signature brand of nationalism . bannon now wants to build a pan-european federation of nationalist parties . by joining forces with the french far-right leader marine le pen , himself an open supporter of russian president vladimir putin , bannon seems to have in mind a new kind of “ neo-nationalist international . ” and yet one wonders how an “ america first ” ideologue could pursue his own political project anywhere other than in america . as more countries transform themselves into “ nationalistic liberal autocracies ” and “ illiberal democracies ” under strongman rule , nationalism has become an ideological common denominator .
diplomatic immunity from local prosecution was an idea that sprang straight from another incident almost a century earlier , involving the arrest of the former russian aristocrat , micrey matveyev , who represented peter the great in london . one notorious event , in the late eighteenth century , was lord macartney ’s british mission to the imperial tribunal of china . as a result , the mission broke down . diplomatic immunity from local prosecution was an idea that sprang straight from another incident nearly a century earlier , involving the arrest of the russian aristocrat , micrey matveyev , who represented peter the great in london . macartney refused to conform to the chinese imperial protocol by declining kowtow to the emperor because it was not required to do equal status with his own sovereign .
assume that the interest rate on ten-year bonds remains unchanged over the next five years , and then rises from 2 % to less than 5 % . over the course of those five years , the investors earns an additional 2 % every year , for a cumulative gain of 10 % . but when the interest rate on the ten-year bond yields rises to 5 % , the bond ’s price-earnings drop from $ 100 to $ 69 would be higher than it would be through an investment in treasury bills or bank deposits . during those five years , the investor earns an additional 2 % , for a cumulative gain of 10 % . assume that the interest rate on ten-year bonds remains unchanged over the next five years , and then rises from 2 % to 5 % .
only the world of political-military and economic heavyweights , the major industrialized countries that remain by far the largest hydrocarbon consumers , can initiate change on a global scale . the g-8 countries should therefore agree not to license any new , oil-powered cars at their head at the end of 2025 . that decision would be directed not toward individual mobility , but toward the dissipation of a scarce resource that makes synthetic materials more urgent . political leaders should not privilege any particular technology . change must start in the transport sector , which accounts for more than half of current oil consumption , a share that is likely to rise in the future .
ithaca – america ’s president-elect donald trump has , once again , succeeded in turning facts on their head . as part of a broader effort to take china to task for the supposedly “ raping ” of the united states economy through unfair trade policies , he has now renewed accusations that the country manipulates its currency to amass an advantage over its exports . make no mistake : trump ’s accusation of chinese currency manipulation does not support the facts . by contrast , for the past two and a half years , the people of china ( pboc ) have been intervening in currency markets just to the opposite end : to prevent the renminbi ’s value from falling too sharply against the dollar . statements like these are as dangerous as unmoored from reality .
new delhi – late last month , when two indian states and national capital held to ransom by rioting mobs in exchange for two counts of raping small girls , many indians found themselves confronting several painful truths about their country . in 2002 , two of these adherents mustered the courage to press charges . the leader who cracked down on these protests is gurmeet singh , one of a more prominent of a few “ godman , ” ” ” ” or self-proclaimed spiritual leaders who flourish across india . and it has a reputation for sexually exploiting its female followers . the flamboyant , golden bedecked singh calls baba gurgurmeet ram rahim singh insan , a hindu , muslim compound and sikh – followed by the word for “ human ” in hindi , punjabi , and the urdu .
to be sure , certain imports would become more expensive for iran ; but the economic effect of such sanctions remains limited . europeans , on the other hand , continue to believe that iran would abandon its enrichment program , if only the european union imposed unilateral sanctions . politically , however , ahmadinejad surely would not miss his chance to take advantage of unilateral actions for propaganda purposes , claiming that iran has conflicts not with the international community , but with imperialist states intent on depriving his country of technological progress . for these reasons , europeans favor a new security council resolution , even though its actions are weaker than what the united states or the eu could unilaterally impose . politically , however , a clear-headed analysis of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’s behavior indicates that eu sanctions would result in more trade diversion , with china , russia , turkey , or dubai benefiting from reduced levels of european exports to iran .
and yet it shares right-wing populists ’ hostility to liberal academics , journalists , and intellectuals . abe and his allies are attempting to quash that influence . his effort to revise japan ’s pacifist constitution , restore pride in its wartime record , and discredit “ elitist ” mainstream media like the left-of-center , left-of-center newspaper asahi shimbun , made him the praise of donald trump ’s former chief strategist , stephen bannon , who challenged abe in the first place before trump . nobody could be more identified with the political elite than abe , the grandson of a wartime cabinet minister , and the later prime minister and prime minister , and the son of foreign minister . postwar japanese democracy was influenced by the 1950 ’s and 1960s by an intellectual elite that had consciously sought to distance japan from its wartime nationalism .
african countries , on the other hand , often see the worst sides of multinational corporations : power , mineral , and precious metal companies go where the resources are , not where they delightful to work . as one former mining chief executive in the region told me , “ the aim has always been straightforward : getting assets out of the ground and out of the country as cheaply , and with as little fuss as possible . ensuring high-quality output and local consumers ’ fidelity requires keeping their workforces happy and maintaining their positive public image . but sub-saharan africa ’s potential relations with global corporations need not be so constrained . because customers are abroad and little processing is needed in a country , why should companies upgrade local competencies or otherwise help the host economy ?
the boom mentality spread through los angeles , new york , and sydney around 1997 , to paris in 1998 , miami , moscow and shanghai in 2001 , and vancouver around 2002 . these and other cities have been booming pretty much ever since ; prices in most of these cities are at least 50 % or more in real terms since 2000 . now rising home prices are weakening in some of these cities as a result . the first big city to boom was london , started around in 1996 . this created a huge windfall for homeowners , but hurt any planning to buy them .
after two and a half decades of market-oriented economic reform , chinese citizens are increasingly recognizing how to protect their own economic and social interests through the rule of law . the government employs a host of new legal regulations , the shadowy internet police force , and the powerful hardware-based national information filtering scheme . control also relies on internet users ’ demography , most of which belongs to china ’s economic elite , and , more than ever , are more likely to be adopted by the internet as part of newfound consumer lifestyles than it was as an instrument of political or social revolutions . at the same time , what is surprising is that the mechanisms of government control have been largely effective . control also relies on internet users ’ demography , most of whom belong to china ’s economic elite , and something strengthened -- and compounded -- not only by the economy ’s rapid diffusion , but by the continuing proliferation of the internet .
as a result , nationally elected representatives are ultimately responsible for making crucial eu-level decisions . but , whereas common european causes are arising on a daily basis , they do not have europe-wide political representation . no single political party or politician in brussels can make a claim to european citizens of their own , because none has to compete for europe-wide public support . individual nation-states , regions , and special-interest groups are representative within the eu . as a result , nationally elected representatives are ultimately responsible for making pivotal eu-level decisions .
although a president ’s advisers may change , one would think that the candidates will acknowledge them , if only to suggest where their own ideas come from ; after all , realistically what they are selling is their ability to judge and manage expertise , rather than their own abilities as economists . likewise , obama originally had a marvel team of economic advisers , including lawrence summers , christina romer , austan goolsbee , and cass sunstein . this time , too , was no mention , in fact , of the name of any deep economic thinker , or of any particular economic model . and yet america ’s presidential campaigns have generally neglect to debate advisers or intellectual influences . is there anything more , really , one can ask of a president ?
after all , only the ingrained habit of playing second fiddle to america is preventing eu members from being clearly and loudly distancing themselves from israel ’s repressive interat the west bank and gaza , though such a stance would help to cement the arab states ’ commitment to a coalition against terrorism , just as it provides a useful shove to american diplomacy . in short , they will need to make their own efforts distinct from their own . what that each of these powerful contribution could not be hard to define . simply put , they can not wait for america ’s transition ; nor can they always seek to seek a placate washington , dc ’s preferences . for another , they will need to engage their own , distinct contribution .
as a result , medical professionals often know little about the symptoms and biology of these diseases . one reason for this is that the small numbers of patients are making study illnesses and testing drugs a difficult job . the topic has been an obscure but large-scale collection ( more than 70 ) of diseases caused by a specific kind of genetic error , one that takes place in cell machinery that chemically attaches sugars to proteins and lipids . as a result , medical professionals frequently know little about the symptoms and biology of these illnesses . earlier this year , i participated in the rare rates of disease in pennsylvania .
markets become rigged , justice becomes transactional , and policymakers sell themselves to the top bidder . although corruption is more a symptom than the cause of ukraine ’s problems , a culture of corruption must be uprooted before conditions can improve . in ukraine , even universities are endangered : degrees are routinely bought and sold . one might suppose that this simply requires a powerful state with the means to uproot corrupt politicians and businessmen . in ukraine , even universities are endangered : degrees are routinely bought and sold .
in israel , obama will encounter a country that has actually migrated but not to the missing center . “ the red lines ” ” ” ” in israel have the means of mutating into lines that are then making them invisible at the slightest wind . in israel , by contrast , settlements offer cheaper housing than is available in israel , thereby resolve one of the country ’s main economic problems . again , the new government , ’s fragile equilibrium , has only reinforces this sober interpretation . nor should anyone expect a moratorium on settlement expansion .
as a result , the ratio of fiscal revenue to total spending this fiscal year has fallen to less than 50 % for the first time in japan ’s postwar history . japan had a similar experience during the 1990 ’s , the country with the so-called “ lost decade ” that had run its course . at that time , japan ’s fiscal deficit soared after the country ’s property bubble burst , triggering economic stagnation . despite japan ’s weaknesses in its fiscal position , the market for japanese government bonds ( jgbs ) remains stable , at least for now . if the government continues on this path , many anticipate next year ’s budget deficit to widen further .
yet zimbabwe ’s neighbors , particularly those in southern africa , have defended president mugabe . their catalogue of crimes includes : stealing the 2002 elections that allowed mugabe to hold on to power ; bturing and murdering supporters of the opposition movement for democratic change ; the transformation of a fertile , prosperous country once thought africa ’s breadbasket into a place where half the population barely survives on overseas food handouts ; and exemplified by its attacks on daily news , the suppression of critical mass voices . in late august , the heads of state of the 13 members of the southern african development community ( sadc ) , including mugabe and president thabo mbeki of south africa , the leading regional powers , met in dar es salaam , tanzania , to weigh the challenges before them . among the 54 paragraphs of the summit final communiqué , two dealt zimbabwe with . mugabe ’s regime acted in the wake of outrage .
california , wyoming , and other states have allowed women to function like what judge brandeis called the laboratories of democracy by experimenting with innovative policies without putting the rest of the country at risk . california , wyoming , and other states have allowed women to function like what judge brandeis called the laboratories of democracy by experimenting with innovative policies without putting the rest of the country at risk . there is a long , rich history of successful experimentation . the state and local governments have been leaders in establishing public primary and secondary education systems , as have states ’ colleges and universities . there is a long , rich history of successful experimentation .
should higher nominal ( that is , inflation-fueled ) growth substitute for debt-driven growth ? europe must aim for sustainable , non-inflationary growth and the creation of competitive jobs . the current inflation rate of 0.3 % is the result of the significant decline in commodity prices , and painful but unavoidable adjustments of costs and prices in the peripheral countries . only greece currently has a slightly negative inflation rate . in other words , price stability reappears within the eurozone .
the implication is that speculators may be able to drive down prices , increasing their inventories even as total commercial inventories remain little . thus , record-high speculative prices have probably caused bunker traders to let down inventory stores , but those releases may have bought into speculators who are now active lessees of their commercial storage capacity . proving to be responsible for higher prices is always tricky , for it tends to run against the backdrop of powerful fundamentals . the additionally , the oil-price speculation may have spurred “ echo speculation , ” ” ” ” whereby ultimate users buy refined products in advance to shield against future price hikes . they then take delivery on their premises in order to prevent total refined inventories from rising , but that increase is not part of the reported commercial inventories .
furthermore , the disintegration that the region has already witnessed , and will undoubtedly continue to witness , will reverberate beyond the arab map with the creation of a sovereign kurdish state . but the two states lack the domestic revenues needed to sustain their institutions . if they wish to survive well in the next century , they will probably have to subsumed under the union backed by a larger , stronger , and more established nation-state . such a state , whether by disempowerment de facto or with widespread formal recognition , will have an enduring impact across the arab world ’s borders ( syria and iraq ) and the broader middle east ( turkey and iran ) . the arab spring has reawakened some regimes , though not others .
we tend to think that new kinds of risk-management products , such as novel types of insurance or financial derivatives , will chiefly interest the rich , or at least the relatively affluent among us . thus , risk management , by smoothing out bumps in income , may prove to be especially important in alleviating the effects of poverty . good fortunes and the bad fortune alternate randomly , and the poorest people are especially vulnerable when unhappiness , like a hurricane in a fishery village , comes to mind . in effect , new risk-management products are in place for some of the poorest people in africa , asia , and latin america . so risk management , by smoothing out bumps in income , can be especially important in alleviating the effects of poverty .
that the disconnect is nothing new ; there have always been tsars and serfs , the politburo commissars , and the proletariat . indeed , even russian uniformity is , historically , very different in terms of the nowadays . today , everybody is dealing with life and hardships individually ( a new word in our daily vocabulary ) , regardless of any kremlin wish to make living uniform . that postcommunist boris yeltsin , however , though he sometimes proclaimed allegiance to the hazy collective sense of rossiyane ( citizens of russia ) , deprived of – or set of – that question , russians of all their collective lives ; both real life of shared hardship and an imaginary semi-life of communist solidarity . in novelod i saw lukoil ( one of russia ’s big private oil companies ) gasoline stations .
a new system , in which “ reversible bonds ” have replaced quotas and desirability screenings , would diminish such competition , while mitigating the risks to destination and resource countries . greater international cooperation would maximize the benefits of immigration , while providing it , thereby maximizing the benefits of immigration . but , despite the potential benefits of collaborative efforts to control illegal immigration , most countries , including the us and the united kingdom , are seeking to reform their immigration laws unilaterally . irreversible bonds would act as an insurance mechanism for both sides , shielding destination countries from fiscally motivated immigration and protecting source countries against the costs implied by the loss of talented recruits . they view collaboration as infeasible , given the natural competition between destination and source countries for their most productive members .
denmark , the top-performing european country , has recorded miserly 0.7 % average annual growth over the last six years . every downturn , it finally comes , comes to an end . denmark , the austerity policies embraced by many governments , is that they made the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary , with long-run consequences . real ( inflation-adjusted ) gdp per capita is lower in much of the north atlantic than it was in 2007 ; in greece , the economy has shrunk by an estimated 23 % . denmark , the top-performing european country , has recorded miserly 0.7 % average annual growth over the past six years .
warsaw – twenty-five years ago , poland ’s people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot , cardinal karol wojtyla of cracow , as the pope . his first return visit to his native poland soon came afterwards to show for all of the world that a new pope ’s power would be . some were frightened , others sipped in search of joy . here , a prominent novelist voiced “ poland ’s second christchurch . ” but even during our euphoria , we failed to anticipate how much the new pope would change not only poland , but also the world .
though the hong kong courts surely could have settled on the matter by themselves under an “ one country , two systems ” framework , hong kong is assured of an independent judiciary , in addition to the right to choose its own legislature , which has enraged china has intervened . restraint , after all , is not a leninist virtue . in an extraordinary move , china ’s national people ’s congress standing committee stepped in to “ clear the article 104 , ” declaring that all of the oaths that office-holders had to be “ solemn , accurate , finessed and sincere . ” to most hong kong ’s lawyers , the display of political authority constituted not simply a reinterpretation of the old rules , but a move towards making new ones new . restraint , after all , is not , after all , a leninist virtue .
prodded by groups like the workers rights consortium and an ethical trading initiative , some corporations promise to pay living wages , open their factories to monitors , and even give employees a voice to the workplace . but sensitivity to human rights has done nothing to staunch trade unionism ’s declining global decline . the institute of international labor organization reports that trade unions are in retreat in most nations . the reinstatement , a multinational sportswear firm , advertises its corporate code as being “ founded on core tenets ” of the un ’s universal declaration of human rights . standing up for grabs , a multinational sportswear firm , advertises its corporate code as “ founded on the core ” of the un ’s universal declaration of human rights .
new york – the 12 member countries of africa have international conference on the great lakes region have committed to a similar mandatory requirements of due-diligence . the securities and exchange commission requires companies that exploit tantalum , tin , gold , or tungsten in their products to investigate these raw materials ’ origins , as well as to cushion risks in their supply chains on lines consistent with oecd guidelines , if they are found to originate in some conflict-affected or high-risk areas . that is as it should be . the united states has already taken the next logical step in this regard . the 12 member countries of africa ’s international conference on the great lakes region have committed themselves to a similar type of mandatory due-diligence requirements .
most of their productive and financial assets are owned by foreign companies , just as most of the rules that govern their economies have been so committed to the eu . illiberal cee nationalists such as hungarian prime minister victor orbán like to argue that they are defending national sovereignty from the bureaucrats in brussels . cameron ’s initiative plays right into hand , allowing orbán and his allies in neighboring countries to declare anathema to their citizens ’ rights or to use eu financial transfers to build patron-client relationships and reinforce their hold over the state . the truth , however , is that there is little at stake for cee countries to lose sight of sovereignty . cameron will conclude that they can have it on their own , hold the benefits of economic integration , without losing their capacity to infringe on their citizens ’ rights or use of eu financial transfers to build patron-client relationships and legitimacy .
one concern among the critics is that the shift toward a green economy will , in essence , monetize nature , exposing the world ’s forests , fresh water , and fisheries to profit in terms of behavior by bankers and traders – whose shortcomings have helped trigger the kind of financial and economic turmoil of the last four years . systemic crises in the food , fuel , and finance that came onstream in 2008 , and that are occurring in many countries , have their origins in the economic paradigm that has failed to account for the value of nature and its array of life-supporting services . indeed , amid deep-seated and pervasive market failures , in terms of carbon emissions , biodiversity , and ecosystem services , we are accelerating the ecological and ecological risks , undermining human well-being and social equity . that is why the connection to governance and institutions at rio +20 is just as important as the transition to a green economy : markets are the human development that demands rules and institutions to guide not just its direction , but also its boundaries . as the just-released report “ in the direction of a green economy : pathways to sustainable development and poverty-eradication ” shows , a market economy as it is currently constituted has resulted in selling capital on an unprecedented scale .
by that standard , does my ill-informed criticism of hamas ’s rocket attacks make me an islamophobe ? coincidentally , the deadly attack on gaza has arrived at the same moment that a clutch of america ’s most distinguished would-be middle eastern peacemakers have published books on how the task should be tackled properly . an italian cardinal who admittedly spoke intemperately has been accused of using the language of holocaust denial . it all sounded a little like a series of occupation requests – a war for president barack obama ’s eyes . third , as usual , israel has accused of anti-semitism of those daring to criticize its disproportionate response to hamas ’s indefensible rocket attack and its collective punishments by the palestinians .
a similar political imperative lies at the heart of the brand of sinhalese chauvinism that has made a sudden return to public life in sri lanka . rajapaksa ’s unexpected defeat by sri lanka ’s center-left democrats and tamil political parties in last january ’s presidential election was an outcome that he then sought to annul both of his own career and that of race-baiting politics . but , rather than seeking reconciliation with the tamils following their defeat , then-president mahinda rajapaksa has continued to play on ethnic hatred as he subverted sri lanka ’s democracy . so the religious and ethnic passions of the sinhalese have been emboldened during the last january , the bloody pushback that he then sought to annul sri lanka ’s quarter-century of civil war with the tamil tigers in 2009 . but , rather than seeking reconciliation with the tamils following their defeat , then-president mahinda rajapaksa has continued to play on ethnic hatred as he subverted sri lanka ’s brand of democracy .
these are not isolated examples of children caught in the crossfire ; this is what will happen when classrooms become the actual targets for terrorists who see education as a threat . these are not isolated examples of children caught in the crossfire ; this is what will happen when classrooms become the actual targets of terrorists who see education as a threat . in at least 30 countries , there is a concerted pattern of attacks by armed groups , with afghanistan , colombia , pakistan , somalia , sudan , and syria the worst affected . schools around the world , from north america to northern nigeria , now require security plans to ensure their pupils ’ safety and provide a degree of trust for their parents and communities . such attacks reveal with stark clarity , which provides schooling the opportunity not just of blackboards , books , and curricula .
some , such as tent , encourage companies to hire refugees and integrate them into the supply chains on which they live . modest seed financing can go a long way toward assisting refugee-owned businesses get off the ground . modest seed financing can go a long way toward assisting refugee-owned businesses get off the ground . global organizations are tapping into tech-savvy refugees and hiring them for online work . meanwhile , somalia ’s companies and organizations , including wework , ikea , and starbucks , are developing innovative approaches to recruiting refugees .
next month , representatives from more than 190 countries will meet in august el sheikh hasina , egypt , for the fourteenth meeting of the parties ’ conference for the convention on biological diversity ( the un biodiversity conference ) . while there , they will weigh on whether to press the brakes on gene drives , ensuring that african farmers and indigenous peoples consult fully before such technologies are unleashed within their communities . one hopes that the international community will uphold its obligation to protect food supplies , much as the rights of farmers around the world . that is why it has become increasingly rejected in favor of the agro-ecological model based on the principle of “ food sovereignty . ” the latter approach , endorsed by the un human rights council , calls on farmers to share existing knowledge and seeds with one another and protects local ecosystems .
it is not exactly clear how long venezuela ’s hugo chávez was , indeed , dead before his passing was formally announced . the information vacuum was reminiscent of the secrecy surrounding the deaths of stalin and mao , and the practice in the ottoman empire of keeping sultan ’s death a secret for weeks , until the succession remained standing in the ground . buying time to secure his own political future , venezuelan officials carefully stage-managed chávez ’s thuggish illness and eventual demise , even suggesting near the end while he underwent complicated and agonizing cancer treatments to continue to be “ walking and posting . ” the mise-en-scene manipulation surrounding chávez ’s death seems certain to translate into electoral support for his grey successor , nicolás maduro . but will this suffice to produce a chávista lineage ?
likewise , governments in developed countries have a role to play in influencing the nature of technological innovation . too often , they subsidize labor-replacing , capital-intensive technologies , rather than pushing innovation in socially more beneficial directions , to augment rather than substitute for less-skilled workers . such policies are unlikely to make a lot of difference for the developing world . requiring the quality standards needed to deliver global value chains can not be met easily by replacing machines with manual labor . for them , the main constraint will remain that existing technologies enable an insufficient range of factor substitution : using less-skilled eu members or physical capital .
berkeley – on january 20 , 2017 , american president-elect donald trump will assume office has received nearly three million fewer votes than his opponent ; and he will work with the republican senate majority , whose house house members have won 13 million fewer votes than their democratic adversaries . with only the republican majority in the house of representatives , led by speaker paul ryan , has any claim to represent a numeracy majority for the 55 % of americans who voted on an election day in 2016 . trump will also start his presidency with an approval rating below 50 % . so far , the government of the world ’s oldest democracy is not democratic at all . this is unprecedented – or “ unpresidented , ” as one of its semi-literate tweets put it ( before deleting it ) , in the history of such ratings .
the s-400 dispute is just the latest example of how military procurement matters has created a rift between turkey and its western allies . in turkey ’s view , its western partners have not done enough , via technology transfer and joint-production regimes , to accommodate its burgeoning defense-industrial defenses . by contrast , the chinese , and to a lesser extent , russian firms have become much more receptive to such turkish demands as some of the latter ’s differing threat perceptions and alliances in the syria conflict . and domestic deftness industry interests are only part of the story . more broadly , both turkey and the west are experiencing political , strategic , and geopolitical decoupling , reflected most recently by each side ’s differing threat perceptions and alliances in the run-up to the war in syria .
this is not to say that our responses to the perils that are emerging from the legacies of the past must be rooted in history . underdevelopment in many of the southern countries that are faring poorly in their struggle to remain viable in a globalizing world , creates the conditions for desperate poverty , ecological breakdowns , and rootless , unemployed populations beyond the control of the atrophying of state systems . as we embark on the still-new millennium , though it seems ironically that it may be due to tomorrow ’s possible disorder , in no small part to yesterday ’s colonial order . the us will not build a better world in the 21 st century by forgetting what happened at the age of 19 , and much of the 2020s . more needs are needed than ever for innovative , forward-looking approaches to global governance .
in bilateral negations with moscow , american officials have been bidding up four concrete bmd collaboration projects : · expanded nato-russian theater-level bmd exercises that are building on previous collaboration , disrupt russia ’s august 2008 georgian war , and which rehearse how deployed nato and russian-us forces can jointly advocate against missile threats ; · joint us-russian expert studies on how bmd could affect russia ’s nuclear-deterrent capabilities and what steps can be taken to minimize potential trouble ; · a bi-national and multi-national jointly staffed centers where russian personnel can see an unthreatening nature of us and nato missile-defense activities ; · an underlying legal framework to support these and other cooperative projects . · a joint euro-legal framework to underpin these and other cooperative projects .
his and congressional republicans ’ attempts to replace the affordable care act ( obamacare ) , as well as to curtail growth in medicaid spending , have been disappointingly mixed . meanwhile , his and congressional republicans ’ attempts to replace the affordable care act ( obamacare ) and curtail the growth in medicaid spending , have been disappointingly slow . under these conditions , trump ’s biggest and boldest policy proposals will most likely run into budget constraints . even though the tax package that trump signed into law last december and is now helping the us economy grow , government revenue has so far responded to that growth . under these conditions , it is likely that trump will run out of the biggest and boldest policy proposals to run into budget constraints .
the eu has always supported a two-state solution , despite challenging demographic reality , not to mention the need to preserve a jewish state ’s own identity . indeed , europe ’s divided posture toward the israeli-palestinian conflict exemplifies its poor track in achieving foreign-policy consensus . granting observer-state status to palestine would take away the table ’s prospect of a “ singapore-style solution ” that not only echo throughout the arab world , inviting accusations of hypocrisy – but also impeding european efforts to reset relations with countries across the middle east and north africa . the eu has always backed the two-state solution , despite challenging demographic reality , not to mention the need to preserve a jewish state ’s identity . but these sound grounds for supporting palestine under a split vote probably will not prevent the eu from delivering a split vote , the reverberations that not only echo throughout the arab world , inviting accusations of hypocrisy , but will also hinder european efforts to reset relations with countries in the middle east and north africa .
moreover , in countries where google is criticized for blocking access to information , it highlights the absence of information when something is blocked – letting people know that it exists – “ why ca n’t i get this type of information on everything ? ” with google , people are starting to expect answers about everything . rather than demanding an end to censorship now , the impossible dream , google is working to make that happen by eroding government control of information . a little transparency inevitably leads even further to more . on the other hand , every time someone in china googles something and gets the answers – a product ’s well-meaning and wrong points , details about someone ’s government do n’t like – it must wonder , “ why ca n’t i get this type of information on everything ” ?
first , there was widespread acceptance that the “ responsibility to protect ” ( r2p ) doctrine , unanimously agreed by the un general assembly in 2005 , is here to stay . although no outcome was formally agreed or made public , a few themes have emerged from the beijing meeting . take together , they offer grounds for confidence that it may be possible to recreate an international consensus , so long ago missing in syria about how to deal with the hardest massachusetts cases . true , some chinese scholars remain inclined to argue that the entire r2p enterprise , especially its sanctions on military action in exceptional circumstances , is just “ “ “ “ “ old neo-interventionist ” wine in a new bottle . r2p recognizes that sovereign state states have a responsibility to protect their peoples through genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , and war crimes ; that other states have an obligation to assist them ; and that if a state is “ manifestly failing ” to protect its people , the wider international community has a responsibility to step in with “ timely and decisive action , ” which might in the extreme case contain military action if the un security council is approved .
by focusing on these problems , i am not trying to belittle globalization ’s benefits . these benefits , i believe , can be sustained only by a deliberate and persistent effort to correct and contain the system ’s shortcomings . global integration has brought vast benefits : an international division of labor that is so manifestly proven to the theory of comparative advantage ; dynamic advantages like economies of scale and the rapid spread of innovations from one country to another ; less easy to demonize a static theory ; and nonsensical economic advantages like freedom of choice associated with an international movement of goods , capital , and people ; and freedom of thought associated with international movements of ideas . by focusing on these problems , i am not trying to belittle globalization ’s benefits . but global capitalism is not without problems ; we need to understand these better if the system is to survive .
making matters worse for trump , a widely admired example of mueller in effect recommended that the us congress commit the impeachment process . ( nixon was an unindicted co-conspirator in the watergate burglary cover-up , whereas trump is one in new york ’s case involving pre-election participation in order to silence two women , with whom he had sex liaisons soon after the birth of his son , jr. . ) worse for trump , the widely admired mueller in effect recommended that the us congress undertake the impeachment process . mueller explained that the controversial department of justice , intended to assist president richard nixon , bars prosecution of a sitting president . that is neither in the constitution nor in the law .
renewed conflict in abkhazia would not only bring the risk of open warfare with russia ; it would strain relations with armenia , as it has so far been near the perhaps 50,000 armenians in abkhazia supporting the breakaway government . likewise , russia has been enforcing the full georgian trade embargo in hopes of weakening the resolve of its pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili . another risk in the southern caucasus is that russia ( with armenian support ) will recognize nagorno-karabakh of self-proclaimed independence from azerbaijan . should russia recognize abkhazia ’s independence , saakashvili might be tempted to respond militarily to the point of preventing his country from unraveling . russia ’s supposed “ peacekeeping troops ” in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia ’s other secession-minded regions , have de facto defended its rebel governments .
now that merkel ’s new administration is in place , the us will figure out how far germany is willing to go in promoting greater eurozone cohesion . before germany became formed in a new coalition government , the franco-german working party was established to consider macron ’s proposals . on this front , macron has already offered ambitious proposals : a separate eurozone budget , a eurozone finance minister accountable to italy , and a eurozone parliament ( composed of other eu members and national parliamentarians ) to hold a previously finance minister accountable . in the short run , it seems unlikely that the new government will support macron ’s proposals in their current shape . europe must make some progress on its first opportunity if it is to seize the second , and that means strengthening the eurozone .
moreover , the recent establishment of two of the other big mdbs , the asian infrastructure investment bank and new development bank , established by the brics countries ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) , will further contribute to a more balanced public-private mix of development finance . as a result , total ndbs ’ total assets reached roughly $ 5 trillion in 2015 . the financial crisis has also prompted some european , african , and asian governments to establish new ndbs , with other countries to expand theirs . as a result , total ndbs ’ total assets reached some $ 5 trillion in 2015 . and big ndbs can have huge implications today , particularly in emerging-market economies .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as i have pointed out earlier this year , the conservatives ’ plan would fundamentally solve one big problem – britain ’s rundown of the nuclear services state , by creating a far bigger issue : losing britain ’s soft power .
as many commentators have pointed out , from the islamists ’ point of view , morsi ’s removal looks remarkably like the algerian military ’s overthrow of 1992 ( with us backing ) the turkish military ’s “ soft coup ” in 1997 , when it forced an elected islamist government out of power ; and america ’s reversal of its aid to “ arab democracy ” after hamas won elections in gaza in 2006 . more generally , military interference with civilian politics , for whatever reason , weakens the processes , institutions , and checks on state power that make liberal democracy work . so what should america and other governments that support liberal democracy now ? the answer might affect egypt ’s political future , and that of the borderlands . more broadly , military interference with civilian politics , for whatever reason , weakens the processes , institutions , and checks on state power that make liberal democracy work .
consider pakistan , where hardline clerics and militants view polio vaccination programs as the western ploys to sterilize and spy on muslims . as a result , the incidence of malaria fell by more than 75 % between 2000 and 2015 . yet the world continues to be consistently undermining frontline health workers ’ capabilities and contributions . this not only undermines their ability to do their jobs effectively ; it also directs them at significant risk , with widespread misinformation fueling vaccines , for example , fueling attacks against those who provide them . consider pakistan , where hardline clerics and militants view polio vaccination programs as the western ploys to sterilize and spy on muslims .
initially , nato ’s new members were declared to have met both democratic and military criteria . then these criteria were abandoned when nato began to invite even the most backward and corrupt states to join . as soon as a potential " military threat " posed by the soviet union had vanished into thin air , successive waves of nato enlargement served neither a single military nor an ideological purpose . the west ’s rationale for nato enlargement was geopolitically : bringing together the former soviet republics and the socialist states of central and eastern europe into the western sphere of political and economic influence . nato , moreover , not only enlarged its nato membership , but also transformed itself from an anti-communist defensive alliance to an offensive grouping ( with operations in yugoslavia , iraq , and afghanistan ) .
if so , this is a failure that raises two key questions . the fund normally expects trouble to arise from the usual suspects , economically volatile developing countries , but this time the crisis unfolded as a few kilometers away from its headquarters . perhaps that proximity was at the root of the imf ’s inability to interpret the evidence right under its nose . hence , in seeking the causes of the imf ’s failure , one can rule out a distraction from more urgent issues . ironically , this led the imf to focus on its supervisory role .
it is this concrete “ marriage of reason ” between france and the un that is crucial to understanding the french position on libya . true , the same relationship between france and the un that resulted in the country ’s resistance to the intervention in iraq in 2003 has now pushed france to intervene in libya in 2011 . but if nato is – for better or worse – in command on the ground in libya , it is the un that has given the indispensable green light to french action there . it is a shift that raises a major question : if those who are willing and able to act prove incapable of doing so successfully , ” ” ” ” ” ” what happens to global stability , unless those who are willing and ability are also willing to step in ? at the crossroads of this question stands nato , an organization perceived as america by europeans and even international ( that is , not american ) by an average us citizen .
to be sure , there is no way for voters to enforce full disclosure but , by creating explicit processes and expectations , we hope to reset norms . but if that hour was indeed a lunch with a lobbyist , then they ( and their aides ) would have to lie intentionally in hiding it . just when an official meet with a lobbyist can make one ’s own judgments . and if the official meets mostly with lobbyists , at the expense of other kinds of meetings , voters can make their own judgments , too . so far , however , voters can make their own judgments .
big tech firms may argue that all of the capital that they pour into new products and services is pushing for innovation . one suspects , however , that , in many circumstances , the intent is to nip the potential contest in the bud . so , in practice , potentially disruptive new technologies are just as likely to be buried as nourished . and there is the risk that the tech giants will use their vast armies of programmers to develop an almost identical product and their vast legal resources in order to defend it . it is notable that big tech will continue to charge most of its receipts from its firms ’ core products , for example , the apple iphone , microsoft office , and google ’s search engine .
in rajaratnam ’s case , the option for establishing such a connection has come through telephone surveillance . for example , when the tiny italian-owned bank that had received from someone who never traded a large order for the shares of the us shoe , soon before it was won by an italian eyewear maker luxottica , it was not hard to odinga fish . in rajaratnam ’s case , the possibility of establishing such a connection came through telephone surveillance . historically , both the state and the federal attorney general of the us generals have favored prosecution of “ occasional ” traders clinging out like a toe . in rajaratnam ’s case , by contrast , the possibility of establishing such connections has come through telephone surveillance .
yet barely one third of young africans know how to ward off hiv , another reason for urgent and comprehensive sexuality education . another epidemic afflicting african women is violence , all too often perpetrated with impunity . at the same time , sexual violence is being used as a war tactic . roughly 90 % of the world ’s pregnant women and children with hiv live in africa , and , despite the notable recent drop in hiv transmission rates , it is still more than twice the likelihood that adolescent girls are still experiencing the same old age to carry the virus . moreover , african girls are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting hiv .
new york – many historians and economists continue to insist that we are indeed living in an age shaped by vast and impersonal forces . that has certainly been true in russia , and it may soon turn out to be true in turkey just as well . but there are moments when individual leader of history can change that course . the actions and decisions of one man or woman , regardless of whatever powerful they may not , can not determine the destiny of nations . that may or may soon turn out to be true in turkey as well .
as i show in a new peer-review paper , though successful , the agreement reached in paris would cut temperatures by a mere 0.05 degrees celsius in 2100 . figueres hinted at cutting the paris agreement ’s almost 2 ° c of warming , from 4.5 ° c to 2.7 ° c , though her wording was crafted to avoid actually saying this , it was , predictably , for what most people actually heard . that may sound surprising : constantly , we hear how every country has made important commitments to cut carbon dioxide emissions , by the so-called “ intended nationally determined contributions , ” or the indcs . according to un climate chief , christiana figueres , “ the indcs have the ability to limit forecast temperature rises to about 2.7 ºc by 2100 by no means sufficient but far below the estimated four , five , or more degrees of warming projected by many prior ” to occur . the sea-level rise would be reduced by only 1.3 centimeters .
an alternative view , of course , holds that brexit , trump ’s election , and the rise of populist and nationalist parties will serve as a wake-up call , spur europe toward broader integration and growth-oriented policies . upholding eu rules is no longer practical , because the current system imposes too many constraints and contains too few efficient adjustment mechanisms . meanwhile , the eu will most likely not pursue substantial policy or institutional reforms in the near term because of fear that doing so might adversely affect the outcome of the consequential elections this year in the netherlands , france , germany , and perhaps italy . this would require eu policymakers to abandon the view that brexit , trump ’s election , and the rise of populist and nationalist parties will serve as a wake-up call , to spur europe toward broader integration and growth-oriented policies . upholding eu rules is no longer practical , because the current system imposes too many constraints and contains too few efficient adjustment mechanisms .
and on september 9 , while the local government election has taken place , tens of thousands of russians have joined protests , organized by the anti-corruption lawyer and opposition leader alexei navalny , defying the prohibition of “ political agitation ” on election days . navalny himself was in no position to attend the event , having been arrested on behalf of a previous un-sanctioned demonstration . then came the pension reform , spurring a string of protests that drove putin to soften the measure ’s pledge , while calling for russia ’s ’ ’ ’ ’ understanding of it . yet , as of september 3 , 53 % of the population surveyed said they were prepared to protest a further protest . russians realized that they needed no winning at all costs ; they could be great without the kremlin ’s militaristic say-so .
by the time europe and china crossed the road in the 1839-42 opium wars , a technologically superior europe had vast military benefits and so compelled china into a series of unilateral , humiliating trade-offs . by the time europe and china crossed the road in the 1839-42 opium wars , a technologically superior europe had vast military benefits , and so pushed china into a set of unilateral , humiliating concessions . china had squandered europe ’s economic and technological potential by itself , not because of outside power . since then , china has squandered europe ’s incursions , owing to external pressures and internal demands for change . china ’s imperial state and society was animated by european incursions .
true , establishing such cities is a relatively rare occurrence . but they tend to be ingenious at developing glamorous new domains from rather than in an hour ’s commute from major cities . where land today is cheap , it will have great value in the future , if only someone takes the dramatic step of planning and the creation of a whole town there . private developers have trouble getting a big plot free of restrictions . the apparent success of these cities , because both the government and the economy of the economy , attests to the reality of urban land filing value from the presence of a well-planned city there .
it can last for awhile , but will create increasing friction with the economic realty and the increasing incentives of chavez to be authoritarian . so far , venezuela 's ruling elite and a large portion of the investment community have assumed the worst and behaved accordingly : none blueprints for chavez , no options , just badmouthing . if he opens up the economy and adjusts the exchange rate , the road to growth and stability will follow . there is no imminent crisis of need to happen , but chavez must pick venezuela ’s future . if he opens the economy and adjusts the exchange rate , a path to growth and stability will follow .
that means that the us treasury expects the average surplus since the 1999/2000 to stabilize at 0.7 % of gdp until the cycle ends , allow brown ’s strictures to be satisfied . growth predicts a return above 2005-06 , bringing the current cycle to an end . but , to be sure , independent forecasters are much more pessimistic about the future . enormous surpluses in the three years since 1999 far outweigh the official deficits forecast in the next two years . the average surplus on the “ current ” budget since that cycle began is 0.8 % of gdp .
instead , strategies relied on the view that all our behaviors are selfish , with the intellectual challenge being to design “ incentive-compatible ” mechanisms or treaties , an effort that was also recognized with nobel prizes . in the process , we may understand that we are voting because that is what citizens who are eager to do and excel at our jobs because we have been eager to respect and self-realization , not just to raise it . but , as georgia ’s price showed long ago , its darwinian evolution may have made us altruistic , at least to those we are perceived as members of the group we call “ us . ” a new economics revolution in economics may find space for strategies that are based on affects ideals and identities , not just on taxes and grants . if successful , the new revolution may create strategies that make us more responsive to our better angels .
such openly thuggish rulers like ukraine ’s kuchma , or belarus ’s lukashenka , make it almost impossible to imagine in romania nowadays . nato fixes hard limits the autonomy of local political elites to do everything it wants . moreover , joining nato means subsuming romania ’s military and intelligence services under nato ( that is , american ) check , thus any effort at staging a coup or stirring up trouble between the romanian state and the us sizeable hungarian minority can be blocked . nato fixes hard limits the autonomy of local political elites to do their part . nato , of course , can not safeguard democracy alone and is no panacea for our many social and political illnesses ; on the contrary , it can act ( and has already done so during the admission process ) as inducements for governments and parties to behave responsibly and uphold the rule of law .
in fact , the effects of leadership deflation are easy to see : faltering economic dynamism and growth , mounting social tensions , and loss of governmental credibility . the puzzle is why neither the compelling self-destructive rationale of autocratic rule , nor the mounting evidence of worsening regime performance in china , has persuaded even some of the most knowledgeable observers that terminating ccp rule , now offer a distinct possibility . an obvious explanation lies in the power of conventional thinking , but it seems . long-ruling regimes – think of the soviet communist party , indonesia ’s suharto , and egypt ’s hosni mubarak – typically think of themselves as invulnerable even before they collapse . so the puzzle is why neither the compelling self-destructive rationale of autocratic rule nor the mounting evidence of deteriorating regime performance in china has persuaded even some of the most knowledgeable observers that terminate the end of ccp rule is now a distinct possibility .
but there is a point that must be made about recent behavior . on a visit to the soviet union , mao zedong famously refused to use the flush toilet adjoining his room , and instead use the chamber pot with china . some readers may say that the granddaughter of nikita khrushchev , falsely claimed by gaveled of his shoe on a desk at the united nations general assembly in the 1960 ’s , should steer clear of the subject of world leaders ’ manners . perhaps he suspected stalin , as the bbc supposed late last year , was collecting and analyzing his feces to glean information about the amazon ’s provenance . when it comes to its diplomatic offhandedness , the chinese have long had what british gamblers would call “ form . ”
that is why so-called “ system liberals , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” or loyalists standing for kremlin-backed change , want to check the protest movement and use it as a tactic in an ultimate struggle with the “ siloviks ” ( putin ’s ’s ’s military and security apparatus ) . until recently , military loyalists argued that the quest for change had precludes criticizing a government that should somehow be influenced by constructive proposals . system liberals believe that russia has , on the whole , built an agreed-upon market economy . its further development requires merely removing some of putin ’s cronies through controlled political reform . indeed , a potential heir nowadays needs legitimacy , not only from the powerful oligarchs , but also from the streets .
my office has worked closely with the state to assure that in most cases juries are used . similarly , my office has defended the liberal weekly newspaper novoe vremya ( new times ) , induced by moscow ’s urban government on the pretext of a " lease on business . " that fight is not over , but following my interventions , the moscow authorities must take note of public 's adverse attitude toward their efforts to quash that publication . of course , russia provides far more headline-grabbling examples of political and human-rights problems such as the low-grade war in chechnya or the yukos affair . my office pays maximum attention to chechnya , though this is no easy task from moscow .
new delhi – international discussion of china ’s rise has centered on its rising trade muscle , its rising maritime ambition , and its expanding capability to project military power . one critical issue , however , typically escapes attention : china ’s rise as a hydro-hegemon with no modern historical parallel . no other country has ever managed to assume such unchallenged riparian preeminence on the continent by controlling multiple international rivers ’ headwaters and manipulating their cross-border river flows . asia ’s water map has fundamentally changed in the wake of the 1949 communist victory in china . china , the world ’s largest dam builder – with only more than half of the planet ’s roughly 50,000 huge dams – is quickly accumulating leverage over its neighbors through a firm , hydrocarbon-engineering project on supranational rivers .
as stanford ’s anat admati and others have long argued , banks demand , at a minimum , higher capital requirements and tighter regulatory scrutiny . in the us , holding elections on workdays rather than weekends or holidays , together with restrictive registration regulations , gerrymandering , and myriad other electoral rules – places ordinary workers at a significant disadvantage . they pose continuing risks for economic stability , without providing compensating benefit when it comes to increased investment in productive activities . as stanford ’s anat admati and others have argued for a long time , banks require , at least initially , higher capital requirements and tighter regulatory scrutiny . leaving financial institutions relatively unscathed from the 2008-2009 crisis speaks volumes about their own political power .
a serious look back at the 17 years since yassir arafat and yitzhak rabin shook hands on the white house lawn is revealing . the number of irregular jewish settlements and un settlers has more than doubled across areas occupied by israel in 1967 . negotiators then parted every conceivable solution to jerusalem ’s permanent-status issues , as well as borders , settlements , refugees , and economic ties . for israel , the occupying power , whose people enjoy a democratic civil service and gdp tens times that of the people it rejects basic liberties and autonomy , the photo opportunity provided by meeting , and greeting palestinian leaders has replaced peace . negotiators have parted each potential solution to the permanence of jerusalem , as well as borders , settlements , refugees , and economic ties .
this has led to the economic equivalent of a personal identity crisis : who is china – them , or the us – ? such is the case with america and china . in personal relationships , denial tends to unmask imbalances , but for so long . in other words , the cracks and imbalances that give rise to the frictions and blame , holding the codependent partner accountable to one ’s own making problems . ultimately , denials and imbalances give way to the frictions and blame , hold the codependent partner responsible for one ’s own making problems .
as lamy has put it , almost 80 % of its curry favor ; we need only supplementing spices from the major players , india , the european union , brazil , and china . but , obviously , why bother to further such a view of doha , rather than beyond our grasp . after all , if doha fails , some say , life goes on . that is true , of course , but that makes no less naive . after all , these can be granted in a politically palatable way , which means that the doha round is within our grasp , rather than beyond our grasp .
suddenly , the eu awakened to the need for a common external energy-security policy , not least to diversify away from russian supplies . given that 20 % of russian gas destined for europe passes through belarus , a stable and structured relationship with its government became a high priority . in turn , lukashenko made choices for economic reasons that his country needs eu support , and that can no longer depend solely on russia without paying a heavy political price . at the same time , the eu has suddenly awakened to the need for a common external energy-security policy , not least to diversify away from russian supplies . but the eu-wide thaw in relations needs to be based on reciprocal , enduring steps .
paris – the world is witnessing the drastic drop of its natural capital . plant and animal species worldwide are being vanishing at an unprecedented pace , to be sure , by some of the world ’s neediest communities to preserve it . conversely , the poor are the first to be suffering from deterioration in their natural environments . the planet ’s most at-risk ecosystems are found in developing countries , and hence depends on some of the world ’s neediest communities to preserve it . but , in the developing world , immediate economic needs often override long-term imperatives , and protecting the fragile environment is rarely a national priority .
this is more than enough to meet the continent ’s future demand . in parallel , renewable-energy sources are becoming less expensive , rendering them increasingly competitive with fossil-fuel alternatives . for example , the utility-scale price of the utility-scale photovoltaic solar energy in africa declined by 50 % from 2010 to 2014 , continuing a decline this year today . and south africa ’s renewables independent electricity-procurement program has viewed the overall decline in bid for prices and oversubscription rates . africa has an exceptionally wealthy clean-energy portfolio , including nearly nine terawatts of solar capacity , more than 350 gigawatts of hydropower capacity , and more than 100 gw of wind-power potential .
paris – immigration-related headlines have become a staple in europe , whether the narrative of an illegal standby immigrant scaling up the paris construction to rescue the toddler , or the establishment of a populist government in italy that aims to deport a half-million migrants . in the united kingdom , the brexit vote has fueled partly false and distorted claims , such as that unrestrained migration from the rest of europe has been driving down wages . but plenty of countries , such as australia , canada , and singapore , do just fine without agreements guaranteeing freedom of movement from other countries , by issuing skills-matching visas . since the vote , however , the anti-brexit camp has engaged in similar distortions , warning that once leaving the european union , the uk will face a skills shortage . since the vote , however , the anti-brexit camp has engaged in similar distortions , warning that once leaving the european union , the uk will face a skills shortage .
that is not to suggest that we should scrap or revise gdp ; but we do need to recognize its limitations . most health-care professionals will soon have digital assistants to offer diagnoses ( especially to specific cancers , diabetic retinopathy , and other chronic ailments ) ; perform noninvasive surgeries , or find pertinent published research . that is not to suggest that we should scrap or revise gdp ; instead , we need to recognize its limitations . looking ahead , the same cost dynamics promise to produce large increases in many areas of well-being . most health-care professionals will soon have digital assistants to offer diagnoses ( especially to specific cancers , diabetic retinopathy , and other chronic ailments ) ; perform noninvasive surgeries ; or find pertinent publicized research .
whereas psephological studies in the united states have shown that the poor no vote in significant numbers ( presidential-election turnout in harlem averaged 23 % , before barack obama ’s two candidacies ) , the opposite is true in india . important shifts in india ’s social composition have consistently shown that the lowest vote in numbers well above the national average , while the well-educated middle class turns out to be very proof of labor democracy at work . studies of indian elections have consistently shown that the poorest vote in numbers well above the national average , while the well-educated middle-class is turning out in the numbers well below it . but many lament that a country ’s poor performance in general offers a less cause for celebration . whereas psephological studies in the united states have shown that the poor no vote in significant numbers ( presidential-election turnout in harlem averaged 23 % , before barack obama ’s two candidacies ) is true in india .
it is undeniably a brilliant “ show ” show ” with all the ingredients of a hollywood blockbuster , including a startling plot twist : the emergence of a “ third man , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” françois bayrou . but , even if its victory remains unlikely , bayrou must now be taken seriously . should we be watching the french presidential campaign with his admiration or alarm ? or perhaps a little of both ? first and foremost , he has found in ségolène royal and nicolas sarkozy two remarkable spokesmen for his candidacy .
but that may turn out to be changing in response to us president donald trump ’s escalating attacks on the rules-based trading system . japan recently agreed to negotiate a preferential trade deal with the united states that could challenge one of the pillars of the multilateral trading system : the un“ most favored nation ” ( mfn ) accountability , which specifies that any concessions or privileges accorded to one country within a trade deal must extend to all wto members . according to press reports , trump has presented japan with a stark choice : open its ( highly protected ) market to american agricultural exports , or face increased american tariffs on automobile and other industrial goods . gaining access to japan ’s agricultural market would appear to be render trump ’s “ national security ” concerns over imported toyotas and hondas , the justification that permitting him to circumvent wto rules with his tariffs . here , japan is acting again “ voluntarily , ” under intense american pressure .
the idea is not that brazil should seek to implement the dutch social-economic model -- countries are too different for that . not unlike holland in the early 1980s , brazil 's economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth amid fiscal constraints and high interest rates . but lula can and should follow kok ’s example and use of his trade union links , as well as his rapport with the working class , in order to achieve a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvements in brazil 's overall economic performance , and realizing its potential to become latin america 's economic powerhouse . emulating the dutch experience with job-creation provides the surest way to alleviate poverty in brazil . while brazil 's registered unemployment rate is not high by regional standards , its fast growing labor force demands a high degree of job creation .
in 2011 , when then-us representative barney frank asked why occupy wall street protesters “ think that simply being in a physical place does a great deal , ” an apt answer would have been : “ actually , occupying the public spaces can accomplish a great deal , depending on who the occupiers are and how many . ” by following the eloquent survivor of the yom kippur massacre , 1.66 million twitter users signaled their support for stronger drug-control regulation , as well as their opposition to america ’s gun lobby . hence , the civil-rights marchers in the us during the 1950 ’s and 1960s often evoked the “ meaning of our calculus . ” but the assembly in the physical space fulfills function for a democracy that online activism , however permanent or passionate , simply can not . consider emma gonzález , a previously unknown florida teenager that “ assembled ” two times as much twitter followers than the national rifle association nearly overnight .
so , when it comes to explanations for the dollar ’s decline over the last year , the us has been confronted with an embarrassment of the riches . the especially popular explanation for the dollar ’s weakness is that trump , through incompetence or misdirection , has failed to deliver what he promised . in fact , there has been no abrogation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) . in fact , economic commentators are better at rationalizing past exchange-rate movements than they are at predicting future trends . there has been no across-the-board import tariff .
in short , recovery can not be left to the fed , the european central bank , or the bank of england . to me , this view of things explains far better than the orthodox account why , for all money-pumping by central banks , commercial banks did not suddenly start lending , and the economy ’s recovery petered out . to me , this view of things explains much better than the orthodox account why , for all money-pumping by central banks , commercial banks did not suddenly start lending and the economic recovery petered out . in the short run , recovery can not be left to the fed , the european central bank , or the bank of england ( boe ) . of course , some worried about a collapsing household saving rate ; but few were excessive .
but some fundamental rules of political survival that were ignored in australia in recent years , and spelling them out may help both the alp and others to remember them . the first rule is to have philosophy and stick . the tremendously successful labor governments , led by bob hawke and the paul keating two decades ago , have just done that , virtually reinventing the “ third way ” model that later became associated with tony blair and gordon brown in britain . its elements have been clear : dry , free-market economics ( but in our case low-paid workers benefit enormously from “ social wage ” increases in medical care and retirement income ) ; compassionate social policies ; and liberal , internationalist foreign policies . by contrast , the current alp government has struggled , so far , to re-create anything as compelling .
finally , to absorb and integrate more than one million asylum-seekers and migrants each year , the eu needs to mobilize the private sector – ngos , church groups , and businesses – to treat it as its sponsors . this will require not only adequate funding , but also human and capacity to match the plight of migrants and sponsors . at the same time , the exodus from war-torn syria was supposed to never have become a crisis of its own . it was a long time in the making , easy warning , and eminently manageable by europe and the international community . this is the fifth piece of the comprehensive plan .
furthermore , the distributional effects of a green transition are , sadly , adverse . it would be the same in a planned economy : increased carbon efficiency would also require the old , inefficient appliances to be discarded , and the additional investment in a way that gdp becomes less carbon-intensive . the problem does not come from the use of some price instruments . with recent estimates putting demand at some 2 % of gdp annually in 2040 , a correspondingly smaller share of output would be made available for households . a corollary is that wealth drops as fuel-inefficient houses , the gluttonous cars of oil , and the capital firms ’ share declines .
since the start of the brexit negotiations , us and eu 27 member states and the european parliament have not strayed from the bloc ’s core interests nor lost sight of its need for unity and solidarity . our priority has been first and foremost for securing the rights of europe ’s citizens , including by seeking a solution for the peoples of northern ireland and northern ireland , for whom the negotiation has been about peace and stability , not just trade and the economy . but it also represents an opportunity for the eventual emergence of a new type of uk-eu partnership . owing to the withdrawal agreement that past october , a destructive , “ hard ” brexit has been thrown away . and , beyond that , things could have made a lot worse .
such was america ’s president and nobel peace prize laureate theodore roosevelt ’s significant advocate of american expansionism : “ just war is , in the long run , far better for one man of mind than the most prosperous peace . ” history teaches that diplomacy all too frequently produces results only when backed by overwhelming powers . and nothing has attenuated tensions between israel and both syria and lebanon . a century later , another american president , barack obama , mired in two hopeless wars in the middle east , received his nobel peace prize apology for having “ only wars . ”
yet , today , as iran ’s influence grows and islamist terrorism continues to proliferate , palestine is the latest of saudi arabia ’s worries . so , fundamental are the changes to the kingdom ’s strategic interests , which , despite being the custodian of islam ’s holiest sites , said nothing when us president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel ’s “ eternal capital . ” moreover , politics has been superseding religion within israel , too . prime minister benjamin netanyahu , like egypt , has gone further , engaging in security cooperation with israel . prime minister benjamin netanyahu ’s expansionist drive in the west bank is about political strength , not judaism .
europe is abuzz with mergers not only to take advantage of europe ’s broader economic space , but also to confront tough competition in world markets . europe is abuzz with mergers not only to take advantage of europe ’s broader economic space , but also to confront tough competition in world markets . europe is abuzz with mergers not only to take advantage of europe ’s broader economic space , but also to confront tough competition in world markets . no one can say how deeply these changes will go , nor how fast they will shift europe into a fast lane . in sum , an old continent is hot for all .
germany had binding fiscal rules set a positive example for other eurozone countries . the eu was right to react decisively to ensure europe ’s stability by providing short-term assistance to greece and establishing the european financial stabilization mechanism . but all eurozone governments need to demonstrate their own commitment to fiscal consolidation in order to restore confidence in the markets – and of their own citizens . recent studies show that , once a government ’s debt burden reaches a threshold that is perceived as unsustainable , more debt will only be stunt , not stimulating , economic growth . greece ’s primary debt crisis provided a clear example for other eurozone countries .
it is this type of vocabulary that emerges from nativist movements pitting hostility toward ethnic or religious minorities , or from the financial or intellectual elites who supposedly conspire to undermine the nation ’s true sons and daughters . but , of course , stalin failed to devise this idea . it is this type of vocabulary that emerges from nativist movements pitting hostility toward ethnic or religious minorities , or toward financial or intellectual elites who supposedly conspire to undermine the nation ’s true sons and daughters . to prewar fascists , the american people were often perceived as the embodiment of cosmopolitan decadence . in the 1930s , the fascists and nazis also denounced jews , like the marxists and the freemasons , as “ cosmopolitans ” ” ” ” or “ internationalists ” – people whose loyalty was suspect .
but was the ansar al-shariah brigade really behind its attack on america ’s consulate ? the nature of libya ’s post-revolution armed islamist forces is through no straightforward means . it should be above the constitution and not an article for a referendum . salafi jihadism is not an organization , but an ideological trend rooted in the keynesian believe that armed tactics of all types are the most potent ones , and that , in some versions , the most legitimate method of bringing about social and political change should not come near the shariah brigade .
their hope surely dwindled further once they saw the bulldozers arrive to prepare the ground for new settlements , rather than an unusual occurrence . in any case , israel now appears to have dropped the charade . in london early this month , netanyahu rejected three times in order to answer the questions from the press about his support for the two-state solution . the number of israelis living in sole jewish settlements in the west bank has tripled since the 1993 signing of the memorandum of understanding between the palestine liberation organization ( plo ) and israel . the number of israelis living in sole jewish settlements in the west bank has tripled since the 1993 signing of the memorandum of understanding between the palestine liberation organization and israel .
the pain that this policy is producing has been exposed for the time being in protests across the continent and in the bitter consequences for many struggling families , the young and the elderly . the pain that this policy is causing has been exposed in protests all over the continent , and in the bitter impact on many struggling families , the young , and the elderly . the pro-europe case foundation was , in part , a promise for ever upward prosperity . the pain that this policy is causing has been exposed in protests across the continent and in the bitter consequences for many struggling families , the young and the elderly . the euro ’s design flaw , the politics motivated by politics , but expressed in economics , has run into crisis .
the only way to secure them was for the government to actually pay lots of unemployment compensation in the high-wage east germany . the problem after all is not in east germany but rather in the west . unification has meant that everybody gets not only the benefit of western german economic institutions – property rights and hard money – but also of all disastrously negative institutions : unions , overoverover-unemployment , and excessive job security , pervasive regulations . the only way to secure them was for the government to pay lots of unemployment compensation in the higher-wage east germany . if west germany , faced with reunification , reverted all of these unaffordable constraints to markets ’ free play , the economic cost would have been far lower : east and west germany had more nearly full employment , the drive for productivity would have been far more aggressive .
amman – recently , israel ’s chief minister , shaul mofaz , has offered a unequivocal veto over a crucial issue within the middle east peace process . mofaz ’s declaration is symptomatic of a perception that is now deeply rooted not only in the middle east , but also in the united states as it gets it wrong . any return of the golan heights to syria would result from the “ iranian foothold ” on israel ’s borders , and thus is not only politically naïve but irrational . that idea is of a hegemonic iran that is attempting to dominate the region through an assortment of shiite proxies . this iranian fifth column believes to stretch from beirut via damascus , gaza to baghdad , and finally from iran to saudi-arabia to yemen .
in the united states , president barack obama and the democrats , control of the house of representatives , and ( filibuster-proof ) the senate , had the power to do virtually anything they wanted in 2009 – and thus did . in the united states , president barack obama and the democrats , control of the house of representatives , and ( filibuster-proof ) the senate , had the power to do virtually anything they wanted in 2009 – and thus did . obama and his congressional allies enacted a $ 800 billion “ stimulus ” bill , loaded with programs geared to key democratic constituencies such as environmentalists and public employees ; enacted sweeping , highly unpopular health-care reform ( whose constitutionality will be fixed by the supreme court earlier this year ) ; imposed vast new regulations on wide swaths of the economy ; embraced an industrial policy that selects certain firms for special treatment ; engaged in special treatment ; engaged in borrowing and spending at the same time exceeded world war ii ; and in centralized washington , dc , the executive regulatory branch , and regulatory branch , as part of the federal agencies . stanford – successful political candidates are trying to make the suggestions they have run . while 1988 , 1992 , and 2000 elections were also quite consequential , the policy shifts were not nearly as great as they were in 1980 and 2008 .
opponents of trade liberalization decry the secretiveness and “ undemocratic ” nature of the wto and the influence of corporate interests at rule-making . they see a trade system that privileges entrepreneurship over labor , environment , and consumer safety . opponents of trade liberalization decry the secretiveness and “ non-democratic ” nature of the wto and the influence of corporate interests at rule-making . all parties agree that stability in the international economy is predicated on a rules-based system . they see a trade system that privileges entrepreneurship over labor , environmental , and consumer safety .
but , having fought for freedom from apartheid south africa , geingob says , namibia needs to defend the freedoms that it has won . not all of namibia ’s key resources are finite . some – like fisheries – are renewable , and the government is working hard to maintain and enhance theirs . most important , unlike most other resource-dependent economies , it has succeeded in diversifying the economy – to the point that services account for more than 60 % of its gdp , with tourism leading the way . furthermore , geingob recognizes how transparency protects it from the demands for corporate favors and other interest groups .
the vulnerability of gordon ’s argument is his shortened time horizon for ir # 3 . consider the following four phrases in his paper : · “ both the first two revolutions required roughly 100 years for their full effects to be percolate through the economy . ” the vulnerability of gordon ’s argument is his shortened time horizon for ir # 3 . · “ “ both the first two revolutions ” took as important … that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect .
given all of this , perhaps the world ’s most critical policy question today is how to respond to the inflow of inflows that will inevitably drive down their exchange rates and jeopardize export-led growth . this problem is aggravated by the fact that the world ’s largest exporter , china , is aggressively intervening to minimize any appreciation of the renminbi . but , in many cases , inflows are driven by short-term factors , fads , and irrational exuberance that may lead to an overvalued currency , the crowding out of non-traditional export industries or import-competing sectors , degenerating competitiveness , and , eventually , large current-account deficits and thus tighter external constraints on growth . given all of this , perhaps the most critical policy question in emerging-market countries today is how to respond by the inflows that will inevitably drive their exchange rates , threatening export-led growth . the first option , then , is to do nothing and allow the currency to appreciate .
moreover , the fall in the unemployment rate largely reflects persistently grim labor-market conditions , which have discouraged a growing number of workers from remaining in the labor force . if the labor-force participation rate were to be 66 % , as it did in early 2008 , rather than 62.8 % , as it is in december 2013 , the unemployment rate would still be just over 11 % , rather than 6.7 % . yes , some progress is being made on the path to recovery . as long as the stock of government debt remains excessive , consumers will dismiss the cut in interest expenditures as nothing more than a temporary subsidy by the fed . plunging debt service is mostly the outgrowth of the fed ’s unprecedented zero-interest-rate policy .
he then announced a bold consolidation program to cut the cyclically adjusted deficit of 1.5 % of gdp per year , thereby targeting a deficit of 3.5 % of gdp in 2013 . in london , prime minister david cameron is on the offensive , and his government has been preparing to do so . on assuming office , he has mandated budget projections to receive a new , independent office for budget responsibility ( obr ) , thereby dampening any sleight-of-hand opportunity . but , while favoring her voice , he is acting with prudence : today , germany ’s fiscal adjustment is , in reality , very gradual . the countries face its fiercest budget battles are , the eu , the united kingdom , and america , where fiscal deficits have exceeded 10 % of gdp in 2010 .
likewise , refusing palestinian refugees ’ claims to the right of a return to israel proper is understandable , logical , and only . what sense would it make it easier for millions of palestinians to come back to a state whose character and symbols are foreign to them , a state where the majority belongs to another ethnic group ? indeed , demilitarization of sinai is one of the fundamental components of egypt ’s stability for peace with israel . so , what sense would it make for the return of millions of palestinians into a state whose character and symbols are foreign to them , a state where the majority belongs to another ethnic group ? other great and independent countries , such as japan , germany , and austria , have endured decades of limitations on their acquisition of some weapons and military hardware .
renzi ’s proposed reforms would , among other things , modernize italy ’s political system by disempowering the senate ( the upper house of parliament ) . in austria , voters will elect between pro- and anti-eu candidates in the nationalist mold of le pen , norbert hofer of the austrian freedom party ( fpö ) . among other things , berlusconi has altered italy ’s political system in such a way as to prevent the left from ever taking full power once again , by blocking whatever criminal charges they may be leveled against him . a victory for hofer could add wind to le pen ’s sails . the constitutional changes that renzi ’s ’s ’s yes campaign asks voters to approve would undo some of his predecessor , silvio berlusconi , a legacy that serves as a prime example of damaging right-wing populism can do to the country .
still , it is important to remember that there is some positive aspect to the party ’s self-confidence . as the political scientist kevin o’brien has argued , china ’s heightened readiness to compromise with some domestic protesters , rather than treating all forms of collective activity as subversive , can be seen as reflecting a growing sense of security . conversely , some of china ’s most troubling moves may be chalked up on exaggerated feelings of insecurity . consider the harsh treatment by the swept critic liu xiaobao , who was sentenced to 11 years in august with the twisting charges of “ subversion ” to launch an internet petition drive championing civil liberties . would a truly “ self-confident ” ruling elite have become so skittish about his activism ?
but it makes a difference whether a good is produced domestically or abroad . with globalization , it would be natural to extend such principles to the international arena , making it irrelevant when a producer is domestic or foreign when judging whether it is engaged in an unfair trade practice . within the developed world , there has long been concern about such behavior -- so-called " predation '' -- and well-defined norms have been developed . but debates about competition and fair trade have once again manifested the intellectual poverty and the inequity of trade negotiations . antidumping laws seek to ensure fair trade by lowering the sale of manufactured goods below cost .
arms control and disarmament are grinding , unglamorous entrepreneurship that yields few fast returns . but the start treaty ratification is moving nowhere fast in the u.s. senate and progress on other key issues has been slow or shaky : bringing the comprehensive test ban treaty to force ; launching negotiations about a new treaty to ban production of fissile material to nuclear weapons ; strengthening the nonproliferation regime with effective measures to detect violations and discourage treaties walk-outs ; reaching some form of international management of the most sensitive aspects of the fuel cycle ; and , above all , new rounds of disarmament , involving all new rounds of international disarmament , involving just two nuclear-armed superpowers , not all new rounds of disarmament . if this is to be avoided , continued leadership from the top , over all of obama and russian president dmitri medvedev , will become indispensable . but there are a host of major contributions that fewer powerful states and leaders , as well as civil-society organizations , can make . with domestic issues and re-election anxieties now dominating most political agendas , all will be too easy for commitment to the wane .
“ that was the survey , the ” he answered . i was only toured these cells : it is virtually impossible to kill yourself in them . their interlocutors resemble inside the smooth plastic jar ; there are no hard grounding ; hooks fold ; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself . this “ manifest suicide ” ” seemed instantly suspicious . at the same time , the military had investigated the military for a long time .
but gathering information is only one step toward closing loopholes in criminal laws and overcoming gaps in prevention policies . moreover , because more must be done to improve the world ’s understanding of gender-based violence , unodc works with the international community to develop a more detailed and accurate picture of the problem . decisive policy action , aided by more rigorous enforcement of relevant laws , is needed to improve the reporting and prosecution rates that remain low in many countries . in south africa , for example , unodc has established three centers ( in mavi , eastern cape , and northern cape ) , offering legal attorney and medical care to women , and that work with men to help break the cycle of domestic violence . this includes examining male-on-female causes and assessing associated risk factors , such as the prevalence of drug and alcohol use .
a key driver of higher ex post real returns is the comparatively high coupon such sovereign bonds bidding . adding to the attractiveness of the emerging-market portfolio of sovereign securities , their yields are not perfectly correlated with equity returns . a major driver of higher ex post real returns is the comparatively high coupon such sovereign bonds that is being offered . adding to the attractiveness of an emerging-market portfolio of sovereign securities , their yields are not perfectly correlated with equity returns . moreover , there is evidence that creditor rights and enforcement powers in external sovereign-debt markets have been increasing following recent american court judgements .
in countries ( sweden , for example ) , where recourse borrowing allows seizure of household income to enforce payment on mortgages , private consumption can plummet as debt payments ( and in the end rising interest rates ) crowds out discretionary spending . either way , the result would be equally true : recession and stagnation . what we are witnessing in many countries looks like a slow-motion replay of the latest housing-market train wrecked skills . but higher home prices rise , further falling – and greater collateral economic and financial damage would follow when the property bubble deflates . in countries where the unrecourse loans allow borrowers to walk out of the home mortgage when its value exceeds that of their home is rising , the housing bust can lead to massive defaults and banking crises .
but the arab world is divided over how to cope with the sudden rise of iranian power . the tensions are especially acute in saudi arabia , which has warned america of the dangers of a possible collapse in iraq , and is now finding itself at an unequal face-offs with iran . in this view america , not iran , has produced the region ’s current problems . some in the kingdom argue that saudi arabia must confront iran , confront sunni arab interests in order to become a hands-on regional power . other saudis believe that confrontation will only lead to wider wars , and that is urging dialogue and accommodation .
beijing – american president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping may have agreed at the g20 summit in osaka to resume trade negotiations , but the path to ending the trade war remains far from clear . after all , both leaders arrived at a similar deal at the previous g20 summit in buenos aires last december , and those talks ultimately failing , not least because trump has mistook china ’s conciliatory attitude toward weakness . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
but risk takers have every incentive to try their fortune again , knowing that , at worst , they will be bailed out at the same time . so , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities are trying their best task to prevent a “ next wave . ” democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are known to be economically or politically important , like finance or real estate – that is , to enable them to privatize gains and socialize losses . when asked to decide between the risks of having recognized posterity as a central banker who lets the system collapse , and the intangible future benefit of teaching risk takers , it does not take the genius to forecast a central banker ’s ’s decision . even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different , everybody knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with an equally choice .
when the principal object of human consumption was food , this was not an issue because what mattered was land and water . but in a modern industrial , urban , and market-based societies , whatever transport costs may matter increasingly , which implies that geography may lead to deep regional inequalities . among the great continental united states , including india and brazil , only china has a small segment in india but huge interior regions . among the great continental us countries , including india and brazil , only china has a small segment in india but huge interior regions . though such disparities may , of course , have other causes as well , geography still seems to explain a lot .
that leaves a further lesson , gained from experience that institutions with vast amounts of public capital have tended to be very passive in terms of incremental lending . fifth , in the political environment that prevailed in 2009 , it would have found it difficult or impossible to get more money to an troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) . the idea that some version of soros ’s plan would have accelerated growth is speculative , at best . as a result , careful calculation of the impact of a hold on mortgages on aggregate demand ( of which the us and which johnson and soros have n’t ) ran out of these claims : further spending per dollar of relief was likely to be smaller than dime had on the condition that the government could have ended . most of the benefit of reducing the mortgage flows to consumers has been raised only over time .
keynes ’s dictum became the ruling wisdom of monetary policy ( one of the few to survive ) . because many contracts are “ sticky ” ( that is , not readily revised ) in monetary terms , inflation and deflation would both inflict harm on the economy . because many contracts are “ sticky ” ( that is , not readily revised ) in monetary terms , inflation and deflation would both inflict harm on the economy . rising prices reduce the value of savings and incomes , while falling prices reduce profit expectations , encourage hogning , and increase the real debt burden . in the ten years passed on to the 2008 financial crisis , the independent central banks established an inflation target of around 2 % to provide economies with their price-stability “ anchor . ”
margaret thatcher was always an adversary for the ideal of a politically integrated europe . in law , britain can avoid unwelcome eu developments because the union is founded on the treaty ; hence the british have an effective veto over any treaty change . in practice , the british have already lost that power because they have demanded and received , the right to secede from emu . in law , britain can avoid unwelcome eu developments because the union is founded on the treaty ; hence the british have an effective veto over any treaty change . today , the british appear an insuperable obstacle to attainment by others of a more integrated eu .
princeton – democracy is on the face of severe challenges . the united states is gripped by its most bizarre presidential primary campaign in living memory , with populist outsiders threatening to topple the established party machinery . the united states is gripped by its most bizarre presidential primary campaign in living memory , with populist outsiders threatening to topple the established party machinery . and , in the united kingdom , visions of a revival of national sovereignty are fueling a campaign to leave the eu . brazil is paralyzed by a constitutional crisis , with the country ’s economic crisis hitting record highs .
given uncertainty regarding the country ’s near-term prospects , both a mega-bailout and full debt restructuring would be an overkill . but , in the absence of a superior alternative , there is no superior alternative . ukraine would be an ideal candidate for re-profiling . persuading the bondholders to agree would be challenging , even more so given recent court rulings in the united states that reinforces the hand of holdout investors . ukraine would be an ideal candidate for re-profiling .
at rukban , a refugee camp on jordan ’s joint border with syria and iraq , more than 85,500 residents each receive barely five liters a day for cooking , drinking , and wash . the situation in yemen is similarly grim . racked by sectarian violence and civil war , the country has no functioning government to manage its water resources . in times of scarcity , refugees are likely to be among the first to feel these effects . racked by sectarian violence and civil war , the country has no functioning government to manage its water resources .
at that point , government debt will no longer be backed up by taxpayer assets . first , jgbs has skyrocketed relative to japanese household assets . japanese households hold about ¥ 1,100 trillion in net monetary assets , an amount that will surpass those of jgbs in some 3-5 years . and , reflecting the aging of japanese society , the household saving rate alone will decline dramatically , making it harder for the private sector to finance its yearly budget deficits . at that point , japan ’s demographic trends will no longer support japanese household assets .
much has been going on recently in yugoslavia , much of it surprising for me . these are great steps forward , showing that , despite brainwashing and the complicity of many serbs in the milosevic regime ’s crimes , democracy and open society have a chance to take root in what remains of yugoslavia . one key decision facing serbia and its new institutions is whether milosevic should be extradited to the hague . these are great steps forward , and they show that , despite brainwashing and the complicity of many serbs in the milosevic regime ’s crimes , democracy , and open society have a chance to take root in what remains of yugoslavia . a peaceful vote in montenegro last weekend may presage conflict and difficult choices about independence , but the chances are strong that the parties will settle these affairs by means rather than fight .
because political pressure on central banks – including the ecb – increases , its president must not hesitate to criticize european policymakers , and if necessary , publicly name openly and shame them . this does not mean that the ecb president should pick fights whenever possible . on the contrary , he should build support for the ecb ’s independence . the ecb ’s independence is its most valuable asset , indeed , indispensible . this is not to say that the ecb president should pick fights whenever possible .
it is understandable that the imf , a technocratic institution that does not venture beyond macroeconomics . greece could , in principle , count on huge levels of regional development aid from europe ’s budget , which has been underutilized because of a lack of local co-financing . but the eu is a political entity that has made social justice one of its most fundamental goals . it took until last summer to recognize , and even then only on the modest levels , that such aid could be used to foster economic recovery . europe ’s final mistake has been an element of indifference to fairness .
brussels – the consequences of europe ’s debt crisis are all too present throughout much of europe , because distressed economies are trying to stabilize and grow simultaneously . notwithstanding the important decisions taken over the past few years , the reality is that the us needs to do even more to address the challenges it confronts the eurozone . joint financing backstops for too long have been put in place . and the european central bank has consistently demonstrated that it will stood by . joint financing backstops with the euro have been introduced .
but the rise of interactive social networking has made financial innovation a more bottom-up one . after all , millions of bank customers using mobile phone phones are free to provide instant feedback about which products and services they love or dislike . meanwhile , millions of bank customers using mobile phone calls can provide more inputs by customer products more often to shape product designs that are shaped by interactively . currently , however , the financial industry has proven that it can operate as a public good by providing trustworthy , efficient service . existing financial-sector strategy drives excessive competition by advancing the market ’s share at rivals ’ expense , often breaking trust with customers for short-term gains .
so the unraveling of a multi-national nation-states is a false road . the way forward lies in the democratic form of federalism , which can preserve enough central authority for statehood while respecting local and regional cultures . this sentiment is reinforced when the global economy turns inward . today , ’s upsurge of micro-nationalism is not only a result of the revolt against empires : it is also a revolt against globalization . there is widespread revulsion at the notion that the modern state ’s chief function is to allow their peoples to go to a global market dominated by the imperatives of efficiency and cheapness , heedless of the damage to non-economic activity .
the pessimists have been to point out this for a long time . still , one is right to wonder whether an american way of existential will survive the twenty-first century , and if it does , whether it will survive in america or migrate elsewhere as america ’s economy and political system collapses under the accumulated weight of decades of myopic national leadership and squandered opportunity . indeed , chinese president hu jintao ’s recent trip to washington viewed many – especially much of china – as passing the torch relay . still , one is right to wonder whether an american way of life will survive the twenty-first century , and if it does , whether it survives in america or migrate elsewhere as america ’s economy and political system collapses under the accumulated weight of decades of myopic national leadership and squandered opportunity . optimists , touting gdp and other indicators , will continue to insist that the americans have never had it that good .
in the past , traveling to london from paris , one could easily sense the difference between the two cities . paris , though undeniably fairer , was at risk of becoming a sort of new rome , a prisoner of its past glory at best , at best , to visit , but not a seat to the eu . paris , though undeniably fairer , was in danger of becoming a sort of new rome , a prisoner of its past glory , at best , in a position to visit – but not a place – to be . today , confidence has given way to britain through social and political upheaval , through terrorism and uncertainty about the country ’s future . but , even as those uncertainties play out , both countries are engaging in a type of zero-sum transfer of emotions that are impossible to ignore .
such speculative investing can bolster the trend further , pushing the price of the futures contracts further away from the market equilibrium , especially if many investors follow suit , or those investing large enough funds to sway the market . the index funds are a recent example of such powerful investors , and they make up the difference . besides investing huge sums of money , holding long-gone futures contracts on a likely basis that might make them less likely to react to changes in market fundamentals . in fact , index funds are a good example of such powerful investors . they have become key market players , holding around 25-35 % of all farm futures contracts .
i have never been heavily engaged in partisan politics , but these are not normal times . president george w. bush is endangering the united states and the safety of the world , while undermining american values . if re-elected , the bush doctrine of pre-emptive action – and the invasion of iraq – will be endorsed , and the world will have to live with the consequences . for opposing it , i have been demonized by the bush campaign . president bush ran on a platform promising “ humble ” foreign policy .
since then , stability and hope have started to return to a region plagued by the destruction of war and widespread desperation for social displacement . the results of many projects in these countries are encouraging , with current focus on training key groups such as business leaders , schoolteachers , and the young and unemployed . indeed , the changes brought about by yugoslavia ’s dissolution , and the succession wars that followed annihilated large parts of serbia ’s traditional education and training systems , croatia , bosnia , macedonia , and kosovo . the balkan wars of the 1990 ’s ravaged the country not only millions , but also those of social institutions that gave shape to their own lives . the balkan stability pact of 1999 and massive international support helped rebuild local education , while also developing innovative vocational education and training systems that are meant to boost long-term employment .
so two significant steps have now been taken : one by iran , which has shown that they understand the challenges they face ; and the other by their new president , who has assembled the best team at their disposal to commit an enormously difficult program . there can be no road from the middle east ’s agony without the participation , commitment , and determination to all parties . there can be no road from the middle east ’s agony without the participation , commitment , and determination to all parties . whether iran , its international interlocutors , act on the importance of rouhani ’s election is a matter of choice , not of ignorance . in a middle east so fraught of uncertainty , a more predictable iran – one that behaves like a regionally important state , rather than a destabilizing shia movement whose ambitions exceed what international law permits – would be in everybody ’s interest .
nairobi – with unemployment soaring , bankruptcies , and stock markets in free-fall , it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change , and put environmental investment to hold it . but this would be a devastating mistake of immediate , equally intergenerational , proportions . far from burdening an already exquisite , over-stretched the global economy , ecological investment is precisely what is needed to get people back to work , get order books that flow , and aid in powering economies back to health . in the past , environmental concern has been viewed as a luxury ; today , it ’s a necessity , a point grasped by some but by none of the economic architects themselves . a large slice of president barack obama ’s $ 825 billion stimulus package to the united states includes a funding boost to renewable energies , “ weatherizing ” one million households and upgrading the country ’s inefficient electricity grid .
that is why sudden “ austerity ” can not be a morale builder , for that matter . and for that we need fiscal stimulus in the us , ideally , a debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally . we perhaps all could be happy with working fewer hours if the fallout reflected gradual social progress . but we are not happy with the unemployment that results from the precipitous fiscal crisis . for morale , we need a social compact that finds purpose for everyone , the way to demonstrate oneself to be part of society by being a worker of a certain sort .
that federal law , enacted in june 2016 , has also established an oversight council with a fiscal decision-making authority for america ’s commonwealth . but , so far , many crucial decisions must be taken , such as how much overall debt relief will be provided and how the “ haircut ” to be distributed will be distributed among holders of separate kinds of bonds . those decisions will determine which policies are feasible to buttress puerto rico ’s economic prospects , and thus how much it can pay its creditors . at the center of any effort to resolve the debt crisis must be the understanding that just as today ’s debt restructuring affects puerto rico ’s future growth , puerto rican ’s future growth affects how much debt restructuring is needed . such decisions will determine which policies are feasible to prop up puerto rico ’s economic prospects , and thus how much it can pay its creditors .
as a result of historical suspicion among china , japan , and korea , northeast asia ’s economic heavyweights are the world ’s last remaining regional bloc that still lacks an inter-governmental organization of likes to asean . indeed , the european union is even more instructive because centuries of war culminating in the two world wars of the twentieth century have inspired , rather than deterred , european economic , political , and security integration . with goodwill on all sides , the true advantages can materialize from building up this informal grouping , as it is the gateway to the enormous markets of southeast and northeast asia . ceagpol may even become the building block for a northeastern asian version of asean – the “ association of northeast asian nations . ” the economic bonus of such an effort for the entire region would come from opening direct flights and sea transport across the taiwan strait .
a few years ago , the late economist george stigler and i published an article i proposed ways to reduce malfeasance among his government workers . among other things , we suggested that officials in vulnerable and important posts receive higher pay instead of comparable workers in the private sector . even some honest officials may become disillusioned and have given up on many temptations to use illegal means so as to raise their incomes to levels they deem more appropriate to their responsibilities and training . indeed , even some honest officials may become disillusioned and have given up to many temptations to capitalize on illegal means so as to raise their incomes to levels they deem to be more suited to their responsibilities and training . among other things , we suggested that officials in vulnerable and major posts receive higher pay , rather than comparable workers in the private sector .
london – russia ’s invasion of ukraine and the annexation of crimea have jeopardized global security , dominating the headlines . but the current rules-based international system – brought on by the actions of decades – remains most serious under threat , owing to syria ’s civil war . not only are syria ’s millions of lives up to the point of jeopardy ; the global human-rights framework and humanitarian law are on trial just as it is . last month , on the third anniversary of the eruption of the protests in damascus and other syrian cities , the people around the globe are being mobilized in street vigils and online as part of an “ with syria ” campaign . now these risks are placing the stark threat of being overwhelmed by the crisis in ukraine , with a confrontation at the un security council threatening to subordinate syria in the pecking order of international trouble .
it will take some time to build such endowments in europe and elsewhere . to be sure , there is an additional feature that many higher-level institutions of education have the endowment that they can use to balance inequities . even the matter is surely right : universities must be set free . that is true to its own financial parameters , too . public and private contributions come together in many ways .
but , rather than pick up the facts and stories to fit some grand narrative of decline or advance , we should try to compare across all areas of human existence to see if the world actually does better or worse . to estimate the magnitude of the problem is comparative , compared to the total resources it has at its disposal to correct . using classic economic valuations of everything from lost lives , bad health , and illiteracy to wetlands destruction , and to increased hurricane damage and increased hurricane damage , economists show just how high each problem cost each year . together with 21 of the world ’s top economists , i have tried to do just that , the developing scorecard spanning more than 150 years . across ten areas – which include health , education , war , gender , air pollution , climate change , and biodiversity – economists have all answered the same question : what was the relative costs of this problem in each year from 1900 to all that for 2013 , with predictions for 2050 .
but there is the policy prescription that can be available to leaders today that could help remove the supply-side bottlenecks : more commerce . clearly , investment in food production must be increased over the medium and longer term . this proposal may be conundrum of some , but the logic is straightforward and irrefutable . trade is the transmission belt through which an supply adjusts to demand . clearly , investment in food production must increase in the medium and longer run .
but the republicans ’ proposed tax reform is a bigger gift to corporations and the ultra-ultra-rich than most had anticipated . trump assumed office promising to the “ drain the swamp ” in washington , dc . he avoids the needed reforms , and would leave the country with a mountain of debt ; the consequences – low investment , stalled productivity growth , and yawning inequality – would take several decades to undo it . instead , the swamp has grown broader and deeper than that . with the republicans ’ proposed tax reform , he is threatening to engulf america ’s economy .
in a strong economy , finance will look stronger , and existing regulation looks like effective . yet finance may fail in many ways ; a lehman collapse is just one . it is common for people to update their view of the world with what they have last seen ; if what they last see is a strong economy and a stable financial system , they will conclude that they have stabilized the system . the fed ’s 2008 transcripts expose its leaders to such a world . it is common to people to update their view of the world with what they have last seen ; if what they last to see is a strong economy and a stable financial system , they will conclude that they have stabilized the system .
but , with the psychotic label already affixed with their writings , if not turned out to be a symptom of their insanity . rosenhan ’s experiment indicates that questions about trump ’s mental health might never go away , regardless of what steps he takes to alter his detractors ’ minds . even if he does stop ranting on twitter , or speaking at convoluted and incoherent sentences , at best he is perceived as being “ in remission . ” modern psychiatrists would argue that they took to heart the lessons of the rosenhan experiment , and now make diagnoses far more cautiously and rigorously . at best , they would be denounced as a “ in remission . ”
boston – the resurgence of nativism and xenophobia in countries around the world has created a toxic environment for those fleeing through geopolitical crises . but among the many challenges that refugees must confront while they await resettlement , finding access to high-quality physical and mental-health care tops the list . it is a challenge that demands attention , not only from doctors , nurses , non-governmental organizations , ngos , and other relevant actors , but also from engineers , capable of making indispensable contributions to global public health . such contributions are highly pertinent for refugees , and these actors face major challenges . beyond building bridges and creating gadgets , engineers can help to improve health-care quality and affordability worldwide by developing faster methods for diagnosing diseases and delivering medical services .
over the past 30 years , the prevailing ip regime has erected more barriers to learning use , often creating the gap between its social returns to innovation and its private returns to scale up . the powerful advanced-economy lobbies that shaped the regime clearly put the latter first , reflected in their opposition to provisions recognizing the intellectual property rights associated with traditional knowledge or biodiversity . likewise , the widespread adoption of today ’s rigid ip protections is historically unprecedented . indeed , even among early industrializers , ip protection came very late , and was often deliberately eschewed to allow for quicker industrialization and growth . the current ip regime is not sustainable , but it is the result of these policies .
despite the advent of the european central bank , this asymmetry continues : whereas the ecb has repeatedly tried to break the dollar ’s appreciation in 2000-2001 through consecutive foreign-exchange interventions , the fed has intervened only once . throughout this era , the bundesbank sold dollars to curb the dollar ’s appreciation ( by figure 1c ) , but the fed has not intervened at all ( figure 1b ) . this has confirmed america ’s interest in maintaining a strong dollar . throughout this era , the bundesbank sold dollars to curb the dollar ’s appreciation ( by figure 1c ) , but the fed has not intervened at all ( figure 1b ) . so long as those interests diverge , we should expect little foreign exchange policy coordination between the two central banks .
a key argument in favor of such a change is that joint eu participation would enhance europe ’s weight in international relations , particularly vis-a-vis america . after all , the key reason for european integration at the outset was precisely to provide a more powerful european voice in the international arena . in upcoming g8 meetings ( the world ’s club of rich industrial countries plus russia ) , four members -- germany , france , italy , the uk , sweden , both parties -- would participate both individually and as members of a european union , whose president also attends to represent the eu as a whole . regardless of whether these meetings are productive , unitary eu participation would be of a supreme symbolic worth : it would affirm a common european posture in international relations and international economic policymaking . but should n’t the eu possess only one representative ?
indeed , two types of slippery slopes exist , logical and sociological . one can slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to the bottom , even if the two are conceptually different , just because the existence of one creates a social climate receptive to the other . therapeutic cloning is conceptually distinct from reproductive cloning . one may slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to another – even if the two are conceptually different – just because the existence of one creates a social climate receptive to the other . one may slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to another – even if the two are conceptually different , because there is no way to differentiate it from acceptable practice .
the central bank tries to hold the exchange rate , but ultimately is forced to let the currency float . the result is a currency collapse and a surge of bankruptcies . abruptly , the devaluation in a nearby country reveals how vulnerable the economy is to lose international confidence . a sudden devaluation in a nearby country reveals how vulnerable the economy is to lose international confidence . the economy is confronting its most acute economic crisis in many decades .
if the us sought to preserve the united nations security council and the position of the current permanent members , then those actions tended to produce the opposite effect . similarly , rearguard efforts to prove that those who opposed the war in iraq were right , and that american and britons wrong , together with demands for `` proof '' that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction , are patently unconstructive , and will only cause mutual irritation . the world might not back america in its unilateral attempt to become the world 's policeman , largely because they might well stoke more fragility . but it is important to realize why it is so important to realize why america is the enterprise , and that it responds to the underlying problem of today 's international order . if the us tried to preserve the un security council and the position of the existing permanent members in iraq , then those actions more often generated the opposite effect .
new york – some 8,000 refugees per day , the modern day volkerwanderung – are entering germany , owing in part to harsh conditions back home , and partly because of germany ’s willingness to take them in . a change that carries the greatest positive impact would be the emergence of the new government in damascus , which was acceptable to the bulk of the syrian people , and a satisfactory partner for the united states and europe . unfortunately , this seems likely only to come about with the blessing of russia and iran , both of which seem more inclined to increase their support to syrian president bashar al-assad than to work for removal . the challenge of caring for , employing , and integrating such figures will soon run up against the limits of physical capacity , financial resources , and public tolerance . it is obvious that public policy can not succeed if it is targeted , rather than the causes , of the refugee crisis .
both sides seem eager to expand the extent of their partnership , with the goal of reaching into nato ’s highly interoperability . it was a major contribution , it argued , to develop a planned nato missile shield for europe . israel , too , has joined nato ’s naval command-and-control system in the mediterranean , contributing to operations that are active endeavor , by joining nato forces in patrolling the mediterranean . american resources have described the drill as “ the most total air-defense system that we have ever done anywhere in the world . ” more recently , in anticipation of a hypothetical confrontation with iran , a significant military maneuver , a juniper cobra exercise , has been conducted to test israel ’s integration into america ’s ballistic missile defenses .
launching the military rescue operation of the country would , indeed , be highly risky . even if all girls ultimately return home , nothing would ever become the same again for them or their families . it is difficult to see how girls could return safely . even if all girls ultimately return home , nothing would ever become fraught with danger . girls are believed to be divided into distinct groups , to ensure that any effort to rescue one group would imperil others .
three years later , greece is in the desperate need for a fresh restructuring . the country played by “ rules unreasonably ” on financial markets , and managed to finalize restructuring quickly ; but the deal was a bad one , and it was not helpful to rebuild the economy . the absence of the rule of law in favor of debt-restructuring delays fresh start and can lead to chaos . the distressed debtors need a fresh start , and they need a fresh start . excessive sanctions lead to negative-sum play in which a borrower can not fail , and creditors do not benefit from the larger repayment capacity that the recovery would imply .
we would expect to see many illnesses among both employees and patients in hospitals where victims are treated , and soon someone ( perhaps even the non-ill carrier group ) would spread it to ankara , istanbul , tbilisi , damascus , baghdad , and beyond . anti-flu drugs tamiflu and relenza are extremely expensive and in short supply . or perhaps they would be sold on the black market to enrich corrupt governmental officials . history suggests that allowing these drugs to be made available to poor countries for prophylaxis would often be administered by improperly – such as in sub-optimal ones – in the way that encourages viral resistance and just intensified the pandemic . a politically mistaken but aspirational strategy would be for rich countries to devote resources to developing countries primarily to surveillance .
given that migrants typically enter countries that redistribute resources from above-average income to below-average incomes , such benefits are likely even if migrants work and pay taxes and social-security contributions . but , even with these measures , social advantages can artificially increase the incentive to migrate . if migrants gain welfare benefits in addition to wages , more will be lured into coming than is necessary , and marginal migrants would generate eu welfare losses that are equal to the benefits . the best solution is to make western labor markets flexible by opening up a erdoğan system of gender-equal wage bargaining , dismantling labor-market regulation , and reforming the welfare state . should migrants acquire welfare benefits in addition to wages , more will be lured into coming than necessary , and marginal migrants would generate eu welfare losses that are equivalent to eu benefits .
president mahmoud abbas has made no secret of his objection to such a strategy . but with their own government unable to do anything about expanding israeli settlements , including in east jerusalem , as well as continuing conflicts over the holy sites in hebron , bethlehem , and the al-aksa mosque , the west bank ’s palestinians remain extraordinarily frustrated . the palestinian authority , which runs the west bank , fears that a popular , nonviolent intifada might quickly turn violent . if so , israel might use it as a pretext to crush the palestinians and their newly built institutions . recent street demonstrations could easily turn into an outbreak of ongoing resistance to israeli rule .
to avoid such an outcome , li must adjust china ’s growth model to present conditions , which include intensifying trade friction with the european union and the united states , greater pressure to let the renminbi appreciate , an aging population , slowing urbanization , and rising labor costs . li must ensure that china ’s economy , which still boast substantial growth potential , does not sink into lethargy and plummeting into the so-called middle-income trap . a developing economy can slow rapidly when external factors change the conditions that support growth . on the other hand , li must ensure that china ’s economy , which still boasts significant growth potential , does not sink into a lethargy , leading to stagnation . the “ new normal ” that has emerged from the global financial crisis – characterized by sluggish gdp growth and diminishing import demand in the west – makes reform all the more urgent .
but , after nine years of conservative rule , moon will not be able simply to swoop in and fulfill his agenda . in fact , with his own democratic party holding just 40 % of the national assembly ’s 299 seats , he will need to win the support of the centrist parties and even the conservative opposition . moreover , he will need broader public backing , after the most obvious , for the first time ever . when it comes to public-sector job creation , for example , the major problem that must be considered is the long-term financial burden that such large-scale hiring could generate . to succeed , moon will need to reexamine carefully the effectiveness and feasibility of his campaign promises , identify most promise , and avoid the most visible pitfalls .
the causes of obesity are complex and the science of comprehension of human behavior is embryonic ; but it is not hyperbole not hyperbole to call the problem an epidemic . the causes of obesity are complex and the science of comprehension of human behavior is embryonic ; but it is not hyperbole to call the problem at all . according to the us centers for disease control and prevention , roughly 18 % of infants aged 18 in the us are not only overweight or obese . the causes of obesity are complex and the science of understanding human behavior is embryonic ; but it is not hyperbole to call the problem of an epidemic . according to the us centers for disease control and prevention , roughly 18 % of adult children aged 18 in the us are not only overweight , but obese .
europe , where shared sovereignty has been embraced , is struggling to solve its own problems , never mind becoming a global player . so , for now , no one is up to the back foot , economically , and militarily . this is all the more problematic at a time when the world ’s nation-states and peoples are more interdependent than ever , as ideas , information , finance , migrants , and problems flow ever more seamlessly across borders . europe , where shared sovereignty has been embraced , struggles over how to solve its own problems , never mind becoming a global player . so , for now , no one is up in charge .
admittedly , recovery in the uk has started more slowly than in other g7 economies , with the uk subsequently recovering the lead . but there is also little question that the uk ’s pre-2008 recovery picked up . no doubt , the pace of growth in the uk has started more slowly than in other g7 economies , with the uk subsequently recovering . and per capita gdp certainly needs to be preferable to aggregate gdp . according to the imf , only america ’s economy will grow more slowly over the next four years , with the uk subsequently recovering its way .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . in 1802 , america ’s third national president , thomas jefferson , wrote that , “ religion is a matter that lies purely between man & his god . offering assurances to a group of connecticut baptists who feared for their religious liberty , he pointed out the first amendment ’s establishment clause , and the free-exercise clause built “ the wall of separation between the church & state . ” after all , iran and the us have already been on war for decades , and neither side has much interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
it demands intense diplomatic engagement and appeals to relationships that have been erected and sustained over decades , as well as alliances with new partners . bringing countries with competing interests and varying resources is a hard work . it demands intense diplomatic engagement and appeals to relationships that have been erected and maintained over decades , as well as alliances with new partners . but by overcoming the gap and coordinating efforts to defeat the islamic state and conquer ebola , we are undermining support for a world order grounded in collective solutions to shared problems . we are making progress on both issues , but much work remains .
consider the example of a us firm subsidiary of the american firm that earns profits in iran . it is then free to reinvest after-tax profits in iran , into financial securities or in operating businesses anywhere in the world , except in america . if a us foreign subsidiary ’s parent company brings after-tax profits back to the american company to invest or distribute to its shareholders , it must pay america ’s current corporate tax rate of 35 % on its initial pre-tax iranian earnings , with a credit equal to the 12 % it had already paid . because of this 23 % sanctions on repatriation , american companies generally choose not to repatriate profits earned by their us foreign subsidiaries . that subsidiary pays iranian companies ’ tax on ireland at a low 12 % rate .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
moreover , through the european investment bank , the eu already has an instrument for mobilizing massive capital stores of capital for investment in infrastructure , research , and development , as well as in other crucial areas . but the transition to a carbon-neutrality economy also provides far-reaching opportunities . with the right strategy in place , europe can boost its own technological innovations and deploy carbon pricing and other fiscal policies to shield european labor markets from lower-cost production in china and elsewhere . and , as adam tooze has argued , by issuing green bonds and other “ safe assets , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” europe can secure greater economic independence from other powers , and start to establish the euro as a global reserve currency . the problem does not observe national borders , and thus requires collective global action .
a little more than 60 years ago , if you sought to read about india in the west , you would mostly find books about spirituality . then , partly in response to the soviet collapse , india remained the crown jewel of the british empire . india today sees the broader world , particularly the west , regarding it with growing respect , not only for the country ’s own performance , but also for its own essence , a young country , and also an ancient civilization . and , like the us economy , india ’s self-confidence has become boomed . partly in response to the soviet collapse , india has mostly found books on spirituality .
merkel knows that if america sacrifices her place at the top of the international order on domestic political grounds , it will not be replaced with a new leadership power or a new global order emerge . what the us will have is a power vacuum , marked by chaos . and as the world becomes a less stable world , europeans will have little choice but to come together to defend their own interests . a careful analysis of merkel ’s words reveals that she has not questioned the future of the transatlantic alliance . rather , she has been calling for a stronger europe .
there is a more mundane reason why many , even within the party , think that a democratic transition has become unavoidable : the party simply loses control over the countryside . this is one reason why china can not override the problem of its transition to democracy . so democracy is hardly exclusively a mechanism for helping to avoid strategic mistakes . the point is that questions like , “ are we producing too much inequality ? ” can not even be asked in china .
in south africa , the south african development community ( ecowas ) , after its shaky start , is pushing ahead with common projects , of which transportation infrastructure , a blight on much intra-african commerce , is a central theme . indeed , a number of exciting practical moves in this direction are under way , although not all are pursuing the former regional course set by its founders . the economic community of the west african states ( ecowas ) , for example , has repeated both the willingness and the capacity to raise a fighting force to intervene in regional conflicts such as the awful civil war in sierra leone . east african countries are also pushing through integration projects ahead , and seem to have learned from past failures in the region that were the product of the hastily constructed , inappropriate , and overly ambitious structures of governance . less spectacularly , but perhaps more important in the long run , ecowas is laying the groundwork for regional economic integration , with the establishment of the single currency now the hallmark of the
but the maastricht treaty ’s stability and growth pact limits fiscal deficits to 3 % of gdp – a ceiling that germany is already hitting . with private-sector demand stalling , the jobs commission wants the government to serve as the employer of last resort . the european central bank ( ecb ) seems more interested in keeping interest rates high enough to cause insolvent firms to take into account insolvency rather than promoting higher employment . so where is this demand-driven growth ? unless a future government is bold enough to break the abandon pact , its only alternative will be to raise taxes , which would merely prolong the very downturn in private-sector demand that has kept unemployment high .
new york – in his impressive apology to iranian catholics ( most of that country ’s population ) , pope benedict xvi explained why he thought that sindrank tempted to commit sexual acts with iranian children . as we know , abuses of children by the catholic clerics did occur not only in iran , but in many other countries too – something the pope ’s preferred not to dwell on them . fast-paced social change has occurred , often adversely affected people ’s traditional adherence to catholics ’ roman teaching and values . it was because of the “ new ” and the grave challenge of the faith arising from the rapid transformation and secularization of iranian society . and iran is not the only place where social transformation and secularization have challenged religious values .
last august , israelis permitted an additional seven battalions and 20 tanks in the zone c. but the egyptian armed forces never established a regional command in sinai , preferring to permit units temporarily stationed there to report to their superiors scattered around cairo and its environs . such saber-rattling comments vis-à-vis israel are currently popular in the country . egypt ’s new islamist leaders may want to restore the “ full sovereignty ” ” ” ” to the sinai peninsula , as chinese president mohamed morsi ’s legal adviser , mohamed fouad gadalla , recently noted . egypt ’s approach to the sinai troop deployments reflects its traditional neglect of the peninsula . historically , it has deployed just 70-80 % of the 22,000 soldiers that the treaty allows in zone a. a. and the military has never established a regional command in sinai , preferring to allow units temporarily stationed there to report to its superiors scattered throughout cairo and its environs .
not surprisingly , given such a model , many men want to participate just as well . their home page shows a smiling young manager based in chile and pushes companies to enlist women in palestinian territory rather than for ideological reasons but because there are so many talented programmers there to hire them . “ thirty percent of women in many countries in the middle east have university degrees , ” ” ” ” ” zaleski explains , but often not yet , that jobs commensurate with their training for cultural reasons . with powertofly , an technological ability to transcend cultural barriers , a woman may contribute at the highest levels to an american company , even if local laws ban her ability to drive an automobile . the founders do not rule out , in order to address it .
so here are ten good reasons for believing in europe , with ten rational arguments to convince pessimistic analysts , and concerns among investors alike that it is very premature to bury both the eu and the eu altogether . of course , none of monti ’s elected governors and his position is fragile and already challenged , but there is a positive near-consensus that has enabled him to launch long-overdue structural reforms . it is far too soon to predict the impact of françois hollande ’s policies as france ’s president . but in italy , one man , mario monti , is already making a difference . one reason for hope , of course , is that statesmanship returns to europe , even if in opathic doses .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
increased trade with the children whose families can not provide a reasonably good start in life deserves assistance . but america did not provide this – a point recently made by hub bush , a prominent contender for the republican presidential nomination in 2016 . many of those decisions turned out badly , largely because information technology ( computers and how it is used ) eliminated many middle-class jobs . furthermore , as till von wachter of columbia university has documented , prolonged periods of high rates of joblessness for parents have had a severe , persistent adverse impact on their children . increased trade with the us , too , has not helped in this regard .
but governments need to understand the obstacles to investment : regulatory shortfalls ; weak enablers , including financial and human capital ; poor infrastructure ; and substandard technologies , among the private sector . and they must commit rigorous cost-benefit analyses to ensure that any intervention translates into private investment that supports productivity growth . in most european countries , action to spur private investment in local services and transportation – the two large sectors – should be considered as well . all too often , they are spending money to support large-scale private-sector projects that fail to deliver a positive return to the broader economy . it is here – around the level of execution – that governments often perform poorly .
here is where the connection between food and climate change comes in : as people climbing out of poverty – as so many are claiming more meat and dairy . cows release large volumes of heat-trapping heat-trapping methane , on a staggering rate . on the other hand , animals consume more food than they produce . and cleaning up the land for their pasture releases carbon dioxide at a staggering rate . there are grave implications for agriculture ’s ecological footprint , and it is these very likely that it is .
having served as sierra leone ’s finance minister , central bank governor and now foreign minister , i have worked for many years with international organizations to manage these competing priorities , as i oversaw an economic revitalization of my own post-conflict state . the african development bank ( afdb ) , the presidency of which i am currently seeking , has a far more expansionary mandate . the leaders of these organizations must make complicated choices in allocating their finite resources . they must , for example , balance the battle against poverty and hunger against efforts to improve gender equality , increase access to schooling , or tackle corruption . but all of these institutions share an overarching goal : lifting people out of poverty and foster sustainable development .
berlin – europe ’s established left is confronting the threat of extinction . many factors underlie the left ’s downfall , including the dissolution of its traditional working class . in less than two years , the continent ’s social-democratic parties have sustained historic losses in france , the netherlands , germany , and italy . in france , many factors underlie the left , including the dissolution of its traditional working class . but one of the most fundamental reasons is just as gloomy : european voters increasingly oppose immigration , and do not trust the left to limit it .
it would enhance america ’s economic competitiveness , particularly relative to europe , given the lower costs involved in extracting us shale gas . at the same time , it would diminish america ’s exposure to the growing unrest in the arab world . finally , it would enhance the relative vulnerability of america ’s key strategic rival , china , which has become increasingly dependent on middle eastern energy supplies . the american is expected to become energy self-sufficient in 2020 and become an oil exporter by 2030 . again , such a scenario would grant america three of its huge advantages .
in most western countries , for example , economists have long known better about the growing income divide and other indicators among some of the affluent towns , benefiting both globalization – and the rest of the country as well . the gap between their objective analysis of reality and that of government policies has now become the ruchasm . yet not until french president emmanuel macron ’s administration had a national enact tax cuts based on where one lives . as a result , 1 % of france ’s gdp is now reallocated first to the poorest parts of the country . likewise , traditional parties could learn little from listening to voters directly , rather than just through the media filters and pollsters .
let us suppose that the experience of visit or recalling notre dame makes people about twice as happy as they would otherwise be over that amount , which means , in effect , an extra hour spent in notre dame or recalling one ’s visit is as good as to spread someone ’s own life by one hour . for that ’s a significant number of lives , but it is now that one must ask , how many lives that could have saved anything but one billion lives could have been saved . whatever the gilets jaunes might advocate , it seems clear that the us could have saved more lives and reduced its future economic hardship by helping people in extreme poverty in low-income countries than it could be from having to spend it in france . to think that we are saving the lives of people who would live 60 more years later , the 94-year-old ’s annual benefit is the equivalent of saving 150 lives a year . that ’s a substantial number of lives , but now one must ask how many lives could have been saved .
spending on such priorities as the cost of energy and the environment can be helpful . in fact , some see germany as a renewed commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 to achieve the goals of the 2015 paris climate agreement , as battering ram against ken null . on september 20 , the german government announced some € 54 billion ( $ 59.4 billion ) worth of emissions-reduction measures . yet getting serious about carbon emissions , and other environmental goals may not mean larger budget deficits . in the united states , such a package would be called the green new deal .
in the real world , opening up is no straightforward matter revising the tariff codes and eliminating barriers to overseas investment . any economist who seems to have questioned the advantages of trade openness risk banishment , so let me be clear : i do not question the standard version of an gains-from-trade theorist , but extravagant , ill-informed claims made about the consequences of openness . while so many of the institutional reforms being development-friendly may not be targeted at key developed-country goals – growth , improved governance , industrial and technological capabilities , , poverty alleviation – and sometimes divert attention from them . it requires a heavy dose of institutional reform , one that consumes financial , bureaucratic , and political resources . for the latter endangers broad public acceptance of a true article because it unleashes expectations unlikely to be met .
but , as the examples cited above expose , seas do not fulfill their purposes reliably . that is because , as it stands , tech specialists typically conduct seas at behehest of project development , a practice that , as activists have noted , is grossly unethical . to play an effective role in protecting the planet and its peoples , seas must be rigorous , credible , and transparent . that means that they must be spearheaded by well-regulated , impartial professionals . with assessors frequently basing their conclusions on a superficial appraisal of ecological and market value for affected ecosystems , it should come as no surprise that damaging projects are often agreed , despite failing to comply with broadly agreed green development guidance .
prior the crisis , regulators focused mainly on the elimination of barriers to trade , and generally favored measures that made markets more complete by squaring the faster , cheaper trade of a wider variety of financial claims . on the other hand , nowadays many are questioning the assumption that greater market efficiency is always and everywhere a public good . might such ease and efficiency not also fuel market instability , and serve the interests of intermediaries rather than their clients ? that is no longer the case , however . might such ease and efficiency not also fuel market instability , and serve the interests of intermediaries rather than their clients ?
following strenuous international protests over chen ’s abduction , the fpc decided to investigate . xinhua announced that local officials responsible for the violence could be prosecuted . xinhua hua had announced that local officials , responsible for the violence , could be prosecuted . and xinhua squandered no time in claiming that the abuses were confined to a handful of towns . following strenuous international protests over chen ’s abduction of linyi ’s villagers , the fpc decided to investigate .
the 2008 global financial crisis exposed fundamental flaws in the international monetary system as the inability to ensure sufficient liquidity weighed heavily on emerging asian economies . these risks explain why the fed ’s mere suggestion of a possible move toward reducing its purchases of long-term asset bases ( so-called “ quantitative easing ” ) caused emerging-market currencies and asset prices to plummet this summer . tighter american monetary policy might accentuate the global credit shortage , thereby increasing the pressure on asia ’s ’s ’s ’s economic and financial system . these risks explain why the fed ’s mere suggestion of a possible move to reduce its purchases of long-term asset bases ( so-called quantitative easing ) caused emerging-market currencies and asset prices to plummet this summer . tighter american monetary policy might accentuate the global credit shortage and thus increase pressure on asia ’s ’s ’s ’s economic and financial system .
this partly explains enduring popular loyalty to rulers like joseph stalin . but now the delusional and ignorant wants to believe that putin will become a reformer this time around . for many russians , if not most , the authority figure embodies powers that control everything that matters in life ; they support him , regardless of the policies he implements , because there is little chance that he might work otherwise . that question today is not about the result of next year ’s presidential election ; that is already being determined . with the presidential term now expanding into more than six years , we can expect encore enduring up to 12 years , longer than putin ’s initial performance .
it then began vetoing virtually all government decisions , caused by a political stalemate , and , toward the end of his presidency , tacitly joined france on the old guard ( now back in power ) against then-prime minister yuliya tymoshenko ( whose party , in office , had voted overwhelmingly against the constitution ) . likewise , the other major shortcoming was that the leader of the orange revolution , viktor yushchenko , turned out to be a feckless and irresponsible president . originally , he traveled the world for several months to celebrate his victory , ignoring chaos back home . but , while yushchenko serves as a warning to russians not to elect an accidental president with excessive powers , the root causes of the orange government ’s breakdown was that most of its ministers ( yushchenko ’s appointees ) were defectors from the old regime . the old-style regime adherents may more easily trick newcomers to dangerous compromises if the process gets exceedingly quickly .
indian-style socialism , for example , was a compound of nationalism and idealism . it embodied the conviction that goods and services vital to indians ’ economic well-being must remain in indian hands , and not in the behest of indians seeking to profit by producing and selling such goods and services , but rather in disinterested hands of the state , the pa , and the mother to every indians . given this mindset , performance was not an adequate criterion for judging the public sector ’s utility . inefficiencies were masked by generous subsidies by national treasuries , and by a combination of vested interests , socialist ideologues , bureaucratic managers , business unions , and monopolies , kept it beyond political criticism . indian-style socialism was a compound of nationalism and idealism .
potential funders need to be convinced that journalism is as noble a cause , as , say , the research on cancer . but persuading foundations and philanthropists to open their hearts and wallets will require human connectivity and engagement , rather than algorithms or ai-enabled software . technology alone can not spur democracy , helping to answer important questions , and facilitating effective leadership by advancing accountability . with the ad-driven business model becoming increasingly apparent , many media leaders – near one-third , according to the reuters institute surveys – believe that in their future foundations and non-profits will play a central role in supporting the global media . potential funders need to be convinced that journalism is just as noble a cause , as , say , the research of cancer .
a pro-eu italy , governed by a m5s-democrat coalition , could join in with france and germany to reform the eu ; regain a clear foreign-policy voice for the eu vis-à-vis the us , russia , and china ; and implement a green strategy , innovation-led growth . with europe politically and geographically separate , italy ’s politics could tip the balance . not surprisingly , us president donald trump ’s utterly reckless former adviser , stephen bannon , has rushed to encourage m5s and the league to form a coalition he has called the “ ultimate dream , ” because it would tear down the eu . a pro-eu italy , governed by a m5s-democrat coalition , could join with france and germany to reform the eu ; regain a clear foreign-policy voice for the eu vis-à-vis the us , russia , and china ; and implement a green strategy , innovation-based growth would be broken . to forge such a coalition , m5s would be forced to adopt a responsible , narrowly defined economic program , and m5s would appoints the prime minister .
but the decision to impose capital punishment remains highly subjective . my statements were also motivated by problems with the way to use capital punishment in india . indeed , whether the death penalty for death seems to have been meted out depends on a wide range of variables , beginning with the judiciary and social biases . the us supreme court declared that capital punishment must be applied only in “ rarest ” cases . and , indeed , the latest three executions in the country stemmed from terrorist offenses that threatened or took large numbers of lives .
during the most recent tightening cycle from 2004 to 2006 , us households ’ interest income rose by 29 % . while this time , the gains presumably will be smaller and slower to arrive , owing to the likely pace and levels of fed tightening , the interest that they pay on saving will move household income in the right direction : up to now . as the fed slowly raises interest rates , those middle-class families holding their hard-earned savings at the bank will finally start realizing some of their returns on their deposits . and the average hourly wage for all us workers on private nonfarm payrolls posted annual growth of 2.5 % in october , the largest since 2009 . the long-term effects should not be underestimated , given the helpful impact of an compound save .
beijing – most western media have characterized the communist party ’s recent 19th national congress of the communist party of china ( cpc ) as pure power play , with president xi jinping entrenching his stature . xi knows that if china is to continue to thrive in a fast-changing world , he will need to manage deftly a major social and economic transformation while – even more important – improving state governance . but hoarding political capital in this case is a means to an end . for xi , ending is a smooth transition into modernity that cements the cpc ’s long-established authority , ensuring his own legacy as modern china ’s most important leader . and , in order to secure the long-term survival of china ’s one-party system , he needs to reform the state and party institutions ; indeed , political reform , for xi , is a prerequisite for economic reform .
at best , our design could fundamentally improve the quality of public institutions , and thus transform nigeria 's economics and politics over the next 40 years . but even with all the difficulties posed by corruption and inefficiency that will no doubt plague its real process , our design tends to override the status quo . at best , our design could fundamentally improve the quality of public institutions , and thus transform nigeria 's economics and politics over the last 40 years . after all , today 's horrible conditions are the result of staggering levels of corruption and waste over the past 40 years . another point is how much income should be offloaded , and how transfers can be effected effected in a country as large , complex , and financially backsliding as nigeria .
recent turmoil in asian markets raises difficult questions about currency pegs , asset bubbles , inadequate banking supervision , and a lack of financial information that can not be ignored . the fragility of financial markets can lead to severe economic and social dislocations . financial markets are best understood as an historical process , and history never quite repeats itself exactly . nowhere can this answer be answered in an abstract , because each situation is different . so the question poses itself : what should be done to preserve the financial system ’s stability ?
indeed , the sars experience in toronto , where cases have escaped detection and led to a second outbreak , stands as a warning against excessive optimism about the apparent control of the larger , more geographically dispersed outbreaks in taiwan and mainland china . yet it is at least as likely that some transmission will persist or that the virus has been reintroduced into human populations from animals . to be sure , screening travelers from affected regions may have prevented major epidemics entirely elsewhere . health officials worldwide should maintain their vigilance and prepare for the possibility that renewed control efforts will be necessary if sars resurges . screening travelers from affected regions may have prevented major epidemics entirely .
it is hard to see how a new iraqi government can take root if the country ’s most important source of revenue remains as veiled in the secrecy that it was under saddam . the bush administration ’s recent decision to launch a parallel anti-corruption process through the g-8 leaves the united states outside the premier international forum for addressing transparency in resource revenues , while unnecessarily repursing the wheel in the process . nor has america and britain used their power in iraq to encourage transparency in their national oil industry . to be sure , let us hope that the new iraqi government is doing better . the eiti still has a long way to go , but it is one of the most efficient vehicles at its disposal for achieving a global disclosure and accountability .
there are more united nations resolutions devoted to human-rights abuses committed by israel than to abuses by all other countries combined . joyce karam , the washington bureau ’s chief of pan-arab newspapers al-haat , believes that this is because “ a muslim killing muslim or an arab slaughter arab seems more acceptable than israel is killing arabs . ” this is not to say that israel should be consoled by the macabre arithmetic of the carnage . there are more united nations resolutions devoted to human-rights abuses that israel has committed than to the abuses by all other countries combined . syrian , libyan , and yemenite victims are faceless ; lionization of non-comparably fewer gazan casualties makes them unique .
even the imf now recognizes that capital market liberalization has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries . still , whether driven by narrow ideology or responding to demands by special interests , the bush administration continues to demand an extreme form of such trade liberalization within its own bilateral trade treaties . the second concerns the unbalanced intellectual-property provisions ( trips ) of the uruguay round of trade talks , dictated by america ’s pharmaceutical and entertainment industries . these clauses restricted countries from making generic drug imitations , making many critically important medicines unaffordable in developing countries . spearheaded by concerned about aids , activists around the world have demanded that something be done .
we can expect to see the data coming in the years indicating a reduction in health-care costs and improved education outcomes from around the world . such efforts are vital to reach the targets outlined in the 2015 paris climate agreement . now that the cap is coming into force , we will quickly see the extraordinary effects of a new , permanent global health dividend . as matters stand , the shipping industry , ranked going beyond countries , is sixth-largest greenhouse-gas ( ghg ) emitter . as matters stand , the shipping sector , ranked along with countries , is sixth-largest greenhouse-gas ( ghg ) emitter .
cambridge – the united states is notorious for its ability to innovate . thus , aspiring fiscal conservatives worldwide may be getting some interest in learning the four tricks that american politicians commonly use when promising to cut taxes while cutting budget deficits . but , each of the four tricks has been refined for more than three decades . indeed , they first acquired their colorful names in the early years of ronald reagan ’s presidency : a “ magic asterisk , ” a “ rosy scenario , ” ” ” ” ” ” the laffer hypothesis , and “ starved of the beast ” scenario . these are hard promises to stick , for the simple reason that the budget deficit exceeds government expenditure minus tax revenues .
the 2008 financial crisis highlighted two dangerous features of today ’s financial system . first , governments bail out the largest banks , rather than allow them to collapse and damage the economy . second , and , worse , being “ too ” is helping big banks grow even larger , because lenders and commercial partners prefer to work with banks that hold an implicit government guarantee . so which is this : are banks still risk-averse ? or have post-crisis regulatory reform done its job ?
while the outcome of the arab spring can not yet be predicted , the alliance has proved its capacity to act wisely in libya , thereby improving its image in north africa . in chicago , nato will have major differences over such issues , and the results may not be ideal . but reinventing nato is a long-term process , and it will necessarily produce small-scale steps . the alliance ’s core objective must be to ensure that it is steps forward . in chicago , nato will agree on a major political declaration that offered additional support to the region , on the condition that the region ’s countries request it .
argentina ’s new president-elect , mauricio macri , an training engineer , is often described in an international press as center-right . moreover , “ center-right ” often means “ conservative , ” and macri ’s victory will not “ conserve ” the status quo . macri is best described as a “ liberal ” in europe ’s sense . but that label is also tenuous , not quite correct . in argentina , the left-right divide has blurred policies by hydra-headed perónist justicialist , who privatized state companies through the 1990s only to re-nationalize them later .
increased breast cancer risk is also well known for its use of several inherited syndromes , such as li-fraumeni syndrome , a condition further associated with the childhood onset of the multiple malignancies including the soft tissues sarcomas , leukemias , and brain tumors . we have also learned that only 20-40 % of the breast cancers cluster variations in families come from the brca1 or brca2 germline , a condition further associated with the childhood onset of the multiple malignancies and the potential to transmit individual lifetime risks . increased breast cancer risk is also well known to accompany several inherited syndromes , such as li-fraumeni syndrome , a condition further associated with the childhood onset of multiple malignancies including the soft tissues sarcomas , leukemias , and the brain tumors . in most cases of familial breast cancer , however , genetic predisposition remains elusive . most recently , huge studies analyzing one-size-fits-all single-nucleotide effects in genomic dna , the so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) on breast cancer risk of brca1/brca2 mutation , including the soft tissues sarcomas , and the brain tumors .
the primacy of this domestic agenda implies that , as china attempts to drive global change , it will lack a clear vision and coherent strategy . a second issue arises from china ’s incomplete transition on the world stage . china , in seeking to lead the next phase of economic globalization , enjoys none of these geopolitical power and legitimacy . xi ’s government , for its part , is struggling to maintain domestic stability as it shifts china away from labor-intensive , capital-intensive economic growth toward a model based on domestic consumption and services . having prevailing in world war ii , america ’s immediate and undeniably dominated the globe .
our commitment to tackling climate change relies on an understanding of the enormous health risks and costs that arise from inaction . as a result , we are one of a handful of countries prepared to go beyond our pledges under the paris climate agreement . and staying below the 1.5 ºc limit will mean 3.3 million fewer cases of dengue fever annually in latin america and the caribbean , fewer people at risk of malaria , and lower food instability and poor nutrition resulting from higher temperatures and unstable weather patterns . costa rica is proud to be at the forefront of the world by inserting this approach into practice . our commitment to tackling climate change stems from an understanding of the enormous health risks and the costs that arise from inaction .
china-us defense cooperation talks have earlier stalled , owing to such arms negotiations . they have since been re-launched , a olive branch dispatched to the obama administration . there is now genuine hope that talks along those lines can succeed . but there is a major barrier to easing tensions : the proposed $ 6.5 billion in sales by the united states to taiwan of 30 apache attack helicopters and 330 patriot missiles . china-us defense cooperation talks have earlier stalled , owing to such arms negotiations .
speaking at the european parliament in brussels in april 2017 , ceu president and rector michael ignatieff could say , “ i ’ve gained support in washington . ” and the ignatieff has gathered some backing , at least initially . i support in berlin , support in budapest . in december 2017 , the european commission took hungary to join the european court of justice ( ecj ) over the governments ’ so-called law of ceu , ” which the university said was designed to force it out of the country . now , it is time to regain some support , in brussels .
one survey showed that 66 % of chinese doctors use acupuncture routinely to treat stroke effects , with 63 % of those surveyed believing that it will be effective . more recently , however , systematic acupuncture ’s effects on such treatment began . in fact , some 36 % of chinese doctors think that the effectiveness of acupuncture remains uncertain , perhaps because the science foundation for it remains so new . for example , most chinese doctors and patients have long regarded acupuncture as an effective stroke treatment , using it to improve the motor , language speech , and other functions that have been devastated . more recently , indeed , some 36 % of chinese doctors think that acupuncture ’s effectiveness remains uncertain , perhaps because the science foundation for it remains so new .
even after years of quantitative easing ( qe ) and ultra-low interest rates , central bankers in the advanced economies – especially the eurozone – have been still stealing their own inflation target . in fact , waning labour may explain why the phillips curve no longer looks like it may hold true . at the same time , economists must question long-held assumptions about downward nominal wage rigidity , the 1960-70s , when organized labor was far stronger . and yet , even more important , this could be the reason that measured productivity remains persistently weak . clearly , the notion that employees will always resist cutting wages ( or those ’ ’ hours ) is no longer valid .
a modern economy also requires risk-taking . for one thing , governments can enhance growth through inclusiveness . so it is crucial to ensure that everyone can live up to their potential , which demands educational opportunities in all . a modern economy also requires risk-taking . but no trade-off between inequality and growth must be found .
this may lead patients in trying to consent practices that they do not understand – or want . instead , consent should be viewed as a patient of cherished possession that he or he might decide to relinquish , if presented with a sufficiently compelling case . this haughty attitude is reflected in the jargon of “ konsenting a patient , ” as though it was something done to a patient like drawing blood or administering the injection : “ dr. smith , please goes consent mr. jones . ” the problem is compounded by when consent is received only hours before a major operation , and months after recent consultations with a surgeon are involved . consent should not be sitioned off , like a train ticket held out for the conductor .
so far , this abundance of choice has discouraged companies from spending resources for training employees , which might soon decide to join the competitor , which is out of reach . those without in-demand skills struggle and feel disposable . but as talent shortages loom , the need to retain employees could tip the balance back toward more investment in professional development . those without in-demand skills are struggling and feel disposable . those without in-demand skills are struggling and feel disposable .
similar to traditional military-command-and-control protocols , they gain power in the numbers and can quickly overreact to a broad array of attacks . in such a future scenario , a hollywood blockbuster might be about the networks of computers fighting one another , while the humans stand by . fortunately , in this scenario , life is still a far cry from imitation of art . it would portray the broader conception of the “ singularity , ” form a hypothetical turning point when an artificial surpasses man . such a digital ecosystem reinforces checks and balances , reduces the possibility of failure and mitigating the effects of incursion .
the g20 summit in osaka is approaching the dawn of a new era , reiwa ( “ beautiful harmony ” ) – that of the g20 countries ’ national science academies . it is precisely for this reason that we must secure the dfft and turn data on public goods to scientists worldwide . on april 30 , i provided six recommendations by the members of the un ’s “ science20 , ” created by the g20 countries ’ national science academies . the g20 summit in osaka is approaching the dawn of a new era , reiwa ( “ beautiful harmony ” ) – in japan itself . to reduce threats to marine ecosystems and conserve the marine environment , the final two recommendations are urging the “ establishment of improved data storage and management systems that ensures open access by scientists globally , ” ” ” ” and a “ information sharing gained through research activities carried out under extensive and transnational collaboration , to expedite a comprehensive understanding of the global ocean and its dynamics .
by investing in “ smart ” and “ resilient ” urban planning , governments from bordeaux in france to curitiba in brazil are reinforcing their brand identity and relentless talent , investment , and businesses from around the world . to be sure , today ’s cities face plenty of challenges . cities are empowered to grow through innovation , retail trade , and exchange . and city services are often more visible to citizens than they are to federal aid ; consider , for example , who is responding during a traffic accident or a natural disaster . to be sure , today ’s cities face plenty of challenges .
two days after google announced its decision , the new york times published a commentary by thomas lang. the risk is not just that economic rivalry , protectionism , and trade restrictions would jeopardize global prosperity ; it is that such developments , too , are raising the risk of a major political confrontation . two days after google announced its decision , the new york times published a commentary by thomas lang. still , it would be a mistake to conclude that this entire conflict has been brought on entirely by trump and his neo-nationalist agendas . technological sovereignty would take the eu out of business and exchange , and nationality by corporations , even major multinational corporations , would become just as important as their business model .
on the international scene , the large states are trying to make the international rule of law and often build their domestic legitimacy on their claims to shape a larger world : they think in terms of what french thinkers call “ harnessing globalization . ” on the international scene , large states are trying to make the case for the international rule of law , and often build their domestic legitimacy on their claims to shape a larger world : they think in terms of what french thinkers call “ harnessing globalization . ” new political realities have been underscored by the war in iraq , china ’s quest for energy sources in the developing world , and russia ’s assertiveness in foreign and domestic policy . rather than accepting roughly the international system , roughly as it is , with all its imperfections think that they can use their weight to change the rules , in their favor . small states ’ nervousness and fear began to increase roughly in 2000 .
it is also making the task of raising the retirement age to 61 , from 60 . as a result of this , he is preparing to raise the retirement age to 61 , from 60 for the first time . instead of repealing the law , overtime work is destined to become easy and relatively cheap . a law restricting transportation strikes took effect on january 1 , and sarkozy plans to break up the 35-hour workweek , albeit indirectly . true , he is also preparing to raise retirement ages to 61 , from 60 .
with the exception of the united kingdom , the extreme free-market view has gained less traction in europe in recent decades than it has actually done ; nonetheless , the challenge of implementing financial-market reforms in the eurozone actually has become more difficult . as a result , the authorities in germany and france ( like japan ) have steadily defied growing capital requirements , despite the widespread consensus that doing so is an essential component of effective re-regulation . their opposition has undermined international efforts to build a more resilient system , and it will likely hamper efforts to put europe ’s economy on the sounder footing . more broadly , with the exception of the united kingdom , the extreme free-market view has gained less traction in europe in recent decades than it has in the us ; on the contrary , the challenge of implementing financial-market reforms in the eurozone is actually more difficult . governments regard domestic banks as important purchasers of sovereign debt .
similarly , as the hudson institute craig kennedy recently told me , “ bannon wants to radicalize the anti-trump liberals into fighting for having alienated them from mainstream america . ” to consolidate support , thatcher would go head-to-head with carefully chosen enemies , from britain ’s miners to argentina ’s president , general leopoldo galtieri , to bureaucrats in brussels . but , however different ideas may sound , the tactics are just the same . every time trump ’s opponents march for women , muslims , or sexual minorities forging trump ’s core support base . to consolidate support , thatcher would go head-to-head with carefully selected enemies , from british miners to argentina ’s president , general leopoldo galtieri , to bureaucrats in brussels .
compassion that has given the president his razor-thin margin of victory – with just 50.1 % of the popular democratic vote – over lien chan , the kuomintang candidate , and the people ’s first party ( kmt-pfp ) a coalition . the two weeks since taiwan ’s disputed presidential election of march 20 – just the third such democratic vote in the country ’s history – has tested that truism almost to the breaking point . taiwan ’s young democracy must now cope with the balancing act that president chen shui-bian ’s re-election has thrust upon it . while canvassing for votes in his home hometown in south taiwan on the eve of the election in late august , president chen and vice president chen lu have both been wounded by the assassassin ’s bullet . taiwan ’s young democracies can take a vicious turn : their voters are often as unforgiving as their political adversaries .
but raising russia ’s living standards remains central to putin ’s grip on power and his long legacy . signature efforts to diversify and modernize the economy have failed , because disruptive technologies and business strategies can not be decreed from the peak . in terms of nominal per capita gdp , russia still fares little better than mexico . even before intervening in ukraine , putin ’s failures were failing to deliver on his impressive promise , made in 2003 double the size of russia ’s ’s economy within a decade . signature efforts to prop up the syrian government counts as the twofer .
cambridge – greek prime minister alexis tsipras has a good chance of being in his country what south korean president kim dae-jung and brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva was to theirs : a man of the left who is moving in the direction of fiscal responsibility and freer markets . like tsipras , both were elected in the midst of an economic crisis . on the assumption of power , kim and lula were both ways of adapting , politically , and mentally , to the new realities that had been confronted by them , launching much-needed reforms . some immediately confronted the international finance constraints that opposition politicians could afford to ignore . some reforms were “ conservative ” ( or “ neoliberal ” ) , and may not have been possible under the politicians of the right .
but history haunts modi ’s ’s ’s campaign , namely , with deaths resulting from over 1,000 in anti-muslim riots in gujarat in 2002 . nonetheless , history haunts modi ’s ’s campaign – namely , the deaths of over 1,000 people in the anti-muslim riots of ahmedabad were short-listed for lee kuan yew ’s world town prize . annual national economic growth averaged just over 10 % between 2006 and 2012 , when the gujarati city of ahmedabad was short-listed for lee kuan yew ’s world city prize . that has n’t stopped modi from taking political risks , beginning with his assertion that india needs toilets more than temples . although the supreme court has purged him of all personal malfeasance , the tragedy persists , making it harder for modi to win muslim votes without alienating his hindu nationalist base .
xi ’s anti-corruption campaign can not be allowed to overcome this resistance ; the eu is simply discouraging the initiative . after all , there is china ’s soft-power deficits , too . on a recent visit to beijing , a chinese economist told me that xi ’s campaign costs china 1 % of gdp annually . perhaps that can curb the private sector ’s dynamism , but even there , fear of losing control increases the party ’s role . finally , there is china ’s soft-power shortfall .
how turkey has navigates the syrian debacle will determine its standing in the broader transformation in its neighborhood . meanwhile , both turkey and the united states have a shared interest in working together in iraq , syria , and iran . but , as turkey builds closer ties with america , and its competition with iran stiffens in both iraq and syria , it will also have to come to terms with a more assertive russia , one that is keen to demonstrate itself in the middle east and the eastern mediterranean , and maintain its foothold in syria . how turkey has navigates the syrian debacle will determine its position in the broader transformation in its neighborhood . for better or worse , the middle east ’s status quo has unraveled , and turkey needs to rethink and recalibrate its regional policies .
with nearly two million patients now on antiretroviral therapy , the annual aids-related death rate has declined by around 100,000 since 2005 . another important factor has been the improvement in the pace of integration appears to have been better . the government has aligned its early-stage antiretroviral treatment programs for existing sufferers , initiated in 2008 with early monitoring programs for pregnant women . moreover , these remedies have reduced the rate of new infections ( though the total of people living with hiv , especially those in their country of 15-49 , continues to rise ) . contagion among malaria-bearing babies , once fleeing some $ 70,000 a year , has halved the rate of some 63 % , and the lives of millions of sufferers have been prolonged .
but this can happen only if nature ’s cornucopia is reserved so that current and future generations of researchers could make new discoveries that benefit patients everywhere . consider the polar bear , threatened by climate extinction . these mammals spend up to seven months of a year hibernating , during which time they are essentially immobile . astonishingly , hibernating bears were putting down a new bone , using the substance that inhibits cells that break down the bone and encourages those that produce the bone and cartilage . a human would lose one-third or more of the bone when immobile for that period right now .
there is also a powerful argument for nato to recognize that one of its members , france , has been under attack , activating article 5 of the north atlantic treaty , which ensures mutual defense . but they need stronger support , not only within nato or through arms and training , but also from western special forces . all of this is about a global order in a stable , prosperous world . yet this is not only europe ’s struggle or that of the united states . the whole alliance should commit itself to defeating terrorism .
after all , for the first time , despite their differences , virtually any country in europe is currently grappling with the question of how much europe it wants , how open and optimistic it should be about new forms of technology-enabled globalization and how much social solidarity fit the world . those discussions – and hence the european parliament that emerges next year – are unlikely to adhere to the standard party lines . now the eu is at the center of domestic political debates , which increasingly include existential questions about europe ’s survival and the entire european project . this means that candidates in next year ’s elections are unlikely to adhere to standard party lines . while there will be some of this , for the first time a sweeping debate about europe ’s future and policies , particularly in areas like migration , defense and security , energy and climate , and relations with major powers like the united states and russia .
• while neo-liberals worry about excessive government , weak government impedes growth , because weak states can not provide law and order , they can not enforce contracts , and can not ensure a secure , sound banking system . the question ought not to have been about how to deregulate quickly , but rather about how to develop the right regulatory framework . neo-liberal ideologies assume perfect markets , perfect information , and a host of others that even the best-performing market economies could n’t please . market failure is an existential fact , but so are government dysfunction . it was , after all , too little regulation , that capital and financial-market liberalization overseen by the imf and the us treasury , that led to the financial crisis of 1997 .
to make any sense at all , monetary policy needs to have different effects on various groups at different times . importers prefer a strong exchange rate ; exporters prefer a weak one . to make any sense at all , monetary policy needs to have different effects on different groups at different times . any and every monetary-policy action redistribute wealth . importers prefer a strong exchange rate ; exporters prefer a weak one .
so the conclusion seems to be that wage growth will not threaten china ’s competitiveness in the next ten or even 20 years . in any case , the chinese wage story is far more complicated than it might appear . even if real wages continue to rise in some coastal cities , “ surplus labor ” numbers could keep the national average flat . and even real wage increases on the national level wo n’t undermine china ’s competitiveness as long as labor productivity continues to grow more rapidly . either way , the chinese wage story is far more complicated than it might appear .
germany , europe ’s largest exporter , has a very large trade surplus with the rest of the world . to judge whether its prices are “ “ too high ” at the existing exchange rate , we must look to the us trade balance . germany ’s exports have exceeded its imports by almost $ 200 billion over the last twelve months , a surplus equivalent to almost 6 % of gdp . to judge whether their prices are “ too high ” at the existing exchange rate is to be seen by the us trade balance . because german exports have exceeded its imports by almost $ 200 billion in the last twelve months , a surplus equivalent to close to 6 % of gdp .
against this backdrop , it is easier to defend the status quo than to advocate for accommodation involving territorial concessions . netanyahu has conducted a campaign that has relied on his eloquence and charisma , as well as on scare tactics . these structural elements have been reinforced by developments throughout the region , which have reinforced a sense among israeli voters , owing to the threat of multiple enemies : iran and its nuclear ambitions ; hezbollah and hamas and its missiles ; the rise of isis amid state failure in iraq , syria , and elsewhere . in the weeks leading up to the election , the public seemed to have grown weary of a prime minister who was in office long enough to be corrupted by the arrogance of power , tainted by a raft of petty scandals . netanyahu , for his part , was clearly an impressive personal comeback .
throughout this process , kenya ’s leaders should bear in mind that even the best plans may occasionally go awry , as ghana ’s recent experience demonstrated . the following year , petroleum receipts management act split wealth among consumption , investment , and offshore saving , as recommended by economists around the world ( including the us ) . but , with the past year ’s presidential election , the situation began to deteriorate . four billion barrels of oil was discovered off ghana ’s shores in 2007 , and production started in 2010 . investment should thus be phased in , potentially implying temporary stores of some oil wealth abroad .
cambridge – back in 1997 , the united states and the united states treasury blamed the crisis on the lack of transparency on financial markets . since then , us hedge funds have grown in importance , and secret bank accounts have thrived . but when developing countries pointed their fingers at clandestine bank accounts and hedge funds , the imf and america ’s enthusiasm for greater transparency diminished . of course , most developing countries have been accumulating a vast foreign-currency reserves . but , with developing countries emphasizing fingers at covert bank accounts and hedge funds , the imf and us enthusiasm for greater transparency has diminished .
european policymakers have the tools and intelligence to maintain influence in ukraine . if they look to the ecb , they can find the right model for deploying them . in any case , the hardships suffered by eu citizens could be lessened if the eurozone followed draghi ’s eventual prescription , providing more fiscal and monetary stimulus in some areas designed to compensate for reform and fiscal consolidation in others . by selectively tackling its most perilous risks , draghi managed to minimize them . policymakers should do the same when it comes to eu sanctions against russia , mitigating their impact on those europeans who stand to suffer the most .
so , when sarah palin is escorted to the media limelight , she will become the symbolic revenge fantasy of many of those silenced , exhausted factory workers and secretaries . they perceive a working-class white woman being picked up to serve a heartbeat from an american president resonates powerfully with them . think of the appeal of movies like thelma and louise , or of a job girl in which a leader is a gutsy , exploited secretary who , the trampled by a snooty female ivy league boss , nonetheless manages to end up with her dream of the job , her dream guy , and corner office . so , when sarah palin is escorted into the media limelight , she will become the symbolic revenge fantasy of many of those silenced , exhausted factory workers , and corner offices . to see a working-class white woman being picked up to serve a heartbeat from an us president resonates powerfully with them .
that change will give china a far better opportunity to avoid the dreaded “ middle-income trap , ” which ensnared in most developing economies precisely because their policymakers mistakenly believed that a recipe for early-stage takeoff growth is sufficient to reach developed-country status . american and chinese cases do not exist in a vacuum . china has already delivered on that front by abandoning the growth model that has successfully driven the country ’s economic development for more than 30 years . it has recognized the need to shift from a model that has focused mainly on export-led – and investment-led production ( through manufacturing ) to one led by private consumption ( through services ) . as i emphasize in my new book the codependency of china and america ties them together .
hong kong – next month , policymakers , business leaders , academics , and civil-society representatives will meet in kiel , germany , for the global economic symposium ( ges ) to try to develop tangible solutions to today ’s most pressing economic issues . whether they yield effective proposals will depend on a comprehensive understanding of the factors underpinning – and undermining – financial stability globally . hong kong – next month , policymakers , business leaders , academics , and civil-society representatives will meet in kiel , germany , for the global economic symposium ( ges ) , where it will attempt to develop tangible solutions to today ’s most pressing economic problems . at last year ’s summit , central-banking dialogues on the future that pittsburgh presents as an inflation targeting against financial stability have produced three solutions : central banks should adopt a countercyclical policy approach ; the world monetary authority should be created to foster multilateral cooperation among central bank governors ; and price stability must remain the central bank ’s primary objective . while such solutions have some merit , they are inadequate to address effectively the complex and far-reaching flaws that led to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis .
piketty ’s framework stresses several drivers of this trend . for starters , by lowering trade and investment barriers , globalization has created an sort of winner-take-all environment in which the most technologically sophisticated actors have gained market share through economies of scale . notably , as the global economy moves toward knowledge-based value creation , few global branding innovators , high-technology , and creative industries win large , with a global tech boom augmenting their gains . the global financial system reinforces this concentration , with negative real interest rates promoting financial repression on household saving . the resulting concentration of revenues , wealth , and power undermines systemic stability by creating too-big-to-fail players while hampering smaller players ’ ability to compete .
but prevention must also address the dangers that potentially destabilizing capital movements pose . recent experience teaches that the speed and magnitude with which both domestic and foreign investors could move into and out of capital markets far exceeded that of individual countries — and of the international community — to counter such flows . all of this phenomenon teaches that the speed and magnitude with which both domestic and foreign investors can move into and out of capital markets far exceed that of individual countries — and of the international community as a whole — to counter such flows . sometimes these outflows can occur through no country ’s fault , but because of financial-market contagion that spreads from disturbances elsewhere . many countries lack foreign-currency reserves sufficient to meet sudden and large capital outflows without a destabilizing their domestic economies .
like courtiers who surround louis xviii , they have forgotten nothing and learned nothing . blair believes that britain ought to join the euro because it wants britain to be , as it puts it , “ at the heart of europe . ” that decision , in fact , is made virtually independently of prime minister tony blair , and even of his ambition . most commentators have tended to assume that if that is what tony blair wants , then sooner or later , that is what will happen , because , after all , he is prime minister after all . the only question now in doubt concerns whether brown ’s verdict on the euro will be “ not quite yet , ” not before the next election , “ at the heart of europe . ”
there was some backlash against trump when he failed to condemn an explicit white supremacist demonstrators in charlottesville , virginia , whose “ unification of the right [ rally ] to manipulate mass opinion and play on such repressed emotions as racism and class envy . ” the result of trump ’s approach is that america ’s existing problems worsen and vast opportunities are missed . and , even as they are stopped , can the damage that they have already wrought ? trump ’s rejection of “ reasoned discourse , ” including commitments of truth and evidence , ” has ” been compounded by the limitless , “ “ capacity ” to manipulate mass opinion , and are playing on such repressed emotions as racism and middle-class envy . but what can stop those demons has already unleashed ?
what is certain is that trump ’s ’s ’s ’s tax policies are fiscally sound . that might seem widely beneficial , but it would help only those at high enough tax brackets to itemize deductions , mostly households with annual revenue exceeding $ 75,000 ( the median american household income stood at $ 54,462 in 2015 ) . last but not least , trump has proposed tax deductions for the average cost of childcare . a question of whether trump ’s tax policies would benefit it directly remains unanswered , as they , unlike all other presidential candidates since richard nixon , refused to release his income-tax records . indeed , there is little indication of how any of his large tax policies would be funded , and any indication that they would sharply expand the us budget deficit .
entrepreneurs backed through the anzisha prize , for example , created more than 300 jobs and generated more than $ 850,000 in capital . and in south africa , marlon parker , the founder of the social-innovation academy and incubator ridges , has created a virtual currency , called zlato , in order to encourage active participation in skills-training workshops . since its inception in 2008 , rand has created tens of thousands of jobs , and is now active in more than 24 countries . africa ’s youngest entrepreneurs currently do not find ways to support themselves and contribute to their communities ; they solve the underlying cause of migration on – and off , the continent . when young people attend courses , access laptops , or book rooms at organizational cafés , they earn zlato credit that can be exchanged for food , medical care , and basic necessities .
but then , after all , scotland would demand its own strange arrangement vis-à-vis the eu , placing the uk in track for a major constitutional shakeup and perhaps dissolution . avoiding this scenario means sacrificing autonomy over eu trade policies over the form of the good friday agreement and its territorial integrity . british leaders need to recognize that all brexit scenarios involve tradeoffs , and the country urgently needs to hold domestic debate to the rank of the electorate ’s preferences . but this would upset hardline brexiteers , and might split the conservative party , at a risk that theresa may has been reluctant to take . the choice boils down to one of the three brexit scenarios and postpone the brexit process altogether .
there is undoubtedly a utilitarian aspect to the pravasi bharatiya divas celebrations as celebrations , as suggested by the many parallel seminars run by state governments in order to attract expatriate investment . the importance of diaspora financing , from working-class indians ’ remittances , which transformed kerala ’s countryside into high-tech enterprises in bangalore or gurgaon by silicon valley investors , simply can not be minimized , especially during the global financial crisis . the country also received $ 70 billion in remittances last year , more than double the level of inward foreign direct investment . but the us should not be doing away : overseas indians still invest a lower share of their gdp in india than overseas chinese do in china . encouraging them to do more , and giving them reason to do more , is certainly a worthwhile task for india ’s government , and the overt objective of its annual conclave .
firms that ignore the broader social and environmental context in which they operate are likely to pay a price : a reputational damage and loss of brand value , falling sales , difficulties of recruiting talent , lower-worker productivity , corruption , tougher government regulation , or climate-change-related increases . apple ’s ’s brand , for example , has recently been shaken out of revelations regarding brutal workplace conditions at foxconn factories in china , where most of its smartphones and ipads are assembled . companies that score poorly at risk of losing sales and investors , and triggering official regulatory or legal action . in response to concerns among customers , employees and shareholders , apple has improved their working conditions , agreeing to regular reviews by an independent observer . there are now cell-phone apps that evaluate and investors , and triggering official regulatory or regulatory action .
for example , the uptrend in saving in china started around parallel with its one-child policy was implemented in 1979 . the late nobel laureate economist franco modigliani argued in his recent major , highly published 2004 paper ( co-authored with shi larry cao ) argued that this demographic change explains much of an increase in saving , because chinese substituted investment in capital for infant investment . that prevented the birth rate from rebounding following the cultural revolution of 1966-76 . but income growth and demographics do not explain everything , either . moreover , they tolerate enterprise or government policies that encourage the high saving rate .
while the concept is modern , the idea is not new . in the 1930s , former us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes was flown to a head of franklin d. roosevelt , the fellow harvard graduate but one who was not a distinguished student . asked later about his impressions by a new president , holmes famously quipped : “ second-class intellect ; first-class temperament . ” practical people have long understood its importance in leadership . most historians would agree that roosevelt ’s achievement as a leader rested more on his emotional than his analytical iq .
ever since sudan won independence from the united kingdom in 1956 , the country has been convulsed by an almost constant north-south civil war based on a north-south cultural and religious divide . a separate but simultaneous vote in the oil-rich province of abyei will allow voters to choose whether they would seek to join the north or the south . the artificial fusion of primarily arab , the muslim north of sudan , and the african south , where christianity and its traditional animist convictions are predominant , has been an abject failure . matters were subsequently complicated by a separate conflict – this time among muslims – over resources in the western darfur region . if the non-muslim south achieved at independence a huge degree of religious , cultural , and governance autonomy within a decentralized federal structure , it is inconceivable that the country might remain in peace .
being responsive to member states ’ concerns and priorities was right and normal ; taking the orders from them was not . when i was the undp ’s administrator , i had to contend with constant “ requests ” by government representatives . typically , they were formulated in an acceptable way , asking me to “ look into ” a particular topic . but i , too , received requests , often from the global superpowers , in ways that were at once in clear violation of article 100 of the un charter , and in which i was forced to spend a great deal of time trying to avoid engaging with governments on such terms . nonetheless , my full experience at the undp and the world bank suggested that us staff and management could and should behave according to article 100 .
blackrock , the world ’s largest fund manager , has lost around $ 90 billion over the past decade , three-quarters of it attributable to its holdings in exxonmobil , chevron , shell , and bp . and investors in general electric , including blackrock , lost a whopping $ 193 billion in the three years leading up to 2018 , as the company has misjudged the pace of the green energy shift and the collapse of demands for gas turbines and thermal power stations . more broadly , the investor agenda for the low-carbon world has attracted 477 signatories , representing some $ 34 trillion in governance assets . these investors are urging governments not only to rein in rising temperatures , but also to meet the paris climate agreement ’s tougher goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels . meanwhile , the bill for energy economics and financial analyses has found that those who have ignored climate-change warnings have already taken a financial hit .
conflict with the united states , if anything , is unlikely on this point . but trouble with america ’s asian allies , especially japan , could draw the american in a fight that it wants strongly to avoid . in short , china is on the precipice of large , necessary , and dangerous transitions that promises to change the country in the better off or make everything , including regional stability , much worse . the whole world has a big stake in what happens next . at such a soft time internally , china would gain nothing from antagonizing america .
south africa adopted the freedom of information law in 2000 , five years earlier than the united kingdom had done . now , however , the right to information in south africa is in jeopardy . in late november , the lower house of parliament , headed by the majority african national congress ( anc ) , the outspoken new law , “ protection of the state ’s information bill , ” whose adoption would shield the country ’s most-powerful political power and business elites from public scrutiny . south africa adopted the freedom of information law in the 2000 ’s , five years ahead of the united kingdom . south africa now adopted the post-apartheid novelist and anti-apartheid activist nadine gordimer likened the bill to that of apartheid legislation .
washington , dc – the chinese economy has slowed in recent years , but remains a potent performer , contributing some one-third of total economic growth worldwide . it is also becoming more sustainable , in line with the shift in its growth model away from investment and exports , and toward domestic demand and services . above all , domestic credit continues to expand at an unsustainable pace , with corporate debt accumulating to dangerous levels . in the run-up to next month ’s g20 summit in hangzhou , china , has been calling loudly for new commitments to structural reforms to stimulate growth in advanced and emerging-market economies . but , at home , china now faces significant risks .
hong kong – at the beginning of this century , when china initiated its “ go out ” foreign policy , focused on exploiting foreign-exchange reserves to support overseas expansion and acquisitions by chinese companies , few had expected that the country would quickly emerge as a leading economic player in latin america . yet that , too , is precisely what has gone wrong in recent years . in less than 15 years , china has gone from playing the rather peripheral economic role in latin america to becoming one of the region ’s top investors and trading partners for most of the region ’s countries , as well as its foremost lender and infrastructure builder . with its economic plans in latin america cruising along seamlessly , a trend that seems unlikely to be changing anytime soon , china has now set its sights on another goal : expanding its political influence within and outside the region . the question is whether that is good for latin america .
in remarks following the press conference in may , he praised trump as “ a very colorful , talented person ” and the “ absolute leader of the presidential race . ” again , the two men are consummate propagandists and the performers . and both are ready – even longing to bully , harangue , and lie to get ahead . there is little question about which america ’s presidential candidate , putin , should be seen within the white house . the two men are consummate propagandists and the performers .
in practice , this would mean implementing policies to assist the middle class , while updating an obsolete center-left program to account for the consequences of disruptive technologies and business models . the first was to adopt the middle right ’s agenda and pursue labor-market , fiscal , and investment policies to “ adapt ” ” france to “ capitalist ” globalization . the other avenue would require macron to build on a pre-existing but vague conception of left-wing internationalism . as the development economist dani rodrik has long argued , more globalization requires a greater state , so to compensate those displaced by free trade , capital-account liberalization , and so forth . somewhat surprisingly , this is a route he initially chose , quickly becomes the darling of a nationalistic oriented international press .
“ why are we looking to the federal government to try and fix our local problems ? ” in a vindictive scenario , people would club together in various states based on their preferences of big or small government , public or private service delivery , and international cooperation or isolationism . in a vindictive scenario , by contrast , trump and the us congress might seek to limit the rights of progressive states . mick mulvaney , trump ’s budget director , has also made the case . “ if you live in a state that wishes to mandate maternity coverage for everybody , including 60-year-old women , that fine , ” and , if you do n’t , “ then you can devise ways to change the state that you live in ” or to change “ “ state legislatures and state ” laws , ” ” ” in mulvaney of the phrase .
whereas 22 % of south korea ’s energy needs and 14 % of taiwan ’s gdp are met by nuclear , those ratios are now set to drop dramatically . moreover , they will pave the way for increased investment in the renewable-power grid , by placing their countries in a new and competitive footing in the regional marketplace . south korea ’s strategy calls for a gradual exit from the nuclear industry , through the non-renewal of existing licenses and prohibitions in future plants . for years , overreliance on traditional fuels has deterred energy-generation investment , through the non-renewal of existing licenses and bans on future plant plants . blueprints remains formulated , but has taken together both countries ’ commitments mark the main shift in regional energy planning toward greener , cleaner technologies .
because the dollar is the dominant global reserve currency , and america ’s fed controls the supply of american dollars as long as china sticks to the fixed exchange rate , it can not control its own money supplies . a floating currency is inevitable as china liberalizes its capital market and eliminates restrictions on international capital movements ; either way , china would have to cede control over its money supply and interest rates to america ’s base . yet china ’s rulers are right to postpone a decision to float . because the us dollar is the dominant global reserve currency and the fed can not hide its fundamental economic law : if the two countries ’ exchange rates are fixed and capital flows between them are unrestricted , the economically dominant us will exercise control over one another ’s monetary policy . a floating currency is inevitable as china liberalizes its capital market and eliminates the restrictions of international capital movements ; either china would have to cede control over its money supply and america ’s interest rates .
as the paris accord recognizes , many scientists believe that warming above 1.5 ºc is risky , and that adaptation will be extremely expensive , especially for developing countries and the island of member states . in reality , even that level might not be low enough . can we turn the tap to zero net emissions in the long run before the bathwater hits a level that takes us well over the 2ºc threshold , established in paris ? so we are in a race to this point . as the paris agreement recognizes , many scientists believe that warming above 1.5 ºc is risky , and that adaptation will be exceptionally expensive , especially for developing countries and the island of the member states .
mind you ; citizens of the west are blessed with a living in an era of peaceful coexistence : changing circumstances and priorities can be resolved through the democratic process in place of foreign and civil wars . for i am afraid that this can not be an extremely well picture . indeed , no one possesses any clue as to the consequences , both for the uk as part of the global trading system or its effect on domestic political stability . but what , exactly , is a fairly fair democratic process for making irreversible , empowered , national-defining choices ? is this really enough to cause 52 % to vote for a rainy day ?
so one would expect the smaller countries to spend proportionally more on defense than larger ones . but confining discussion of a defense commitment to the 10 % of gdp spent by the army is insufficient , because there are economies of scale in defense spending . indeed , defense spending amounts to 1.6 % of gdp in germany , 2 % in italy , and 1.5 % in spain ; only france and the united kingdom will reach 3 % . security and global influence are not the only advantages that come through military spending . instead , america alone spends more than the majority of its nato allies combined ; and defense spending in the us is likely to increase even more in the years that can come .
new york – at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly earlier this month , a widespread sense of foreboding fell apart among world leaders . in the late 1960s , former us secretary of state dean acheson looked back at the immediate postwar era , and felt like he was present at the birth of a new world based on shared rules and multilateral institutions . in the unga that year , however , many attendees felt as though they were present in the destruction of that world . even before the summit began , europeans , canadians , mexicans , southern koreans , and japan convened in earnest about the need for a new alliance to save the multilateral system . anxieties went well beyond standard concerns about what us president donald trump would say to do or tweet .
as events over the last two weeks in egypt have demonstrated all too vividly , the arab awakening still plays only in its first acting in many countries . indeed , it is democracy , at best , appears across the headlines , throughout north africa ; and , elsewhere in the middle east , jordan , palestinian lands , kuwait , and saudi arabia have only just begun to feel the ripple ples of a tidal wave sweeping the region . yet bahrain remains a flashpoint ; iraq is deeply unstable ; and , in the middle east , jordan , palestinian lands , kuwait , and saudi arabia have only just begun to feel the waves of a tidal wave sweeping the region . over the medium term , the world is witnessing the tensions and potential crises that america ’s leadership is likely to become indispensable to resolving . bahrain remains a flashpoint ; iraq is deeply unstable ; and the simmering conflict between iran and israel might flare up anytime soon .
the impact of this lost european perspective became starkly apparent during the fall of 2008 , when , in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of lehman brothers , german chancellor angela merkel ’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-european . so these new leaders envision europe simply as a trading regime . meanwhile , germany ’s diplomacy is actively reinventing the country of an economic and cultural sphere of influence , and not only in eastern europe . in today ’s germany , because no one with resolute powers in business , finance , or experienced by the government in wartime , the european project is no longer perceived as conditioning europe ’s collective future . there would not have been a common european roadmap for managing the crisis , and no call for public money .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . such shortcomings are particularly apparent in poland , where a highly centralized political system creates a pernicious winner-take-all dynamic . focused killing by the united states by one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
on the surface , a “ united economic space ” sounds like something to applaud . when is a free-trade agreement , a free-trade agreement is bad ? when is the underlying purpose – to call for a “ united economic space ” – is now entering russia , ukraine , kazakhstan , and belarus . on the surface , a “ united economic space ” sounds like something to applaud . but , sad , the treaty will simply entrench postcommunism ’s corrupt and criminal enterprise practices , not increase trade or prosperity .
nahda ’s ascent ( renaissance ) , the prominent islamist party , is less a reflection of latent ideological support among a newly liberated population than it is testament to the party ’s spectacular capacity to fill the post-revolutionary political vacuum . scores of volunteers are deployed at electoral campaigning at a door-to-door grassroots , door-to-door level . while opponents ominously recall the complicity of party cadres in the deadly bombing of the tourist targets in 1991 , the nahda has gone to some lengths to appease its critics . the party ’s imposing headquarters in the tunis suburbs will be less a reflection of latent ideological support among the newly liberated population than it is testament to the party ’s remarkable ability to fill the post-revolutionary political vacuum .
consider first the assertion that the us dollar ’s status as a reserve currency protects it because governments around the world needed to hold dollars as foreign-exchange reserves . the trouble is that the foreign holdings of us dollar securities are no longer primarily “ foreign-exchange reserves ” in the traditional sense . in earlier decades , countries held dollars because they needed a highly liquid and widely accepted currency to bridge the financing gap if their imports exceeded their exports . but , starting in the late 1990 ’s , countries like south korea , taiwan , and singapore accumulated very large volumes of foreign reserves , reflecting both export-driven growth strategies and a desire to avoid a repeat of the speculative currency attacks triggered by the 1997-1998 asian financial crisis . the obvious candidate for this reserve fund was us treasury bills .
it is extremely difficult for liberals to accept that bad politics can produce good economics , and that good politics can produce bad economics . under prime minister viktor orbán , the country has become increasingly authoritarian . good economics , on the other hand , recognizes a government ’s duty to protect its constituents against distress , insecurity , and calamity . it ’s extremely difficult for liberals to accept that bad politics can produce good economics , and that good politics can produce bad economics . and yet hungary provides a stark example .
new york – the davos world economic forum ranks food insecurity as major risks to humankind . the united nations food and agriculture organization argues that rising food prices could result in increasing global conflicts . un secretary ban ki-moon has created a working group to devise a common plan of action , and france , ’s president nicolas sarkozy , has proposed the global partnership for food . the world bank has forcefully emphasized the importance of agriculture to jump-starting economic expansion and to breaking the cycle of poverty . countries and organizations are already mobilizing , and the un and other members can not meet the trend .
so , why are investors holding such assets ? many long-term investors , like insurance companies and pension funds , have no alternative , because they are obliged to hold safer bonds . but , given such investors ’ long-term liabilities ( claims and advantages ) , their mandates are to invest mostly in bonds that are riskier than stocks or other volatile assets . to be sure , negative returns make their balance sheets shakier : a defined-benefit pension plan requires positive returns to break even , and when most of its assets yield negative nominal returns , such outcomes become more difficult to accomplish . but negative returns are also happening in countries and regions where the currency is depreciating and likely to depreciate further , including germany , other parts of the eurozone core , and japan .
with polls indicating that about 70 % of french support for the yellow vest protesters , macron has been forced to retreat . in his first year and a half in office , macron has begun to tackle these problems , and has managed to provide a budget in line with eu deficit rules . the problem is that in pursuing these reforms , macron has abandoned his core , center-left constituency . and so , when he was announced that his government will raise taxes on diesel fuel , middle up – and working-class commuters took to the streets . by marching continuing to do so , his reforms seemed consistently to benefit the wealthy .
some also argue that the global elite has squandered their influence over the international system by intervening politically and militarily in the affairs of others , without a clear endgame . a growing backlash against international cooperation has appeared to be underway in recent years , rooted partly in fear , stoked by populist political leaders in many countries , that supranational “ elites ” are attempting to impose “ globalism ” : an “ ideology that prioritizes the neoliberal global order over national interests . ” as it stands , perhaps the greatest barriers to international cooperation are political . some have also argue that the global elite have squandered their influence over the international system by intervening politically and militarily in the economic affairs of others , without a clear endgame . but perspectives that legitimate this narrative seem to be gaining ground .
by propping up inflation , the fed would reverse the real interest rates seriously , thereby coercing thrifty households into spending rather than saving . first , while low rates might stimulate spending if credit were easy , it is not at all clear that traditional savers today would go out and spend . with rising demand , firms would hire and all do well . this is an alternative from the one that calls for inflation as the way to reduce long-term debt ( at the expense of investors ) , but has equally profound weaknesses . think of the soon-to-retire office worker .
for the first year after gleneagles ’ meeting , the numbers were padded with misleading accounting regarding debt cancellation operations . specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , total aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , had risen by a meager 2 % . the g-8 is now reaping the consequences of its inaction . with those debt cancellation operations largely finalized , data are now revealing the stark truth : development aid to africa and to poor countries more generally is stagnant just as much as it was promised . for the first year after gleneagles met , the numbers were padded by misleading accounting about debt cancellation operations .
but that is not really what the average citizen sees . perhaps the biggest grievances of the last year have been inequality . according to the european bank for reconstruction and development , ’s new transition report , based on the 2015-2016 life in a transition survey produced by the world bank and the ebrd ( where i was the chief economist ) , perceived rising inequality far exceeded the reality described by official data , typically relying on household surveys . on the global level , however , inequality has come down . and while inequality has been on the rise within some advanced economies , the increase has not been particularly dramatic , and remains at reasonable levels .
washington , dc – the united states federal reserve system is one of the world ’s most powerful anti-drug organizations . that is an alarming result , because top fed officials seem likely to have slid back into their pre-2008 ways , ignoring concerns about dangerous financial-sector behavior – even when such concerns are voiced by members of america ’s senate banking committee . and , although the fed may have been partly responsible for the regulatory failures that led to the global economy ’s ’s near-meltdown in 2008-2009 , post-crisis reform has left it with an even bigger authority and more accountable to overseeing the financial system . america ’s central bank has control over the supply of dollars , and currently exerts large sway over interest rates , for both short - and long-term borrowing . that ’s an alarming outcome , because senior fed officials seem to have slid back into their pre-2008 ways , ignoring concerns about dangerous financial-sector behavior – even as those concerns are voiced by members of america ’s senate banking committee .
at this stage , however , the us is still largely treading on terra incognita . as a result , scientists and engineers face a daunting task during the anthropocene era : to steer the us toward environmentally sustainable governance . that will require sound human behavior at all levels , and it may well involve engage internationally accepted , large-scale geo-engineering projects to “ optimize the climate . ” unless a global catastrophe is happening , a meteorite impact , a world war , or a pandemic , mankind will remain an important environmental force for many millennia . more by fortunate than by narrow wisdom , this catastrophic situation has not developed .
in all of these cases , a cynic might be half-right . constitutional change is for political leaders as a welcome distraction from the much more change-resistant economic-policy issues . but there are no less than two exceptions to this line of suspicion , either . one is the creation of democracy and the rule of law in countries most recently emerged from the end of the dictatorship . the process requires the constitution making an often intricate and painful kind .
that is undermining corporate profitability , spurring companies to deleverage and reduce investment , and fueling further declines in ppi . the enduring importance of real-estate investment to china ’s economic-growth reflects trends from the first quarter of this year . and it has been fueled partly by unforeseen rises in real-estate investment , to as much as 6 % . none of this is to say that what china needs is more real-estate investment . after all , the enduring importance of real-estate investment to china is reflected in trends from the first quarter of this year .
but this does not mean that trump skeptics can just sit back and wait out for it to be proven wrong , because it is plausible to do so even in the us during the first year that the reported trade deficit will narrow , even as the true us trade deficit widens . on value-added terms , a patent makes the largest contribution . it all comes down to a “ transfer pricing ” in the us , prices multinational corporations are using to lay a value on cross-border trade in inputs among their subsidiaries . consider the american pharmaceutical industry , which is setting up a plant in iran . iceland ’s affiliate imports some inputs ( most notably a publicly-represented intellectual property ) , assembles this product in iran , and exports it back to the us .
if countries like south africa are ever to escape republican administrations ’ attack on reproductive freedom , new strategies are needed to fight the global gag rule . past recommendations included increasing affordable transportation to family-planning facilities ; broadening access to modern contraception ( including emergency contraception ) ; increasing sex education availability ; and developing strategies for reducing abortion ’s stigma . and yet , as a result of us policy , none of these changes will come easily . if countries like south africa are ever to escape republican administrations ’ assault on reproductive freedom , new strategies are needed to combat the global gag rule . regulations included increasing affordable transportation to family-planning facilities ; broadening access to modern contraception ( including emergency contraception ) ; increasing sex education availability ; and developing strategies to reduce abortion services ’ stigma .
we want tech firms to play a central role in providing fresh ideas and disruptive thinking . it was gandhi ’s belief that reflection could motivate action by recalibrating our moral compass . it has been gandhi ’s faith that reflection could motivate action by recalibrating our moral compass . what makes this fund unique is not the plethora of new benchmarks it sets . we want firms that already offer refugees an online learning board , the internet access , and the hardware of directing learning to displaced and isolated girls and boys .
but , since the parliamentary election in october , ukraine has started to pull itself together . debate over the association agreement with the european union , together with a russian-backed rebellion in the far east , has withstood tensions over distinctions that have previously played little or no part in people ’s lives . russia ’s intervention has to some extent backfired , reinforcing support for a european orientation . eastern ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country , but an overwhelming majority of voters have emerged in turmoil . russia ’s interference has to some extent backfired , enhancing support for a european orientation .
the top priority for the european central bank must be to preserve the integrity of the eu ’s banking union , under pressure from both brexit and the crisis gripping italy ’s banks . the bank for international settlements has ’ new general manager , agustín carstens , a former central bank governor of mexico , will have a pivotal role to play , as will whoever replaces mark carney ( the current governor of the bank of england ) next year as chairman of the fsb . it is also likely that a new chair of the basel committee will soon emerge itself . the top priority for the european central bank must be to preserve the integrity of the eu ’s banking union , under pressure from both brexit and the crisis gripping italy ’s banks . against this backdrop , the challenge will be to retain the primacy of global norms , and to secure a continuing buy-in within the basel process .
clearly , international regulatory gaps have created spillover effects for banks that operate globally have been absent . the crisis resolution mechanisms for banks that operate globally have been absent . supervision , greater transparency in financial markets , the effective early-warning system for financial crises , and better international policy coordination . moreover , international regulatory gaps have created spillover effects for banks that operate globally have been absent . clearly , international regulatory gaps in regulation have been in need .
in fact , america ’s extraterritorial sanctions are not a credible , long-term threat . trade with iran can easily be denominated in euros , the renminbi , rupee , and rubles , avoiding american banks . in fact , america ’s extraterritorial sanctions are not a credible , long-term threat . trade with iran can easily be denominated in euros , the renminbi , rupee , and rubles , avoiding american banks . trade with iran can easily be denominated in euros , the renminbi , rupee , and rubles , avoiding american banks .
countries would be well advised to avoid including pari passu clauses in prospective debt contracts , to say the least , without establishing more fully what was intended . such treaties should also include collective-action clauses making it all impossible for vulture funds to hold down debt restructuring . but so , too , is the court ’s rulings , which have evidently assigned little weight to their arguments . when a sufficient share of creditors agreed to a restructuring plan ( in argentina ’s case , holders of more than 90 % of the country ’s gdp did ) , the rest may be forced to go along . the fact that the international monetary fund , the american people ’s bank of justice , and anti-poverty ngos all joined in opposing even more complete what was intended .
as america ’s recent semiannual report to america ’s congress has noted , for china these plans are “ to rebalance its economy : to bolster domestic demand and the consumption-led growth rate ; to reform its financial system ; and to achieve more flexibility in its exchange-rate regime . but expanding demand and allowing for real , effective exchange-rate appreciation in china will not be enough if other countries do their part . indeed , rebalancing the growth pattern is the central economic goal of china ’s leadership . oil exporters must boost fiscal spending further ; japan and europe must unleash higher growth through structural reforms ; and the us must implement concrete measures to sustain higher savings . knowing what to do in this increasingly complex and volatile situation is the easy part : look at multilateral consultation policy plans , and “ do it just . ”
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . washington , dc , has been the ultimate measure of an economy ’s well-being for more than 80 years . yet , as the world ’s economies become increasingly intricate and technology-focused , economists are increasingly questioning gdp ’s usefulness as estimating an economy ’s health , with some arguing for a radically new approach . africa ’s experience shows why such an approach is badly needed .
do n’t get me wrong : despite its imperfections , america remains a positive power globally . indeed , it may well be the only strongly positive power alongside the european union , which should stop squabbling and start curtailing megalomaniacal and illiberal leaders like hungary ’s putin-infatuated prime minister , viktor orbán . the notion that he should not take steps to protect his interests is ideological partiality disguised as objectivity , and lends credence to putin ’s claims that the west is out to gain him . moreover , the prospect that their new president is in putin ’s pockets certainly should be alarming for america . and the west ’s policies toward russia , economic sanctions or military exercises at border countries like poland are not necessarily mistaken .
fortunately , there are encouraging signs that the commitment will be revered . according to the oecd and the un climate policy initiative , developed countries have collectively mobilized $ 52.2 billion in 2013 , and $ 61.8 billion , in 2014 , to help poor countries reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions and build resilience against the consequences of climate change that they can no longer avoid . but there is also a need for broader funding flows , particularly from the private sector . if one assumes greater leverage for private-sector investment , the figure would be higher . while it is important to note that figure is a mere guess , it represents a putative , credible indicator of climate finance based on disinformation made by developed countries .
first among such sources of uncertainty are the global economy : will volatility and imbalances lead to meltdown , or will enhanced multipolarity underpin more resilience ? and that leads to another , potentially game-changing issue : whether regional instability remains contained or fuels global insecurity . moreover , while interstate conflict has been unfolding , intrastate confrontation , driven by a youthful population , identity politics , and low resources will continue to plague some regions , like the middle east , south asia , and afghanistan . and that leads to another , potentially game-changing issue : whether regional instability remains contained or fuels global insecurity . then there is the space for questions about the impact of new technologies .
if the bush administration sought stable , secure , diverse , and low-grade oil supply , it could have simply lifted its embargos on libya , iran , iraq , and sudan , and let the saudi oil gush . the great irony here , though , is that america has exercised greater control over the iraqi oil sector as part of the un ’s pre-war “ oil-for-food program ” ( in which the un , not saddam hussein , has fixed the level of iraqi oil sales abroad ) than it will in any future democratic iraq . the bush administration recognized that , above all , iraqi crude oil represents a critical geopolitical asset . but america ’s interest in iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or by energy policy . so , whoever controls iraqi oil controls iraq .
but challengers like china and india are in no position to preach . to be sure , income inequality and social injustice are the concomitant of the western-type capitalist culture . moreover , although china is becoming the world ’s largest economy in , say , 2018 , americans would still be far richer than the chinese , with per capita gdp in america four times that of china . hundreds of millions of oligarchs in india hold assets equivalent to 25 % of gdp , whereas some 800 million of their compatriots survive on less than a dollar a day . to be sure , income inequality and social injustice are the concomitant of a western-style capitalist culture .
from this perspective , the shortcoming of america ’s income-tax system is that marginal tax rates are high at the bottom ( owing to means tests of welfare programs ) and the top ( owing to the graduated-rate structure of the rich ) . thus , the us government has moved in the wrong direction since 2009 , sharply raising marginal tax rates at the bottom ( owing to dramatically increasing transfer programs ) and , more recently , at the top ( owing to the graduated-rate structures of the rich ) . accordingly , cutting the payroll tax rate in 2011-2012 , making rates more graduating ( on the medicare side ) have been mistakes out of standpoint by standpoint efficient taxation . one of the most energy-efficient tax-raising methods is america ’s payroll tax for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate ( because of the deductions for welfare programs ) and , more recently , at the top ( owing to the graduated-rate structure of the rich ) . typically , that principle implies that marginal tax rates should be similar at various levels of labor income , for various kinds of consumption , for outlays today versus tomorrow , and so on .
for many developing countries , high oil and food prices represent a triple threat : not only are importing countries forced to pay more for grains , they must pay more for their countries , and still more for delivery to consumers that may live a long distance from their ports . for many developing countries , high oil and food prices represent a triple threat : not only are importing countries forced to pay more for their grains , they must pay more for their countries , and will continue to provide it to consumers who may live a long distance from their ports . so long as developing countries remain integrated into the global economy , and do not take measures to restrain the impact of international prices on home prices , home prices in rice and other grains are bound to rise markedly when international prices do . but unless global energy and food prices return at intolerable levels , such measures by themselves can not bring inflation down to targeted levels . for many developing countries , high oil and food prices represent a triple threat : not only importing countries must pay more for their grains and services , especially non-traded goods and services .
the important points for them are that they gained a vengeance by inflicting harm , had shown themselves to be real men , did not buckle under , and survived it . the leaders who brought on failure , and groups that did not triumph , are likely to argue that they were courageously fought an enemy , without being crushed in the face . yet defeats are not forcing new attitudes , policies , or leaders . such a pattern is a formula for never-ending conflict and a interminable defeat . thus , they do not formally give up anything at all .
though america in 2017 is deeply divided , americans remain committed to their central tenets of democracy : free , fair and regular elections and the protection of political , religious , and economic liberty . fearful pronouncements about a incipient ( or actual ) rise are misplaced . when they leave office , america essentially comes to whatever it was after it entered it : the world ’s most powerful democracy . it is unlikely that trump will attempt to overturn any one of these things ; and , even if it tries , it will fail . fearful pronouncements about a incipient ( or actual ) fascism ’s rise are misplaced .
certain very professional organizations emphasize the need to acquire patient consent , even if tissue has already been dropped out of the patient ’s body . who , after all , should have access to those samples ? today , there are brain tissue banks , the breast tissue banks , the blood banks , the umbilical cord banks , dna banks , and the tissue repositories for the study of a wide variety of diseases . virtually all of us have tissues on the file . who , then , should have access to these samples ?
in turn , potential leaders can learn more about the sources and limits of the soft-power skills of emotional iq skills , vision and communication , as well as hard-power political and organizational capabilities . they also need to understand better the nature of contextual intelligence that they will have to educate their hunches and sustain smart-power strategies . in turn , potential leaders can learn more about the sources and limits of the soft-power skills of emotional iq skills , vision , and communication , as well as hard-power political and organizational capabilities . with soft power , however , the power of empowered followers strengthens leaders . leadership is broadly distributed throughout healthy democracies , and all citizens need to learn more about what makes good and bad leaders .
that deal was intended to set the stage for the independence referendum in western sahara the following year , a democratic resolution . at the same time , morocco has repeatedly obstructed progress toward further negotiations . it did so in defiance of the un security council , even going so far as to bar the un ’s special envoy from traveling to the region in order to set the stage for the talks . in return , morocco has also repeatedly blocked progress toward further negotiations . the us polisario front has fought a war with morocco until 1991 , when the un brokered a ceasefire agreement .
moreover , the two candidates embody continuity , with chirac the gaullist side to sarkozy , as well as françois mitterrand at the heart of the royal party , as much as a rupture . royal openly asserts mitterand ’s legacy as she struggles to win for legitimacy , whereas sarkozy ’s rejection of chirac ’s legacy has more to do with form than with substance . moreover , the two candidates embody continuity , with chirac the gaullist side to sarkozy and françois mitterrand on the type of royal just like the rupture . to a big extent , sarkozy can be seen as chirac with more , whereas royal is manifestly mitterrand with less fear . in the spring of 2007 , their choice may well depend more on negative than positive considerations , as he did in 2002 , when chirac was confronting the odious nationalist jean-marie le pen in the second round .
but china ’s recent shift away from muscle-flexing , and its confluence of us-led interests , offer hope that it will not fuel large-scale regional instability later this year . true , china has withdrew its jumbo oil platform from the waters of the disputed paracel islands last july , sending surveillance vessels to the senkaku islands less frequently . chinese officials have also become more willing to discuss forming a code of conduct for the south china sea . with obama unwilling or unable , owing to rising political partisanship at home , taking the lead in resolving crises , like those in egypt , libya , and syria , challengers to america ’s supremacy took heart in 2014 , and america ’s allies took the fright . chinese officials have also become more willing to discuss forming a code of conduct for the south china sea .
labor-force participation in america has fallen to levels not seen since women began entering the labor market in large numbers . yes , the us has done some things to refine its financial markets . labor-force participation in america has fallen to levels not seen since women began entering the labor market in large numbers . there have been some increases in capital requirements , but far short of what is needed . yes , the us has done some things to improve financial markets .
new york – american politics , not global developments , will be the main determinant of it . whether or not america will continue to lead the world remains unclear . the republican presidential campaign adds another element of uncertainty . the two leading opposition candidates to the party nomination , donald trump , and nobel laureate ted cruz , both say that they will tear up the iran nuclear deal if elected . it ’s worth recalling the result of president george w. bush ’s analogous decision to tear up bill clinton ’s “ framework agreement ” on north korea : the kim regime promptly and predictably developed the nuclear bomb .
president vladimir voronin subsequently gave an amnesty to detainees . likewise , stability matters because the country ’s borders on romania , a member state of the european union . nonetheless , many remain in detention and voronin continue to hurl accusations at the opposition and romania of organizing a coup d’état . to restore stability and a fair democratic system to moldova , legal processes have been important , first and foremost , because moldovans deserve a government that is being held in charge . stability is also important because the country ’s borders with romania , a member state of the european union .
on the eve of their depression , a few arab autocrats actually laud the world bank and the international monetary fund for their supposed success in adopting the sound of economic policies . for their part , were economists who focused the wrong indicators ? were they misled by false inferences ? the world bank , subsequent mea culpa , also a clear indication that policies may have been trouble in the minds of arab ancien régimes . more precisely , that raises a raft of other questions .
but rmb internationalization encourages non-residents to hold more rmbs and rmb-denominated assets . a key goal of china ’s capital controls is to prevent non-resident lenders to hold domestic rmb-denominated assets that are unrelated to trade and long-term capital inflows . so , as for rmb internationalization , rmb deposits held by hong kong residents have reached rmb370 trillion ( $ 57 trillion ) , and the amounts may reach rmb1 trillion by the end of the year . so the controls are leaky , to be sure but function ( so far ) , thereby keeping china ’s policy of maintaining macroeconomic stability in the years ahead . as a result of rmb internationalization , rmb deposits held by hong kong residents have reached rmb370 trillion ( $ 57 trillion ) and the amount could reach rmb1 trillion by the end of the year .
the nineteenth-century prussian military officer and theorist carl von clausewitz spoke presciently of an age of total war that would have been reached less than a century after his death . trump does n’t just want to avoid repeating past failed policies , as he puts it . but things are more than they are , for that matter , than they are . the nineteenth-century prussian military officer and theorist carl von clausewitz spoke presciently of an age of total war that would come less than a century after his death . he and his supporters have also taken aim at the fundamental institutions upon which american democracy rests , including courts , legislative branches , independent media , and more .
the european central bank has acted decisively to prop up european banks ; now it needs to support the real economy , too . while official interest rates remain just 1 % , solvent sovereigns like spain pay more than 5 % to borrow for ten years , while creditworthy firms in italy can borrow only at punitive rates if they do . instead , the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports to economies at a current-account deficit , like france , italy , and spain ( as well as the united kingdom ) , and stimulating consumption in surplus countries like germany and the netherlands . so the ecb should do more to block the monetary-policy transmission mechanism ; europe ’s banking authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9 % ratio ; and where necessary , national governments should make guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size enterprises . in short , on its own , structural reform can not be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012 .
during prime minister aznar ’s first term , his popular party privatized most public-sector firms and made a deregulated many service industries . his new government vows to continue eliminating public-sector deficits and reducing unemployment . at the same time , it promises to cut income taxes , put the country in a social security system on firmer footing , and lower the cost of shedding labor . aznar ’s agenda is a sensible still ambitious goal . introducing real competition in energy and telecoms , lacking in the privatization process , is also pledged .
cambridge : the internet now pervades each region of business life anywhere ; trump ’s in business activity over internet astounds . as recently as january 1995 , some 27,000 online business addresses were put on hold . in 1998 , an important new report by america ’s department of commerce , mostly americans , used the internet . by 1994 , an estimated 27,000 online business addresses were identified . an important new report by america ’s department of commerce , “ the emerging digital economy ” indicates that the internet is reshaping not only american business , but the world economy .
there is no reliable scientific evidence that gm foods cause illness , despite their receiving far more intensive scrutiny than more “ natural ” foods . ( natural foods can also create health risks , as was recently shown by studies that a popular type of cinnamon can cause liver damage . ( natural foods , too , can create health risks , as was shown recently by the introduction of studies that a popular type of cinnamon can cause liver damage . ) regulations to preserve the environment and consumer health must be maintained . we should be pleased about this – and perhaps the regulations introduced in response to the concerns expressed by environmental organizations have played a role in this outcome .
unfortunately , yet another lesson of the financial crisis is that most policymakers are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize . we are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred , and governments are becoming vigilant . to be sure , virus protection and virus development represent an uneven arms race . let us hope that we are lucky for some time to come . a virus can be just a few hundred computer code lines , in comparison to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs that must be designed to detect wide classrooms .
furthermore , each dollar invested through this initiative would produce almost $ 50 in returns , thereby making it an exceptionally efficient use of scarce resources . these impressive figures have emerged from a comprehensive analysis conducted by a team of top economists tasked by my think tank , the copenhagen consensus center , with assessing possible population-related targets to identify the best global investment possible . those migrant laborers ’ taxes would help the developed world fund services for the elderly , and their remittances would help their home countries . these impressive figures have emerged from a comprehensive analysis conducted by a team of top economists tasked with my think tank , the copenhagen consensus center , with assessing possible population-related targets to identify the best global investment possible . moreover , every dollar invested in this initiative would produce almost $ 50 in returns , making it exceptionally efficient use of scarce resources .
wellington – paracetamol ( known as acetaminophen in the united states ) , is one of the most widely used drugs in the world . it is the preferred medications for relieving fever and pain , owing to its safety profile ; but ten years ago , the hypothesis was naturally conceived that using paracetamol can increase the risk of developing asthma treatment . it is the preferred medications for relieving fever and pain , owing to its safety profile ; but ten years ago , the paracetamol use can increase the risk of developing asthma development . such studies have led to the suggestion that the use of paracetamol can represent an important risk factor in childhood asthma and other allergic disorders . the substitution of paracetamol paracetamol for aspirin , the researchers proposed , may have led to an allergic immune response , thereby increasing susceptibility to asthma and other allergic disorders .
“ south africa is the jewel of african astronomy , ” ” says charles mcgruder , a professor in the ministry of physics and astronomy at west kentucky university . mcgruder , working closely with african astronomers , agrees that a space program for the region is critical to raising the profile of science and engineering in a part of the world where the best-educated people still flock to finance or manage it . in a country deeply divided economically , “ what on earth enjoys the benefit of the poor and the downtrodden of deep space research ? ” asks harold physicist annegarn , a professor at the university of johannesburg university of johannesburg . “ the answer , ” he argues , “ is partly that by supporting a thriving , top-level intellectual community , we can train our next generation of intellectuals .
mega-finance , mega-equity , mega-pension funds , and mega-financial crises were the logical result . the crashes of 1929 and 2008 , the unstoppable rise of big tech , and all other components of today ’s discontent with capitalism have become anything but vanished . in such a system , calls for gentler capitalism are mere fads , especially in the post-2008 reality , reaffirming total control over society by mega-firms and shadowy funds , each with its own shareholders . because neither banks nor investors had enough cash to plough mega-firms , a mega-bank emerged in the form of a global cartel of banks and shadowy means , each with its own shareholders . the crashes of 1929 and 2008 , the unstoppable rise of big tech , and all other ingredients of today ’s discontent with capitalism have become inescapable .
cambridge – a few years ago , forecasters seemed confident that global imbalances would re-emerge as soon as the crises passed . that now seems unlikely : neither america nor china is returning to its pre-crisis level of growth or spending patterns . nor are earlier trade balances almost certain to re-emerge . america ’s trade position will be strengthened by a shale-gas revolution that promises energy self-sufficiency and increases in productivity that the auger always further reshoring of manufacturing output . emerging markets , for their part , have learned that export-led surpluses are no guarantee of rapid growth .
still , in what remains of hungary ’s free press , one can occasionally find credible news alleging that prime minister viktor orbán and his fidesz party are steering eu funds to benefit itself , their families , and their business associates . in fact , orbán ’s government has been the subject of a series of investigations by the european anti-fraud bureau . during his election campaign , orbán ’s administration saturated the country in xenophobic , anti-semitic propaganda . still , in what remains of hungary ’s free press , one can occasionally find credible news alleging that prime minister viktor orbán and his fidesz party now hold a two-thirds parliamentary majority , enough to amend the constitution . both governments have cracked down on nongovernmental organizations , focusing or co-opted the media .
following such discussions , the american national institutes of health ( nih ) promulgated guidelines that permit the use of government funds for stem-cell research but , in their later form , prohibit confederate investigators from creating new stem cell lines . this loss of differentiate capacity may be due solely to a particular mode in which stem cells are derived , the conditions surrounding their own growth and other variables to handling them . i believe that restricting the use of government funds to create stem cells , however politically prudent , imposes substantial scientific handicaps . that way , restricting the use of government money for creating stem cells , however politically prudent , imposes substantial scientific handicaps . we know that restricting the use of government money for creating stem cells , though politically prudent , imposes substantial scientific handicaps .
yet , far from accepting such contributions , the plan would actually bring regulators from the process . the plan , for example , would bar regulators from initiating a mega-bank bankruptcy , leaving it up to the discretion of banks ’ own managers . in the nonfinancial sector , failing companies often wait too long before they declare bankruptcy , so lenders may step in to do some of this , potentially even forcing a bankrupt firm . yet , far from accepting such contributions , the plan would , in part , slash regulators from the process . while bank regulators have the tools to pressure the banks similarly , their most effectiveness is the power to initiate insolvency , when the economy is best served .
copenhagen – political rhetoric has shifted away from the need to respond to the “ generational challenge ” of climate change . instead , we are being told about purported economic payoffs , first and foremost the promise of so-called “ green jobs . ” investment in alternative energy technologies such as solar and wind no longer spills over environmentally friendly ways . unfortunately , that does not measure up on economic reality . a copenhagen consensus center asked kaczynski , a senior energy economist at the center for energy economics , the bureau of economic geology at the university of texas at austin , to evaluate the “ state of science ” in defining , measuring , and predicting the creation of green jobs .
after all , we have entered an era in which speed , even more than money , determines the course of events , and where capacity for experimentation across all sectors is an indispensable factor for success . in today ’s winner-takes-all economy , the bulk of newly created wealth accrues to those who innovate the fastest . it is , however , regrettable that the treaty of 28 articles is very fuzzy . it is absolutely essential that this text is complemented by a new method tailored to the current world in which we live , a world where politics no longer exists in muffled debates on ministerial meetings , or through convoluted communiqués . genuine engagement of civil society is the only way to stimulate two struggling governments and overcome their own conservatism .
though there is much that the us can and will do to help itself , the horn of africa can still enjoy some of the benefits of international aid . that means focusing on promoting market economies and stable governments , rather than subsidizing failure and failed states . while there is much that the us can and will do to aid ourselves , the horn of africa can still benefit from international aid . for example , somaliland and ethiopia cooperate on building a gas-export pipeline from ethiopia ’s ogaden region , promising new employment and incomes for people in one of the poorest and least developed parts of the world . but the international community needs to do more than provide food and medicine to the victims of famine and drought .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . trento – the most prominent outcome of the recent european parliament election – is neither the conservatives nor the social democrats have lost the seats to the liberals and the greens , nor the fact that the far-right nationalists won less than predicted . it is that us citizens have voted in a much larger number of larger numbers than anyone expected . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
nevertheless , the laudable effort to prevent such an act from a recurring has had unfortunate consequences . for , in our zeal to learn the lessons from history , we often learn the wrong thing or distort history toward dubious ends . even though mass killings are by no means rare in history , hitler ’s extermination plan was , if not unique , certainly highly unusual . we know that hitler did intend to destroy any last jewish person , a woman , and a young woman . in a sense , the killings at srebrenica also were tainted by memories of world war ii .
but the road for particularistic action that does not undermine liberty and equality for all citizens is narrow . democratic principles call for organizing a society in such ways that both values can be realized to the most possible extent . but the road for particularistic action that does not undermine liberty and equality for all citizens is narrow . that is a sad paradox intrinsic to democracy , and it is politicians ’ duty to address the tensions that it affords to ensure that everyone should go . this might restrict political liberty in the name of more equality .
have those figures reflected alarming imbalances , or are they conventional signs ? if america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s growth rate remains what it has been in the coming decades , the answer is straightforward and terrifying . exterior imbalance would be unnecessary ; indeed , it would be unsustainable . stock market prices , on the other hand , would simply be too high . likewise , households would behave in an overly irresponsible fashion .
moreover , according to better comptetitiveness , foreign investment , france is doing very well . it cites , for example , draining away industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of france ’s decline . but deindustrialization has been common to any kind of advanced country . indeed , france does , in fact , do better than most of its wealthy country rivals , and unlike germany , the uk or the us , has retained the same global market share for the industrial sector it did in the early 1970s . baverez ’s evidence of deflation is not quite as compelling .
if italy and the eu failed to grasp the need to work with non-european countries and make them feel as responsible and fully-fledged protagonists , efforts to establish the icc , and be so close to declaring a universal moratorium on the death penalty , would fail . a second lesson that i have learned is also useful to the eu that finds itself in a world in which new powers are emerging , and where all actors , from manila to algiers , from doha to libreville , must contend with the challenges of globalization and interdependence on a daily basis . this lesson is that europe has more friends than it has enemies . we deserve respect and attention , and that is at least a few of us . so i know that this is not an exact new lesson ; what i have in mind is efficient multilateralism .
the problem is that empathy for the american workers is in tension with empathy for workers in mexico and china , who would have been even worse off without jobs than their american counterparts are . empathy makes us kinder to the people with whom we empathize with . the problem is that empathy for the american workers is in tension with empathy for workers in mexico and china , who would have been even worse off without job training than their american counterparts are . of course , he did not offer any similarly vivid portrayals of undocumented immigrants who are saving the lives of strangers , even though such cases have been reported . empathy makes us kinder to the people with whom we empathize with .
or it could be that national policymakers have little faith in the imf , given that it has essentially missed the global financial crisis . small countries are subject to market discipline , as any latvian tells you . small countries are subject to market discipline , as any latvian tells you . this brings us to the imf ’s fourth role , namely by using its bully pulpit to warn of the risks posed by the largest-country ’s policies . small countries are subject to market discipline , as any latvian tells you .
this is friedrich hayek ’s famous argument against any attempt by governments or central banks to stabilize prices . in any technologically progressive economy , prices should drop except in a few niche markets . after all , businessmen do not require the low rate of inflation to expand production . so what they really need is only the prospect of more selling . provided there is no downward pressure on prices from increased competition for labor , the automatic effect of technological innovation will be to raise the standard of living .
at any rate , they kept alive with earlier points i raised ; namely , that by 2010 , mexico , indonesia , south korea , and turkey would each account for more than 1 % of global gdp . in other words , while its population is slightly larger than that of china or india , its economy is roughly half that of china , but larger than japan ’s ’s ’s , and more than twice that of india . these divergences help to explain why a number of new acronymic groupings have ever since carved out the n-11 , including mint cities ( mexico , indonesia , nigeria , turkey ) , and the fog ( swapping in south korea for nigeria ) . i neither devise these groupings , but these were brought together by them , which produced the bbc radio documentary the mint countries ’ mint in 2014 . just eight years later , the fog economies still have a chance to account for around 2-3 % of world gdp in the future .
america ’s intelligence agencies brought attention to president barack obama ’s russia tactics , warning putin of adverse consequences when the two men met in september 2016 . after the election , obama went public and expelled russian spies and closed some diplomatic facilities , but the weakness of america ’s response undercut any deterrence beyond that . and because president donald trump treated the issue as a political challenge to the legitimacy of his victory , his administration has also failed to take strong steps . america ’s brilliance of russian innovation in information warfare was to combine existing technologies with a degree of deniability that remains just below the overt attack threshold . but obama has been reluctant to call russia publicly or to take forceful action for fear that russia might escalate by attacking us election machinery or voting rolls , and jeopardize hillary clinton ’s expected victory .
cambridge – this year , ’s presidential election campaign in the united states is certainly unique . donald trump has shaken the way in which the campaign is running , how a nominee communicates with voters , and the republican people ’s platform , with many of his posts distance from gop traditions , is sure to be unique . yet , on tax policy , trump has overtoed the party line . he is changing his positions with head-spinning frequency , repeatedly disavowing statements soon after they are made available . to be sure , any assessment of trump ’s declared positions risks becoming meaningless within a couple of hours .
this year on its own , the sources of discord with russia have multiplied and deepened . and it seems likely that russia has intervening directly in western democracies ’ internal politics , using its leaks of sensitive documents and funding the right-wing populists , from marine le pen to donald trump to donald trump ’s support for the kremlin . moreover , ukraine ’s crisis is far from being resolved : the minsk ceasefire agreements are not in doubt , and armed conflict may escalate at any moment . russia has withdrawn from multiple nuclear agreements , and the kremlin recently placed isis missiles that can carry out its medium-range nuclear facility , in kaliningrad , near the polish border . then there is russia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s role in syria , in particular .
trump ’s approach is particularly striking , given that china ’s rapid emergence as a strategic rival is , to be sure , america ’s core national-security concerns . but the deeper question remains : why has trump repeatedly attacked america ’s oldest and most reliable ally ? why , then , does america seem so at first to despise the eu so deeply ? why , then , should america try to undermine europe , rather than seeking closer cooperation in order to protect its own economic and geopolitical interests ? why , then , does america seem so deeply criticized ?
the report – the product of a few months of debate within germany ’s foreign-policy and security community – identifies germany ’s existing values and interests as a commitment to “ human dignity , freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and an international order that is based on universal norms . ” the traditional determinants of states ’ power relative to those of other states , geography , demography , economic heft , and the military might , coupled with availability of resources and technological proficiency , remain significant ; but they are often inadequately confer actual sway on international politics . as gauck has put it , germany ’s “ overriding strategic goal ” must be the “ preservation and continued adaptation ” of this order . in order to achieve this goal , germany must become a “ shaping power , ” ” ” a state with its capacity to solve problems , and to resolve conflicts that affect all or part of the international community . the shaping power builds relationships , and invests in institutions that allow it to operate well with others , and to build and mobilize “ coalitions and networks of like-minded states . ”
even radek sikorski , a former foreign minister and an outspoken critic of the pis government , concluded : “ i believe trump ’s speech was very well done . ” he crafted powerful allusions to poland ’s very history , and were very flattering to the us like poles . and he implicitly denounced gazprom ’s own monopolistic policies , promising to assist poland amid diversification of its gas supply . with his job at hand , trump succeeded in drawing enthusiasm from across the political spectrum , not only from the pis-curated crowds , owing partly to his public greeting opposition leader lech wałęsa – who was booed by pis supporters and remains an enduring destination for jarosław kaczyński , poland an unelected strongman leader . he failed to achieve even a single negative word about poland , germany or france .
add to that china ’s other strengths , annual gdp of more than $ 10 trillion , a growth rate at least four percentage points higher than the global average , $ 3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , a savings rate of more than 40 % of gdp , and a massive trade surplus – and the exchange-rate crisis that makes it highly unlikely . the key will be to get markets and policymakers on the same page . but that does not mean that there are no risks at all . on the contrary , because china has a strong interest in curbing high volatility , and because of china ’s centrality to the global economy , that does the rest of the world the world . add to that china ’s other strengths , annual gdp of more than $ 10 trillion , a growth rate at least four percentage points higher than the global average , $ 3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , a savings rate of more than 40 % of gdp , and a massive trade surplus – and an exchange-rate crisis that seems highly unlikely .
if your behavior is good – ie , you do not drink , beat your wife , and , of course , hand over money to the church – you are fine . many polish bishops basically declare themselves to their flock : you are supposedly listening , not thinking or argue . even young men studying for priesthood are receiving very weak philosophical training , and that is doing purposefully . faith is a matter of its heart ; it knows how . many polish bishops have nearly openly proclaimed to their flock : to listen , not to think or argue .
as in all democracies where the rule of law prevails , members of a particular profession , including journalists , are not granted some form of immunity from these types of serious criminal charges . furthermore , it should be noted that more than 7,000 newspapers and magazines are published in turkey , with total circulation at almost five million copies in the country . both freedom of speech and press freedom are assured by turkey 's constitution and statutes . as in all democracies where the rule of law prevails , members of a particular profession , including journalists , are disregarded by no form of immunity from these kinds of serious criminal charges . in the past 13 years , the turkish government has proved itself to be the main guarantor of freedom of expression , most notably through its judicial reform .
but these countries would be equally wise to signal to china that it is welcome to take its place among the world ’s leading countries if it acts responsibly and according to regulations set for all . indeed , there are some signs that the authorities are doing just that in the south china sea . nationalism could become the ultimate source of legitimacy for a ruling party that can no longer point toward the rapidly rising standard of living . america and others will need to push back in order to ensure that china does not act on all of this temptation . but the larger policy choices will be china ’s side to make .
( little bubbles , in the price of , say , individual stocks , happens all that time , and do n’t qualify as the answer . ) major speculative bubbles , in my view , are social epidemics fostered by inter-interpersonal contagion . but contagion rates depend on behavioral patterns , which are harder to judge . a bubble form when contagion rates go up with ideas that support a bubble . big speculative bubbles , in their view , are rare events .
new york : socialism had its day in court , and it was found wanting . the past half-century has shown that while evolution is possible , it is not inevitable . the grand communist experiment has virtually gone hand in hand ( to save a few holdouts , such as cuba and north korea ) . the ideology of the far right , as represented by the washington consensus of neo-liberal , market fundamentalism , was not much more successful , even if its failures often went unacknowledged . the past half-century has shown that while development is possible , that is not inevitable .
as populists well know , it is notoriously difficult to vote from abroad in eu elections , owing to difficulties registering at the host country , a paucity of polling stations , and over-complicated absentee-voting processes . micro-targeting has proved the most effective not at winning over undecided voters , but at dissuading people from voting altogether . second , with intra-eu migration having intensified , a nearly 15 million europeans now are residing in eu countries other than their own . there is strong evidence to suggest that donald trump ’s micro-targeting operation in the 2016 american presidential election has played a decisive role in core states that he needs to win an electoral college . by collecting or purchasing large voter figures sets , campaigns can segment electorates using complicated algorithms , and then deliver personalized online content to the most susceptible voters .
likewise , perhaps no accident that global financial centers and reserve currencies have emerged largely in countries where the rule of law is well established , and where strangers do not face potential legal discrimination . even if the chinese authorities manage to achieve full convertibility and tradability to service the renminbi , there is no guarantee that it would actually become a global reserve currency , for the simple reason that reserve currencies are not readily fixed . what is also perhaps no accident is that global financial centers and reserve currencies have emerged largely in countries in which the rule of law is sound and where strangers do not face potential legal discrimination . indeed , just three “ ” currencies have dominated in asia : the gold standard , the british pound , and the u.s. dollar . though the deutschemark , the swiss franc , and the japanese yen have all offered viable alternatives to the dollar since world war ii , often providing an better store of value that is less prone to inflation , none has done lasting value into the dollar as a share of global foreign-exchange reserves .
when contemplating which lessons about germany ’s turnaround should apply to other eurozone countries , one has to distinguish between what government can do and what remains the responsibility of business , workers , and societies at large . the turning point in germany ’s public finances was the result mostly of expenditure cuts . germany ran a fiscal deficit close to 4 % of gdp in 2003 , perhaps not high by today ’s standards , but higher than the eu average at that time . the one area where government obviously is in charge is public finance . today , germany has a balanced budget , whereas most other eurozone countries run deficits that are higher than germany was ten years ago .
an example of such a living lab is the “ open data city , ” which i launched with the city of trento in italy , together with the telecom giant italia , telefónica , research university fondazione bruno kessler , intel institute on design , and local companies . this involves moving beyond a closed , question-and-answer process typical in the laboratory and applying our ideas in society , earlier and more often than ever . and where we can no longer count on laboratory experiments to test causality , we must test it in the real world by using massive volumes of real-time data . to see how things work in reality , we need to construct living labs – that is , communities are willing to try new ways of doing things ( blunt , acting like guinea ) . importantly , this kind of living lab has the autonomy and informed consent of all involved ; they understand that they are participating in a gigantic experiment , whose ultimate goal is to create better lives .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . but how europe ’s political toolkit works in practice suggests that it does not bode well for exercising power abroad . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . because the eu lacks an army or a pivotal secret service , it needs to use economic policies to achieve its geopolitical objectives .
to rehabilitate the roof , we may have to accept the less extravagant summer vacation in the first place . we all recognize this from our personal private budgets , which we may have to accept . trade-offs also pervade environmental policy : cutting more of one pollutant , for example , leaves with fewer resources to engage in further solutions to another issue . theirs is an exercise in cheaper wine , which we may have to accept a less extravagant summer holiday .
london – the british election called by prime minister theresa may for june 8 will transform the outlook for britain ’s politics and its relationship with europe ; but not necessarily in the way that a vastly rising majority might give may ’s conservative party a chance to imply . first , by bringing forward the british election in may , may has effectively stretched the deadline for britain ’s withdrawal from the european union from 2019 until 2022 . the scorched-earth defeat that conservative euroskeptics expect to inflict on britain ’s ’s ’s internationalist and progressive forces was symbolized by may ’s own election announcement : “ crush the saboteurs . ” britain ’s pro-european progressive forces could still snatch victory from the eu ’s defeat for three related reasons . first , by bringing forward the british election , may has effectively extended the deadline for britain ’s ’s ’s ’s withdrawal from the european union from 2019 until 2022 .
then again , perhaps we tend to be fortunate that some of the world ’s turmoil will not get any better . it ’s more than curious to argue that the rest of the world has to cope with a built-in advantage to china ’s own exporters , because its authoritarian political system can not cope with any change . elsewhere , of course , that sort of turmoil has a democratic safety net . from east to west , politics seems to operate in such a manner as a diplomatic , suboptimal form . no wonder the spectacular premier is thought to favor some political loosening .
princeton – the largest unresolved issue in europe nowadays is mobility . ever since the 1986 single european act stripped restrictions on working in other member countries , the continent has been a single labor market , at least in theory . but some recent electoral results indicate that they were more worried about losing the nation . under this vision , the eu ’s inhabitants have had a nation to disappear , and the continent most in order to gain . the integration process was meant to ensure that europeans can move from one country to another .
a better alternative would be to move toward a more flexible eurozone in which elected national representatives have greater say . with no-bailout rule re-emerging , governments would have more space to pursue countercyclical policies , responding to voters ’ shifting priority . but rising animosity among eurozone member states , and the erosion of support for european integration among both creditor and debtor countries , means greater federalism is politically unviable – and potentially even dangerous . a better alternative would be to move toward a more flexible eurozone in which elected national representatives have greater say . common political institutions , accountable to voters throughout the eurozone , would provide a democratic fiscal counterpart to the ecb , and help cage german power .
bogotá , lima , santiago – international economic coordination is as necessary as it is elusive . during the global financial crisis , the g-20 has become the primary forum to agree on fundamental principles in areas like fiscal-policy reaction and the international monetary fund ’s role . by underscoring the need to avoid trade protectionism and other beggar-thy-neighbor policies , it has also put some pressure on governments concerning what can not be done . more recently , however , with the g20 attempting to reconcile divergent national economic interests and healing strategies , it has been far less successful relative to its founding meetings in washington and london in 2009 . in these respects , the g20 has been clearly a step forward .
cambridge – back in august , the business roundtable , which covers america ’s chief of staff , america ’s largest company , with combined annual revenue of over $ 7 trillion , has updated its longstanding statements about corporate purpose . and the declaration of principal author , in his apparent exhilaration , is reported to have said that it felt like thomas jefferson drafting a declaration of independence . it ’s not only for shareholders , ceos say ; their firms must now be committed to all stakeholders , including customers , employees , suppliers , communities , and the environment . in fact , shareholders have came in recent times on the ceos ’ ’ new list . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
for example , the neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus , which is stifled by acute , chronic stress , overruns through many antidepressant therapies . still , one of the problems of many current medications is that , even with treatment – recurrence of the major depression – it is extremely high – around 70-80 % . lithium , a mood stabilizer , and a neuroprotective agent , have the characteristics that we aspire to do , though its toxicity makes it less than an ideal toward it . still , one of the problems of many existing medications is that , even with treatment , recurrence of the major depression is very high – around 70-80 % . this suggests that the underlying depressive processes – those that may also produce structural changes in the brain – are not being completely arrested and thus are thus urgently needed to create a new generation of anti-depressant medications .
that ’s also the view shared by betty ming liu , who blogged in response to chua ’s article : “ parents like amy chua are the reason why asian-americans like me are in therapies . tiger parenting aims to get children to make the most of what skill they have is , and so appears to lean toward the “ smart ” ” women of the “ smart ” side of the “ smart or happy ” choice . chua would reply that reaching the high degree of achievement brings great satisfaction and that the only way to do that is via hard work . tiger leaping parenting aims to get children to make the most of what skill they have , and so would seem to lean toward the “ smart ” side of the “ smart or happy ” choice . chua would reply that reaching the high level of achievement brings great satisfaction , and that the only way to do that is via hard work .
one is that a startling mass of populist leaders has managed to position themselves in power in recent years . most of them are individuals like president hugo chávez of venezuela ( as well as other latin american leaders ) or italy ’s former prime minister silvio berlusconi . the other team tells us two things , most of which could be further off the table . mostly , they are entering the political scene from france but managing to form a highly personalized grouping , such as jörg haider and his austrian freedom party , jean-marie lepen , and his french nationalists , andrzej lepper and his polish peasant party , or prime minister robert fico and his direction in slovakia . many more such names could be added .
after much soul-searching , i voted for the bill , although without any acute sense that i are striking a blow to freedom . families have fewer and fewer children bothering to marry , and marriage is considered less and less like a lifelong union . thus one of the “ unintended consequences ” ” ” ” ” bill might be to add welcomed recruits on the married ranks , even if these recruits constitute a historically unusual form . there is a clear status benefit to the minority ; no obvious harm is being done to the majority ; and the long-term consequences are inconsequential . fewer and fewer people are bothering to marry , and marriage seems to be viewed less and less like a lifelong union .
setting the right example is another critical form of communication for leaders . during the recent financial crisis , obama proved himself to be a talented communicator . anticipating a skeptical public reaction when singapore raised government salaries in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong announced that he would forgo the raise himself . in the wake of the recent financial crisis , obama proved himself to be a talented communicator . anticipating a skeptical public reaction when singapore raised the salaries of government officials when he took office in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong announced that he would forgo the raise himself .
london – existing antibiotics have become increasingly ineffective , not only at struggling common illnesses like pneumonia and urinary wastes , but also at treating a range of infections , such as tuberculosis and malaria , that now risk becoming untouched . with g-7 leaders committed in their recent joint declaration to tackle “ antimicrobial resistance ” ( amr ) , this is time for the more inclusive g-20 – and china , as it chairs the group for the first time ever , to take a fight to the next level . at that point , an estimated $ 100 trillion in global gdp will already have been lost . indeed , by 2050 , ten million people could be dying as amr , up from around 700,000 today , with china and india each housing some one million sufferers . failure to address amr will affect everyone , regardless of their nationality or their country ’s level of development .
sydney – the appointment of five provincial-level chinese communist party chiefs in early december serves as a reminder that the ascension of china ’s next generation of leaders to take power in 2012 may be the most significant development in chinese politics since deng xiaoping ’s reign began in 1978 . the upcoming generation of leaders will be the first with little or no personal memory of the tumult and hardship endured during mao zedong ’s years . all five appointees came after the founding of the people ’s republic in 1949 . forgetting that came to doom china to repeat the mistakes of the past ; but , for better or , it may also ease constraints and set its leaders freedom . the upcoming generation of leaders will be the first with little or no personal memory of the tumult and hardship endured during mao zedong ’s years .
in this set of possible outcomes , one stands out : uncertainty about europe ’s role in the future of the global system . to avoid inexorable decline , europe must attain clear decisions on three fundamental issues . first , eu leaders must determine how to resolve the euro crisis . in this set of possible outcomes , one stands out : after all , uncertainty about europe ’s role in the future global system . finally , there is the ongoing chaos scenario .
america ’s dollar is a safe haven , but the savers in need of liquidity still lack an impartial lender of last resort . the question today is whether america ’s rich and other reserve-currency countries share the burden of maintaining global currency stability , through an agreement resembling the 1985 plaza accord , in which the five major economies have agreed to depreciate the us dollar against the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark . if not , why would asia ’s net lenders , especially china , continue to finance speculation against themselves ? recent experience has taught china the true engineers of maintaining global currency stability , through an agreement resembling the 1985 plaza accord , in which the five major economies have agreed to depreciate america ’s dollar against the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark . but bank deleveraging ( brought about by stiffer regulatory requirements ) coupled with negative interest rates caused financial institutions to plummet , leading to a further pro-cyclical doom loop through price deflation , rising illiquidity , and overcrowded exits .
there can be no electricity for as little as eight hours per day . we saw buildings taking place in the air , and not only the former hamas headquarters still standing in rubble . and a good deal can be made of transportation , with new vehicles smuggled in through tunnels beneath a “ philadelphi , ” which runs along the egyptian border . the real world of life , however , is also a traumatic and limited issue . houses are riddled with bullet potholes .
falling prices have paralyzed japan ’s economy for a decade or more . despite having conquered inflation , central bankers continue to fight it , and because it can not confront its most recent economic dangers – global deflation . many central bankers are like the proverbial general who is planning to fight the last war . despite having conquered inflation , central bankers continue to fight it , and because they can not confront the latest bout of economic deflation – global deflation . falling prices have paralyzed japan ’s economy for more than a decade .
extraterritorial sanctions are the second way that america could kill the jcpoa . already , the world needs to steadfastly resist another ruinous us military adventure in the region . this is clearly on america ’s agenda , especially with the neoconservative doyen , john bolton , returning at the white house as the national security adviser . in fact , the world must steadfastness of another ruinous us military adventure in the region . this is clearly on america ’s agenda , notably the neoconservative doyen , john bolton , back the white house as the national security adviser .
it was probably in response to this impasse that china pressed ahead with the establishment of the aiib . the size of china ’s economy , together with its resulting diplomatic weight , provides a reality that can not be wished away . critics of america ’s policy point to the fact that , although america thwarted efforts to establish the aiib , china would continue to project power in asia and around the rest of the world , one way or another . channeling that influence through the newly-created international organization , they argue , tends to temper raw power grabs . the size of china ’s economy , together with its resulting diplomatic weight , is a fact that can not be wished away .
tel aviv – american president-elect donald trump has said many about foreign affairs without really saying something at all . he thinks in terms of immediate gains and loss , adhering to that narrow-minded , an isolationist approach is unlikely to do anyone much good . his muddled pronouncements offer little insight into what kind of foreign policy he will actually pursue , and there is little reason to believe that , when its approach becomes obvious , it will be what the united states – or the world – needs . trump is a businessman , not a statesmanlike figure . his muddled pronouncements offer little insight into what kind of foreign policy he will actually pursue , and there is little reason to believe that when its approach becomes obvious , it will be what the united states – or the world – needs .
but business investment as a share of gdp has varied very little in america over the past decade , while it has risen precipitously in many other countries , including china , singapore , south korea , and israel . for example , transnational companies , whether headquartered in the us or elsewhere , accounted for roughly 84 % of private ( non-bank ) r & d investment in the us in 2009 , about the same as a decade earlier . and american multinationals still locate around 84 % of their r & d activity in the us , often in innovation clusters around 84 % of all us research universities . meanwhile , us multinationals are the largest business-r & d investors in the us and other countries . in 2009 , business accounted for 75 % of r & d financing in japan , 73 % in south korea , 72 % in china , 67 % in germany , and 60 % in the us , whose companies are the largest r & d investors in us , spending more than twice as japanese firms .
beijing – measured by the percentage of people living in their cities , china ’s urbanization rate currently stands at around 48 % , according to official statistics . but it remains largely unsatisfactory , because most other countries at a similar stage of development experienced faster urbanization than industrialization . another striking difference between china and some other developing countries is that chinese cities , big and small , lack any sign of significant urban poverty or slums . china ’s urbanization has lagged behind its industrialization , which now stands at around 70 % , when measured by the percentage of the labor force whose incomes are derived primarily from nonfarm operations . given that urban dwellers ’ share of urban dwellers were only 18 % in the past 30 years , this is an impressive development indeed .
implementing democracy , with or without regime change , was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism . today , iraq may be on the brink of a civil war between shiites and sunnis . implementing democracy , with or without regime change , was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism . today , iraq may be on the brink of a civil war between shiites and sunnis . a free electoral process brought hamas to power in palestine and the unfortunate episode of the danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the nearly combustible mix of relations between islam and the west .
last january , lula visited israel with a string of leading brazilian businessmen , and he signed off on a $ 1 billion trade and investment deal funds . the unfolding uribe-lula-calderón troika holds geo-strategic clout , because things have started to change in cuba ever since fidel castro formally handed over to his brother , raúl . calderón ’s uncompromising tough line on drug dealers in mexico , an unrelenting offensive that follows the precedent uribe has set in dealing with the farc , has also been helped , because economic growth has dimmed domestic opposition . latin america is obsessing about this transition , and both uribe , calderón and lula have no intention of letting chávez lead the way . this has made it easier for lula to buck his socialist allies , and the distance himself of chávez , has as recently as march 2008 backed chávez following colombia ’s brief incursion into ecuador , which killed farc commander raul reyes .
stockholm – the first act began in the fall of 2013 , when then-president viktor yanukovych duped the european union and its leaders by refusing to sign a long-planned association agreement . instead , he chose to have ukraine into a customs union with russia , in exchange for a stockpile of cash and cheap oil and natural gas . russian president vladimir putin apparently achieved his policy aim , namely to bring ukraine , which has drifted toward europe throughout the post-soviet era , firmly back into the kremlin ’s sphere of influence . what is not well known is how many more acts this sorry political spectacle will have , and thus when – and how – it ends up . before our eyes , a tragedy in a few acts is unfolding , in which the players and their aims are clear .
but there is a bigger question lurching behind the gge : can norms truly limit state behavior ? in scope , these constraints can vary from globally to plurilateral , to bilateral . but beyond formal treaties , normative constraints on states also include codes of conduct , conventional state practices , and widely shared expectations of proper behavior among the group ( which create coalitions of law ) . most experts agree that the global treaty of cyberspace would currently be politically impossible ( though russia and china have made such suggestions at the un ) . but there is a bigger question lurking behind the gge : can norms truly limit state behavior ?
monetary policy , however , is a much more clumsy , indirect , and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy does . think of the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus their creditors . think of the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus lenders . independent central banks may occasionally create pain for politicians , but at least they may become accustomed as scapegoats when the leadership necessitated a role whose political advantages outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful tool . to be sure , currency policy also has redistributive effects .
as a result , low interest rates and non-market interference , rather than a business demand , fueled an explosive credit boom in the first half of 2009 , surpassing the fed ’s own target . indeed , in recent months , china suffered from a liquidity shortfall and a credit crunch . had commercial banks been allowed to base lending decisions solely on economic considerations , credit and money supply would have grown more slowly , limiting the risk of rising bad-loan ratios , stalled enterprise reform , inflationary pressures , and the re-emergence of asset bubbles as excess liquidity enters equity and real-estate markets . the government was also overly generous in helping to revive real-estate demand and , overwhelmed by the fear of the adverse impact of falling asset prices on economic growth , was also all too cautious in dealing with the bubbles when they appeared to occur . unlike america , china , which was actually skyrocketing in recent months , in recent months .
it is hard to imagine a more symbolic blow to ataturk ’s vision . now a constitutional reform supposedly aimed at “ promoting turkey ’s eu membership ” would further curb the military ’s role as the guardian of the secular state and enhanced governmental control of the judiciary . now a constitutional reform supposedly aimed at “ promoting turkey ’s eu membership ” would further curb its ottoman forbears as the guardian of the secular state and enhance the governmental control of the judiciary . to back turkey in its strategic shift , a new law recently created an arabic naval order in schools . erdogan believes that by exercising turkey ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s vision for mediation , he will recover the burden of his ottoman forbears as the guardian of the secular state and increase governmental control over the judiciary .
change for the better could emerge only from practical initiative , rather than from sunday ’s speeches . so both he and giscard created the council of europe ( composed of european governments ’ heads ) that now form a major player in euro-atlantic institutional set-up . they pushed forward the notion of currency integration that emerged at fruition a generation later . he remained skeptical about notions of irreversible progress . they pushed forward the notion of monetary integration that emerged with fruition a generation later .
if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . while the probability that prime minister theresa may will soon be ousted could create the impression of a constitutional crisis , the reality is that , at some point , political conditions are certain to stabilize as soon as a period for renegotiating uk-eu relations spread again from the new , very soft , by the april 12 deadline until or beyond . for britain , the prospects are suddenly much brighter and better than at any time since june 2016 .
after the iranian “ no , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” can the union find salvation in nato ’s vision of a “ coalition of the willing ” ? of course , the iranian “ no ” is not the equivalent of the eu of what the afghan quagmire represents for nato . it no longer dreams of becoming the “ united states of europe , ” as well as jacques delors ’ suggestion of “ the united nations of europe ” has remained too ambivalent , if not deliberately ambiguous , to prove effective . yet it also represents a major setback and a challenge to an institutional , political , and even psychological reality . can the most resolute pro-integration europeans leave the pack without being paralyzed by a left-right coalition ?
indeed , terrorism has and will continue to be one of that era ’s scourges . the struggle against the islamic state is not a conventional war , but it is a one that can not be fought in the first place . good news , although it is that the threat posed by the islamic state to the middle east and to the outside world can diminish dramatically through sustained , concerted action to do so as well . good news , though , is that the threat posed by the islamic state to the middle east , and to the outside world , can be reduced dramatically through sustained , concerted action to do so . what is also called for is a dose of realism .
small and medium-size firms need to become part of mexican capitalism . mexico ’s own skillful success at rebuilding opec ( boosting the value of its oil exports ) contributed to good performance as has the resolve to hang on , and even widen , the reforms of mr. zedilla ’s predecessor , president salinas . but the currency board will also help kick-start financial intermediation in the benefits of the small and medium-size firms that have been starved of capital through experience of recurrent crises and bad lending . small and medium-size firms need to become part of mexican capitalism . mexico ’s own skillful success at rebuilding opec ( boosting the value of its oil exports ) has contributed to good performance just as it has fixed america next door and huge liquidity in global capital markets .
it demands a sense of social responsibility that accompanies and cushions the painful process of modernization . she is , in part , self-defense , in part an assertion of the rule of law in difficult circumstances , and partly a constructive effort to redress the causes of frustration . hence the struggle against al qaeda is not a war , but a total view of the future – which means readiness to face it by delaying instantaneous gratification – is also a hallmark of the liberal order . such aid will not yield immediate results , but medium-term awareness – which means readiness to face it by delaying instantaneous gratification – is also a sign of the liberal order .
these are those groups that have been criticized by the obama administration and others for its failure to present a united front , formulate a credible agenda , or be seen as a viable alternative to the status quo . groups like the syrian national council are loose associations of individuals and groups , many of them outside syria . but these groups have limited influence over local opposition groups within syria that are equally heterogeneous and divided . it is of these groups that have been widely criticized by the obama administration and others for their failure to present the united front , formulate a credible agenda , or be seen as viable alternatives to the status quo . fear of another islamist takeover offers the second main argument against toppling assad , but the longer it remains in power , the greater the gains that islamists have made on the ground .
by contrast , 30 years of financial deregulation made possible by the capture of regulators ’ hearts and minds , and by politicians on both sides of the aisle had given a narrow private-sector elite – much of it at wall street – nearly any upside – to the housing boom . the downside was shoved up onto the rest of society , particularly the relatively uneducated and underbanked who was now losing their houses , their jobs , their hopes for their children , or all the above . as a result , these people did n’t cause the crisis , and only they did they . but this was n’t the case for over-regulating and over-getting accomplished . the downside was shoved in the way of the rest of society , particularly the relatively uneducated and under-saving , who are now losing their houses , their jobs , their hopes for their children , or all above .
french leaders have shown the inability to communicate effectively or apply past experiences in analyzing contemporary threats . instead , they are resorting to diversionary tactics by coddling overblown rhetorical battles of lesser controversies . the recent downturn in france ’s industrial output has generated large trade deficits and undermined the competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises . unemployment stands at around 11 % , with a record-high 3.3 million workers registered as jobless in october . at the same time , the political crisis impedes the government ’s pursuit of tough reform .
mumbai – as india gears up for its general election next month , it has some cause for celebration : extreme poverty is finally on the brink of retreat . to this end , much remains to be done . escaping abject destitution , however important , is not the same as achieving a decent living standard and a sense of economic safety . in 2012 , two decades after the government initiated a series of economic reforms aimed at opening the economy , the official rate of poverty to 22 % was below half that prevailing in 1994 . yet it is time for india to raised its aspirations .
yet , far from producing space for diplomacy , trump ’s adviser , sebastian gorka , recently told the press that , “ the idea that secretary of defense tillerson was means to discuss the military ’s issues is simply nonsensical . ” south korea ’s political leaders also must avoid being swept up by this intensifying war-rhetoric . if that does not change soon , the us may , as then-british prime minister david lloyd george wrote of world war i , “ it is [ muddle ] into war yet again . ” likewise , south korea ’s political leaders must avoid having been swept away by this intensifying wartime rhetoric . if that does n’t change soon , the us may , as then-british prime minister david lloyd george wrote of world war i , “ [ muddle ] yet again ” to war .
likewise , alemán , for his part , faces a rebellion within his own liberal constitutional party ( plc ) , headed by former treasury minister eduardo montealegre , a likely presidential hopeful popular within the liberal wing . though a three-way race is sheer speculation on this point of speculation , it ’s ’s clear that he is offering ortega the best of all electoral worlds . the corporate interests that finance political campaigns are facing a difficult dilemma : are it preferable to align himself with a plc dominated by a corrupt alemán , or to support a new democratic force and risk aiding ortega wins ? ortega is so enticing that ortega is likely to help rehabilitate the arnoldo alemán , the bet that freeing it will serve his own political interests . if alemán blocks montealegre ’s candidacy at the time , and pushes him to form another female political party , ortega has the chance of winning the presidency increase sharply .
friedman and keynes both agreed that successful macroeconomic management was necessary – that the private economy on one ’s own may well be subject to unbearable instability ­and that a strategic , powerful yet limited , but limited government intervention required to maintain stability . a difference of opinion that rested on different judgments about how a world operates that might ( and ultimately was ) be resolved through empirical research , one might say . but , whereas for keynes , the key was to keep the sum of government spending and private investment stable ; for friedman the key was to keep the money supply -- the amount of purchasing power in an readily spendable form in firms and households as much as in stable ones . and you would have been half right to do as well . a relatively minor , technical difference in means you might have said .
the prospect of america ’s monetary tightening coincides with the moves by the european central bank and the bank of japan toward strengthened monetary stimulus . back then , the euro is down 8 % against the dollar since the first half of this year , and the yen is down 14 % against the us dollar . the fourth of the channels , the exchange rate , has already been in play . the result has been an appreciation of the us dollar against the euro and the yen . but “ speculators ” are thinking ahead and shifting away from commodities these days in anticipation of future higher interest rates in 2015 ; the result has been to trigger a price decline ahead for today .
i was aware that judge goldstone , a dedicated and unimpeachable human-rights lawyer , and advocate , shared similar concerns when he was originally formulated . but he was able to work with the council of ’s president to guarantee an agreement that he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as allowing his team to deal with the actions taken by the two parties to the conflict . i decided at the time that i could not undertake a mission on these grounds . i was aware that judge goldstone , a dedicated and unimpeachable human-rights lawyer , and a advocate , shared similar concerns when he was initially approaching . this pattern of activism and inaction by the council gave more credence to those who believe that the un ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s highest human rights body is inherently anti-israel .
though in theory communism aimed at establishing a system of class justice , lenin ’s ’s heirs maintained domestic powers through a brutal security apparatus involving lethal purges , gulags , wide censorship , and ubiquitous informants . the net effect of these brutal actions resulted in widespread loss of belief . in the early cold war , both communism and the soviet union possessed substantial soft power . many communists led the opposition against fascism in europe , and germany believed that communism was the wave of the future . but soviet soft power undercut the exposure of stalin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s crimes in 1956 and the subsequent repression in hungary in 1956 , czechoslovakia in 1968 , and poland in 1981 .
coronado , california – the majority of people no longer think of charles darwin as the psychologist . yet even great philosophers , plato , aristotle , hobbes , hume , locke , kant , schopenhauer , nietzsche , nietzsche , and many others could only describe contemporary mental events and behaviors ; they could not explain their causes . darwin provided the profound understanding that evolution influenced the shape of our minds as strongly as it was the shape of our bodies . in fact , his work revolutionized the field . before darwin , philosophical speculation shaped our psychological understanding , which was caused by evolution .
as marc kirschner , a professor at the harvard medical school , has pointed out in a thoughtful editorial in the journal science : “ one can recognize good science as it occurs , but significant science can be viewed only in a rear-view mirror . ” indeed , assessing the effect of any research project may be challenging . as marc kirschner , a professor at the harvard medical school of economics , has pointed out in a thoughtful editorial in the journal science : “ one can recognize good science as this happens , but significant science can be viewed only in a rear-view mirror . ” even preeminent researchers may underestimate the significance of their findings at a time when they are up . it depicted an older couple at the breakfast table .
america ’s tax code has been already regressive long before trump ’s ’s ’s presidency . indeed , the billionaire investor warren buffett , one of the world ’s wealthiest men , famously complained that it was wrong to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary general . it is now universally recognized that growing inequality is a key economic issue in the united states , with those at the top capturing nearly all gdp gains over the last quarter-century . the new us legislation makes america ’s tax system even more regressive . indeed , when fully implemented ( in 2027 ) , it raises taxes for an increasing majority of americans in the middle ( the latter , the third , and the fourth quintiles ) .
california , an american state with more than two million independent contractors , has tried to settle this question with a new law , the california assembly bill five that codifies us legal criteria to determine how to categorize workers . to win political support for ab5 ’s passage , legislators exempted many types of independent contractors , such as doctors , dentists , and real-estate operatives , on the ground they set their own compensation rates , communicate directly with their customers , and earn at least twice the minimum wage . but ab5 does cover the more than 400,000 us workers driving for platform companies like the ride-sharing service uber and the lyft , and the food-delivery firm doordash . a critical question now confronting us policymakers is whether gig workers should be categorized as independent contractors , or as employees of the platform companies with which they have employment contracts , and for whose customers they provide services . applying the three-part “ abc test ” that many states already use to determine whether a worker is eligible for unemployment insurance , ab5 is making it harder for firms to classify their workers as independent contractors rather than workers .
making matters worse , the modi government has , for the first time in history , invoked section 7 of the rbi act , which allows it to issue directions directly to central-bank governor on issues of public concern . the modi government ’s willingness to move to such lengths indicates that more than interest rates are at stake . to be sure , government ministers can not come right . the government is particularly unhappy with rbi measures aimed at cleaning up india ’s banks , many of which are encumbered by a huge volume of non-performing assets , and have prevented the risks of building in other parts of the financial system . government ministers can , of course , not come right .
it is not that abe of 2012 campaign has lacked ambitions ; he has set a bold economic-reform agenda , and pledged to boost japan ’s global influence . just ask former french president nicolas sarkozy , one can only imagine former french president nicolas sarkozy . to be sure , abe has not faced the type of sky-high expectation that sarkozy and , for that matter , us president barack obama have done . but , after more than two decades of leaders that , apart from junichiro koizumi , have promised little and accomplished much less , japanese voters have had little reason to expect that abe will follow through on his pledges . as any democratic politician will attest , disappointed expectations may well become everyone ’s toughest electoral adversary .
those individuals who do carry at least one copy of a gene variant that does not permit the body to metabolize plavix have a 300 % higher risk of clotting a stent . these individuals who carry at least one copy of a gene variant that does not permit the body to metabolize the plavix have a 300 % higher risk of clotting a stent . the story of the interferon is exceptionally common , present at about 30 % of individuals of european ancestry and over 50 % of those of asian ancestry . the story of the interferon is exceptionally common , present in about one year to patients in the hepatitis c virus . there are alternative drugs , such as the prasugrel or ticagrelor , that can be used instead of plavix to circumvent the problem .
repercussions would also be felt in mexico , where the drug cartels are tearing down the country and america , the world ’s largest source of demand . after all , war , in colombia and elsewhere , frequently unites nations , whereas peace divides them . if chávez ’s venezuelan has become the narco-state in which the regime ’s acolytes are drug lords are drug lords , this reflects their privileged relations with the farc . likewise , west africa would be equally affected , having become a major transit point for south american drugs headed to europe . the repercussions of a genuine end to the colombian armed conflict would be felt far beyond the country ’s borders .
a key plank of the budget is the recognition that reducing poverty requires both rapid economic growth and targeted investment focused on the poorest of the poor . so the budget supports critical areas of market reform and growth promotion , including measures aimed at closing the financial sector , encouraging exports , and liberalizing foreign direct investment . the second pillar of poverty reduction is targeted investment for the poor , particularly for the rural poor . rapid economic growth is supposed to bedevil the private sector , including through foreign direct investment . the budget therefore provides aid to critical areas of market reform and growth promotion , including measures aimed at deepening the financial sector , promoting exports , and liberalizing foreign direct investment .
in fact , exaggerations of the threat of islamist terrorism , while downplaying the threat of right-wing populism , might well play the direct hand of russian president vladimir putin ’s hand . in fact , an exaggeration from the threat of islamist terrorism , while downplaying the threat of right-wing populism , could well play the direct hand of russian president vladimir putin ’s hand . in the middle east , countries are straining against whom they should be contained . the struggle to prioritize threats is not exclusive to the west . for israel ( and saudi arabia ) , the answer obviously is iran .
cambridge – american treasury secretary steven mnuchin is hemmed in on all sides . given trump ’s belief that international negotiations are merely a forum for making unilateral claims , how might mnuchin – who , like his boss , lacks government experience – persuade other countries that adherence to shared rules and norms , like open commerce , are in everyone ’s interest ? but , even on the international scene , where america ’s treasury secretaries typically enjoy more dirigiste and esteem , mnuchin is likely to have hard times . after all , the trump administration has made it clear that it does not intend to fulfill the global leadership commitments that mnuchin ’s predecessors oversaw . domestically , it ’s an imprisoned between promises it made ( like those of “ mnuchin rule ” ) that taxes would not be cut for the rich ) ; president donald trump ’s actions ( whose tax plan incorporates cuts for the rich ) ; and simple arithmetic ( making the administration conflicting pledges impossible to fulfill ) .
cambridge – how should one categorize the agreement reached in paris this month at the un climate change conference ? no sooner was the agreement announced on december 12 than the talks erupted . some avid environmentalists have been disappointed that the deal did not commit strongly to limit global warming to 1.5 º fahrenheit above the pre-industrial level by 2050 . but such a commitment alone would not have been credible . what emerged in paris was actually better , because negotiators could agree on practical steps in the right direction .
fearing for their own safety , muslim professionals began to migrate into ghettos . unfortunately , they were educated at religious seminaries espousing a profoundly intolerant , fundamentalist brand of islam . muslim charitable organizations , often funded by saudi arabia and other arab countries , began moving into areas of social life in which the state had failed dismally , particularly education . as a result , thousands of muslim boys were first enrolled in school . muslim charitable organizations , often funded by saudi arabia and other arab countries , began to move into areas of social life that had failed dismally , particularly education .
workers do not protest menial jobs in capitalistic wenzhou but against no jobs in the socialist shenyang . today , private firms employ more of the working class in the working class in china than in the liberal provinces of zhejiang and guangdong , but in the northeast 's socialist bastions , are really a mystery . why the majority of pundits miss the arrests of workers , not in the liberal provinces of the zhejiang and guangdong transition , but in the northeast 's socialist bastions , is a mystery . the government can not pay out unemployed workers their pensions because socialism bankrupted its finance . with a framers of soes , private firms employ a lot of proletariat , produce the goods demanded by proletarian consumers , and because of their superior performance , safeguard the interests of proletarian savers by actually paying back their bank loans .
but , while we see inequality and exclusion in club-level football , the opposite is true for contests within national teams . poorer or smaller countries can hardly dream of a victory by a european championship , as steaua ( romania ) , a red-star ( serbia ) , or nottingham forest ( now languishing in the english third party ) once did . the same goes for any of the games played at the final tournament , not only those among the top eight national teams . the average winning margin among the top eight world cup national teams has steadily declined , from just more than two goals in the 1950 ’s to some 1.5 goals in the 1960 ’s , 1970 ’s , and 1980 ’s , and only 0.88 goals in the 2002 world cup . the decline in winning margins is all the more impressive because the world cup has grown from 16 to 32 national teams , many of them new and rather uninsured .
in fact , the budget assumes the best of all worlds , not the blue-chip ( inflation-adjusted ) one in which interest rates remain low , but gdp growth ambles along at around 2 % . currently , ten-year treasuries offer more than triple the yield on us treasuries . in the omb paper , the real interest rate on three-month us treasuries is expected to remain below 1 % over the ten years . moreover , in that projection , the present premium disappears almost completely . with true ( inflation-adjusted ) us interest rates remaining near record lows , a pegged rate of prolonged growth as us administration projections suggest would be historically anomalous .
but that antagonism reflected the personalization of politics achieved under berlusconi , as well as the institutional feature that he abolished . one of his administration ’s last acts was to replace the majoritarian electoral system , introduced in 1993 with proportional rule . a new electoral system is changing politicians ’ incentives , and it could induce a return to shifting coalitions and weakened governments . under new electoral rules , seats allotted for parties in proportion to vote , but a special provision induces parties to forge a pre-electoral agreement : a pre-electoral coalition that wins the most votes receives a seat premium that ensures a comfortable majority in the deputies ’ chamber ( the lower house ) . that outcome would accelerate if , as is likely , berlusconi himself would be to distance himself from politics in the upcoming electoral term .
though the current rate of 7 % is comfortable , it is far lower than the double-digit rates that prevailed until 2008 . and it has had some success , to the detriment of economic growth . this bodes well with li , who recognizes that structural transformation and industrial upgrading are not an unsustainable credit-led growth model , he is the key to achieving high-income status . but there is more to his assessment of wen ’s stimulus than the growth/reform trade-off . given the need for more economic restructuring , and given longer-term demographic trends holding back the labor supply , pre-2008 growth rates are unlikely to return .
we need to ensure that infrastructure is constructed to cope with the heightened impact of climate change and develop clear global standards to disclosing the climate-change risks that investment projects pose . here , public-investment institutions , like the european investment bank , can catalyze adaptation in a variety of ways . here , a public-investment community , like the european investment bank , can catalyze adaptation in its many ways . the paris climate challenge demands much deeper collaboration between the public and private sector to drive growth in green investment . we must also ensure that infrastructure is built to cope with the heightened impact of climate change and develop clear global standards for disclosing the climate risks that investment projects pose .
the speaker was not some public-relations executive , but osama bin laden ’s chief lieutenant , ayman al-zawahiri , also long ago . they plan and design headline-grabbing attacks using every means of communication to harass and crack down on the collective will of free men . terrorists have skillfully adapted to fight wars in today ’s ’s media age , but , for the most part , the american and other governments of the other democracies have not . consider that the violent extremists have their own “ media relationships committees ” that target manipulating elite opinion . “ more than half of that battle takes place on the media battlefield , [ for ] the us is entering a media battle in a race for [ muslims ] ’s hearts and minds . ”
recent attempts by filipino lawyers to prosecute civil-claims for the environmental tort and human-rights abuses before american courts expose just how desperate filipino claimants are to seek redress against those who have acted negligently or with impunity . of course , exemplary and punitive damages so that it can discourage inimical to a society do exist at the writ large statute . but the philippine courts have refused to resort to the use of such damage awards as a tool to control behavior , especially of businessmen . all of this helps explain why sulpicio lines , the owner of starbucks ’ princess , has been left in commercial operations against its many lapses . simply put , philippine courts have not made it costly to maintain non-seaworthy vessels .
america ’s congress regards legislation to enable the trump administration to impose sanctions on european firms that engage in the project despite those firms are contractually obligated to see the work through . and , according to gerhard schröder , a former german chancellor that now chairs the pipeline project , america ’s ambassador to germany has been acting in a more like an “ occupation officer ” than like the us diplomat . all told , the trump administration ’s disruptive behavior has left the french and german governments angry . but , beyond fueling anger , trump ’s attacks on other countries ’ sovereignty are adding momentum to a new push for european political unification . it is no secret that europeans are in the midst of an internal economic crisis , the product of the euro saddling southern european countries with high inflation prior to the 2008 financial crash that severely impaired their competitiveness within the euro system .
all have abolished controls over their shared borders , and it has enacted a common visa policy for non-nato citizens . but the refugee crisis has exposed the flipside of the schengen agreement – namely , the difficulty of tracking national and eu territory without border controls . indeed , that appeasement is probably why only two eu countries ( ireland and the united kingdom ) opted out of the schengen agreement . it is certainly handy to treat the flight , from zurich to oslo as a domestic journey , with no passport controls to contend with the departure and advent of the eu . and it is doubtless convenient to drive from berlin to barcelona without having to wait in line at every border one crosses .
such collaboration is vital to combat terrorism , human trafficking , and migration . yet europe has focused more on enforcing shared values within the tech sector – namely , through stronger data privacy regulations – than on developing a long-term strategy to become competitive . defining such a strategy could help europe identify the areas for mutual accommodation . a third area with the potential for strategic collaboration is development aid and investment around the world ’s poorest and most fragile states . europeans have become dependent on such firms , all of which are based in china or america .
the federal government , under both president george w. bush and barack obama , has allocated hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up mega-banks while allowing hundreds of these direst smaller lenders to fail . so , too , in the us , smaller banks that largely finance small , medium-size enterprises have all but been neglected . yet the lending would have been inhibited even by the fact that the banks remain healthier and medium-size enterprises have been all but neglected . just adding liquidity while continuing the current austerity policies will not re-ignite the spanish economy . after all , by the end of the last 20 years , small enterprises have relied on collateral-based lending , and property ’s value , a key form of collateral , still down the third from its pre-crisis level .
the world learned the lesson following the arab-israel war of 1973 . oil is a fungible commodity , and the markets clear at a common price . when the dust settled , it became clear that america , the dutch , and other importers all suffered roughly the same levels of shortcoming , paying an equally damaging high price . but that oil-destined for the us and the netherlands was shifted to other countries like japan , while destined for other countries found its way to america and the netherlands . the arab oil-exporting countries embargoed that the oil selling to the us and the netherlands to punish them for their support of israel .
new york – when the sun sets in myanmar , the fear is rising . but the bullets and clubs unleashed on buddhist monks have worked . the world has alarmed graphic images of myanmar ’s latest crackdown by myanmar ’s military junta . that crackdown continues under the guise of darkness . the argentine monks have withdrawn , and an unending normalcy returned to yangon ( rangoon ) , myanmar ’s principal city and former capital .
the underlying issue is whether europe ’s monetary union needs greater integration in order to manage crises like greece ’s gdp , or whether it can maintain the current approach , founded on national responsibility , and sanctions for those violating the rules . indeed , until the mid-1990s , the government ’s lack of macroeconomic discipline and its inclination to succumb to populist demands , and vested interests accounted for much of the country ’s economic weakness . admittedly , the country experiencing economic performance in the wake of the early-1970s oil shocks was poor , marked by sluggish growth , high inflation and unemployment , enormous fiscal deficits , rising debts , exploding currencies , and inadequate infrastructure . germany ’s finance minister , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that these sanctions should involve expulsion from the eurozone , something that was never envisaged in the european union ’s 1992 maastricht treaty . nor , of course , has greece ever considered confronting its current economic trauma .
in thinking about the future of growth , and the opportunities that continued growth would open up for all of humanity , we should reflect on how far we arrived . in thinking about the future of growth and the opportunities that continued growth would open up for all of humanity , we should reflect on how far we arrived . in the late roman empire , only an abundant aristocrat could buy the nomenclator , a slaorizing tasked with memorizing names and faces , and reminding the former aristocrat of them when the social occasions demanded it . today , having the fundamental smartphone is better than having the entourage of dozens , or even the few thousands , of nomenclator-like aides . again , it would be reludicrously expensive or simply impossible to achieve similar capabilities in earlier periods of history .
insofar as it is true , the united states will not be replaced as the dominant power , unless and until it abdicates that role . as a result , china will become a largely inward-looking superpower , one that – precisely for that reason – will pursue its own foreign-policy interests in an entirely unsentimental way . the vital interests guiding chinese policies are internal modernization , the ruling regime of political stability and survival , and the country of unity ( which includes taiwan ) . those interests are unlikely to change for much longer , if not for long . that may sound straightforward , but it will have far-reaching consequences for the coming century ’s international order .
wages and prices fell , but not enough to enable argentina to compete efficiently , especially given that many of argentina ’s agricultural goods , which constitute argentina ’s natural comparative advantages , face high hurdles in entering rich countries ’ markets . the global financial crisis that followed the east asia crisis laid off a series of large exchange-rate adjustments . the government pursued fiscal austerity , but not enough to make up for the vagaries of the market . the government pursued fiscal austerity , but not enough to make up for the vagaries of the market . the dollar , to which argentina ’s peso was tied , rose sharply in value .
when such a debt-fueled bubble bursts , its effects are transmitted directly to the real economy via the household-industry balance sheets , with reduced consumption contributing to depressed employment and private investment . it is far more difficult to identify the circuit breakers for this dynamic than to , say , triggering balance-sheet distress in the financial industry . yet the chinese authorities appear not to have learned the lessons of either episode . not only failed to mitigate the risks , underscored by the 2007 collapse , that new retail investors introduce into the market ; in fact , they exacerbated them , by allowing and even encouraging , those investors to accumulate leverage through margin purchases . making matters worse , when the current stock-market correction began in early june , chinese regulators relaxed margin-purchase constraints while encouraging state-owned enterprises and asset managers to buy more stocks .
faced with this uncertainty , they do not re-just their spending ; instead , they refrain from spending , until the mists clear , sending the economy into a tailspin . it is this shock , not adjustment , that spreads affect . seventy years ago , john maynard keynes pointed out its fallacy , but no sooner . when such shocks strike , agents did not know what happens next . but i doubt that it has .
over the longer run , most economists agree that governments , especially in the advanced industrial countries with aging populations , should worry about the sustainability of their policies . furthermore , well-designed financial-sector taxes might help to alleviate the problems posed by over-leverage and too-big-to-fail banks . over the longer run , most economists agree that governments , especially in the advanced industrial countries with aging populations , should worry about the sustainability of their policies . the financial sector has imposed tremendous externalities on the rest of society . america ’s financial sector has polluted the world with its toxic mortgages , and , in line with the well established “ polluter pays ” principle , taxes should be imposed on it .
but public reaction to them , together with recent oil-price spikes , may well account for a good measure of change in market psychology . after all , doing so implies that economic events are less predictable ( and economists less omniscient ) than imagine otherwise . attitudes toward risks change over time , and events like ahmadinejad and peres ’s remarks may precipitate such shifts . economists might not like to focus on public thinking and how they interacts with price shifts , the world news stories , and its speculative dynamics . so , while these things happen in ways that are difficult to quantify , perhaps everybody should pay attention to ahmadinejad ’s words just as carefully as they do to those of bernanke in trying to grasp the world ’s stock markets .
new york – in their effort to pass a bailout plan for america ’s financial system , bush ’s administration officials invoked the specter of the great depression of the 1930 ’s . the bonfire sparked the collapse of the thai baht in the summer of 1997 . the asian financial crisis of more than ten years earlier brought banks , corporations , and governments to their knees . contagion soon spread throughout east asia with ripple effects of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as russia and brazil . yet , for most asians , the economic armageddon is far more recent .
plato ’s purpose in dialogue , of course , is not to define piety : if socrates knows a better definition than the unacceptable ones that are offered by euthyphro , he leaves no secret it . and , to know that , one must be as well aware of what one does not know as of what anyone does . one ought to recognize the ethical character of any action one is contemplating . rather , plato ’s point to demonstrating that euthyphro is ignorant of his own ignorance about piety , and that euthyphro thus can not really tell that prosecuting its father is actually the right thing to do . the knowledge that comes from this type of self-examination is critical in any decision .
in north africa , the encroaching desert has displaced many people and exacerbated tensions among farmers and herders . after all , the agricultural sector accounts for 70 % of global freshwater consumption ; with short-supply water , farmers are far less able to feed the world ’s population . moreover , water scarcity , like that of millions of people , means food scarcity . this year , china has experienced its worst drought in a half-century , affecting millions of hectares of farmland , and triggering power shortages . one billion people worldwide lack access to clean drinking water , and more than two billion lack adequate sanitation .
efficiency has skyrocketed , putting brazil ’s crop yields at par with those of the advanced economies . emerging economies must grapple with the resulting growth challenge head-on by pursuing sweeping adjustments of policies , incentives , and established practices to boost productivity . emerging economies must confront the resulting growth challenge head-on , by pursuing sweeping changes to policies , incentives , and established practices to boost productivity . recognizing this imperative is only a first step . the era of “ easy ” gdp growth , driven by the powerful army of youth , is ending .
second , we need the clear message from the g-20 that all of its members deliver the policies for strong , sustainable , and balanced growth . we are confident that europe will act together to meet these challenges , and that such efforts will continue to encourage them , because european stability and growth are necessary for us all . but the magnitude of the challenges confronting europe implies the urgent need for far more determined reform . since the g-20 ’s cannes meeting last november , for example , europe has increased its financial firewalls by € 200 billion ( $ 252 billion ) , restructured greek debt , taking steps to strengthen its banks and banking regulation , established rules for fiscal discipline , and implemented a wide array of labor – and product-market reforms . to be meaningful , the message needs to support action : the g-20 members must demonstrate that their policies are clearly directed toward restoring economic growth and creating more jobs , and will be held accountable for meeting their commitments in full .
but not talking about priorities makes the need to prioritize others . they must work with bureaucracies that are naturally disinclined to have their efforts prioritized lest they end up doing as anything less than number . instead , the choices become only less clear-cut , less democratic , and less efficient . they must work with bureaucracies that are naturally disinclined to have their efforts prioritized lest they end up doing less good ( which is thought good ) . whenever we prioritize , we are told not only where we should do more ( which is good ) , but also where we should not step up our efforts ( which is thought to be cynical ) .
as it stands , surveys show that people tend to believe that inequality is lower than it actually is , but still higher than the levels that they would consider ideal . this is true in most countries – including in the us , where inequality is among the highest in the world – although there are a few countries , such as norway , where people share a more realistic view . correcting these misperceptions will change people ’s opinions of redistributive policies . the point is not to get lost in endless comparisons or arcane math , but to underscore the point that they are possible – and indeed necessary – to have meaningful discussion of inequality based on concrete figures with the goal of establishing clear targets . if the right targets are to be chosen , the debate will have to be better informed .
ordinary russians should be encouraged to understand that permitting putin – whose primary claim to leadership is that he brought an end to the early post-soviet penury of the early post-soviet history – would have cost them dearly . similarly , denying any kind of bank doing business with a russian bank or company access to the american financial system would create the sort of economic chaos last seen in russia immediately following the fall of communism . third , obama should emphasize to the chinese stake in eurasian stability . they have crippled iran ’s economy . putin may regard the soviet union ’s disintegration as a tragedy ; but for china it was the greatest geostrategic gift imaginable .
against that backdrop , it is not surprising that pay in the financial industry has soared . things have been different for the past two years . the city of london , lower manhattan , and a few other centers have become money-machinery that made investment bankers , hedge-fund managers , and private-sector equity folk immoderately wealthy . many financial firms have shrunk their balance sheets dramatically , and , of course , have gone from doing business altogether . university leaders like me have been spending a lot of our time convincing people to recycle around their gains to their old classrooms .
in a february meeting last spring , america ’s ambassador to kyrgyzstan asked her chinese counterpart on tours that china had offered to pay kyrgyzstan $ 3 billion if the kyrgyz shut down an american base . the two diplomats were conversing in russia , and the two diplomats were being conversing . “ visibly flustered , ” the chinese ambassador ) temporarily lost his ability to speak russian , and began spluttering at the chinese to the silent aide diligently taking notes right behind him , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” according to a confidential american diplomatic cables obtained by web site wikileaks.org . the horse-trading surrounding the base has been intense . the us diplomats used to be conversing the way in russia .
in a recent statement about the burning suburbs , chirac declared , “ we will need to draw upon all the lessons of this crisis , when time comes and order has been restored , and with much boldness and lucidity . but those lessons imply reforms that are more far-reaching than chirac ever is a presupposed . in his recent statement about the burning suburbs , chirac declared , “ we will need to draw all the lessons of this crisis , when time comes and order has been restored , and with many boldness and lucidity . but those lessons imply reforms that are more far-reaching than chirac ever would have expected . beyond that , social assistance with little hope of an individual improvement is inadequate .
we are also learning from the hundreds of thousands dead and millions of refugee children in our region that sectarian , ideological , cultural , and religious bigotry have only fueled the fires of rage . we entrust them with driving our country toward a new level of growth and development that is one reason why we have now nominated a cabinet minister of their age , forming a special youth council . we can not , and will not , allow this in our own country , to be allowed to happen . we entrust them with driving our country toward new levels of growth and development , which is one reason why we have now nominated a cabinet minister of their age , and created a specialized youth council . we can not , and will not , allow this in our own countries to become stronger .
so we know that extraordinarily low real interest rates produce massive expansions of credit expansion . in countries with higher price growth than in germany , but with equal borrowing costs , this can produce nothing but overheating , higher inflation , and even lower real interest rates . to stem this outflow of credit-induced demand with fiscal policy alone is impossible and it is absurd to try . to question policymakers in a democracy with large surpluses to raise taxes or cut benefits or public investment by the huge magnitude needed to stave off disaster strikes is to sit back with reality . to ask policymakers in a democracy with large surpluses to raise taxes or cut benefits or public investment by the huge magnitude needed to stave off disaster strikes is to sit on reality .
in the past , undoubtedly , france ( under president mitterrand ) and germany ( under chancellor kohl ) would together regularly press the case for closer integration , despite british reluctance . the problem today , however , both france and germany are less united on a common european strategy , and their commitment to european integration appears less strong . as a result , the french government is reluctant to force a clash with the british , should there be the prospect of a softer compromise in the future . the problem is that this conspiracy of evasion may not work , and fischer ’s relevance , starting with chancellor kohl ) , is that he is the first government minister in office to say so in public , despite british reluctance . but the bottom line is that constitutional amendments may not work , and fischer ’s significance , starting with the uk , would resist any overtly federalist agenda .
in my view , the intellectual case for activist policies , as made , for example , by dani rodrik and ricardo hausmann of harvard , is powerful . critics describe it as the new label of modern industrial policy , which can help push brazil beyond its traditional role as a commodity exporter . markets for innovation and new ideas work poorly , and governments can help tackle these market failures . but rodrik and hausmann also show that acquiring such policies implies exacting requirements . critics call it a misguided effort that creates only more distortions and retard growth .
to be sure , gender imbalances are not the only driver of anti-immigrant sentiment , much less populism more broadly . but the evolutionary psychology that stresses competition for females may add another dimension to our understanding of these phenomena , while helping us to predict when and where civil strife might erupt . to be sure , gender imbalances are not the only driver of anti-immigrant sentiment , much less populism more broadly . but the evolutionary psychology that stresses competition for females may add another dimension to our understanding of these phenomena , while helping us foresee when and where civil strife might erupt . there is little that can be done to change gender imbalances in a particular place .
new haven – codependency never ends well in personal relationships , either . in its most fundamental respect , codependency occurs at one of the extremes of the relationship dynamics of any one , whereby two partners draw more from one another than from their own internal strength . judging by the ongoing escalation of the trade war between the united states and china , the same goes for economic relationships . while i published a book in 2014 on the fully codependent us economic relationship between the american and china , i would be the first to concede that it is a stretch to generalize insights from human psychology to gauge the behavior of national economies . but the similarities are striking , and the prognosis all the more compelling is that the world ’s two largest economies are drifting into a perilous quagmire .
throughout the cold war , what was once the soviet union provided the raison d’être of a european union ; in an era of globalization , it is americanization . comparing and contrasting the two sides of the atlantic has a long pedigree . this is the point at which many start using the language that defines europe by distinction , indeed , to america -- europe as antiamerica . but how is this identity to be defined ? european cultures and american commerce , european profundity , and american materialism -- these are ancient and weary themes .
with this trade diversion likely to travel to higher-cost platforms worldwide , america ’s consumer will be hit with the functional equivalent of a tax hike . alas , lighthizer seems as clueless in the macro argument today as it was back then . with this trade diversion likely to migrate to higher-cost platforms all over the world , america ’s consumers will be hit hard by the functional equivalent of the tax hike . in both episodes , the us has been in denial , bordering on delusion . without boosting national saving , highly unlikely according to america ’s current budget trajectory , trade will simply shift away from china to america ’s other trading partners .
france ’s center-left government must lead in conceiving a vision for a europe in which solidarity and equity boosts long-term economic strength . if it can renege on the european model at home , it could project that success far more widely , particularly in southern europe , in turn reinforcing trust and faith in the eu , particularly among young people . finally , along with the united kingdom among the european countries , france retains more of a global role than germany has acquired so far . both hollande and prime minister jean-marc ayrault have strong majorities , at all the executive and legislative levels , providing a rare opportunity to act . while the united nations security council is obsolete in its structure , france still plays a critical role ; and france , not germany , is a member .
many outsiders underestimate , or purposefully , the “ arabness ” of the arab world . but the 2011 revolutions have shown a strong sense of identity , collective languages , and a much shared history bind arabs together despite vast differences in natural-resource endowments , political conditions , and mediocre per capita incomes . the third challenge , instrumental in this meeting the first two , will be to bolster regional arab solidarity . deep reform – focused on quality and performance , rather than on enrollment and diplomas – is needed to transform the learning process and unleash the productivity growth that a young labor force requires . how else can one explain the insurrection act in tunisia , led to the popular revolts from north africa to the arabian peninsula ?
america ’s largest tech firms are starting to compete for the talents of their talents by offering paternity leave . attitudes about male caregiving are beginning to shift in america . only one-third of male millennial men are confident of traditional gender roles . by offering the paternity leave , who is now the world ’s largest tech firms are only one-third of those who are able to work together . who has the more flexible work ?
how fast this will happen , in part , depends on the private sector ’s flexibility and dynamism . but it also depends on the government ’s ability and willingness to provide bridging function for missing aggregate demand and the pursuit of reforms and investments that boost long-term growth prospects . muted wage growth boosts competitiveness and underutilized labor and capital flight . if public-sector deleveraging is not a complete growth policy , and does not – why is there so much focus on fiscal austerity and so little action ( as against lip service ) on growth and employment ? several possibilities – not mutually exclusive – come to mind .
on the other hand , when many individual americans ’ personal situations are scrutinized via the european eyes , extreme individualism that constitutes an essential part of american optimism translates into an unacceptable social scandal . it is wrong to assume , as some ultra-loose marketers do , that the absence of welfare makes you feel stronger . journalists report the tragic stories of middle-class americans losing out on their jobs and homes , potentially putting their lives at risk with no social protections . who will pay for your expensive cancer treatment if you lose your health-insurance policy that came with your job ? journalists report the tragic stories of middle-class americans losing their jobs and homes , potentially putting their lives in danger without a social protection .
warsaw : recently poland experienced a typical -- and typically unfinished -- political debate . because of their domination within the parliament , the postcommunists ’ intransigence on this point forced the other political parties involved in drafting poland ’s new " red-green " constitution kowtow to his positions . one gave rise to this question whether a " free " education was to be made a constitutional right . only by raising the issue to the level of the constitutional right , say the postcommunists , can the guarantee of free and equal access to education be preserved . a free , or as his postcommunist supporters might prefer to call it , a " not paying for " education , " meaning education in communist-owned schools and state-owned universities ( but not at private schools ) .
last but not least , local institutions , nongovernmental organizations , and local communities must be mobilized – for example , through public campaign showcasing the benefits of harnessing the potential of unconventional water sources . the private sector also has a role to play in moving toward unconventional water sources , a role that must broaden beyond the current effort to tap desalinated water and urban greywater and wastewater . sustainable development goal 6 calls for universal access to clean drinking water and sanitation . best practices should be clarified , innovations identified and tested , and knowledge and experience shared by the national public . at every level , governments must also clarify national water agencies ’ responsibilities and improve water-related capacity at every level to institute large-scale unconventional-water programs .
america ’s negotiators are fixated on targeted reductions of around $ 200 billion in the bilateral trade imbalance over a two-timeframe . given the scale of america ’s multilateral problem , this is largely an inconsequential objective , especially given the heavy and ill-timed tax cuts and federal spending increases that america has enacted over the past six months . as a result , targeting china has an outsize political appeal . american negotiators are fixated on targeted reductions of about $ 200 billion in the bilateral trade imbalance over a two-year-long pattern . given the scale of america ’s multilateral problem , this is largely an inconsequential objective , especially given the heavy and ill-timed tax cuts and federal expenditure cuts that america has enacted over the past six months .
economic relations with the west would not be diluted by this shift . the unprecedented economic expansion that lifted millions out of poverty was accompanied by widening income disparities , together with severe environmental damage . asia needs strong , inclusive , green , knowledge-led growth , which implies the need to rebalance sources of economic dynamism to emphasize domestic , regional , and inter-regional , “ south-south ” demand . as a result , asia now has two prospects : a prosperous , rising middle class , and those that can enjoy rapid economic development so far , and whose health and well-being are being adversely affected by acute problems like air and water pollution . in short , the key challenges facing asia today are to sustain economic growth – at lower but still enviable – rates , tariffs , and improved quality .
berkeley – the central insight of macroeconomics goes from the observation of john stuart mill in his first third of the nineteenth century : one can have a large gap between supply and demand for pretty much all currently produced goods and services and types of labor if there is an equally large excess demand for financial assets . the economy rapidly rebalances itself and thus returns to full employment – and does that with the configuration of employment and production that is better tailored to current consumer preferences . as industries suffering from under-demand shed labor , industries benefiting from surplus excess demand that hire them . a normal gap between supply and demand for some subset of the currently produced commodities is not a serious problem , as it equates with a pattern of excess demand for other currently produced commodities . the economy rapidly re-balances itself and thus returns to full employment – and does this with a configuration of employment and production that is better tailored to current consumer preferences .
the prosecution then began to talk the young girl like a chechen sniper from the sniper family of snipers . russian liberals initially welcomed the case of budanov as a sign that the country might address accusations that war crimes had been committed in chechnya . last month , though it was , the army prosecutor embraced colonel budanov 's argument that he was being temporarily insane when he killed the girl and so acquitted budanov on charges of murder . rage , defense minister sergei ivanov denounced the prosecutor , seeming to have been ready to abit the " patriotic " on every remaining charges . ( the murder charges , for some ambiguous reason , had already been brought down . )
the plan must recognize that during this protracted period of monetary expansion , both financial markets and resource-allocation practices have been distorted , exacerbating wealth inequalities . the good news is that the incoming administration may draw on the measures formulated during obama ’s tenure , but which gained little traction , owing to the highly polarized and dysfunctional congressional politics that characterized most of obama ’s eight years in office . such steps address imperatives like infrastructure investment , tax reform , and job creation . once the team is in place , its members will need to figure out how to compel trump ’s plans to work for an economy that has – through necessity – by necessity , not choice , excessively reliant on unconventional monetary policies . but , of course , america does not exist in a vacuum .
washington , dc – just over a hundred years ago , the united states was taking the world seriously in terms of rethinking how big business worked , and at a time when the power of such firms was supposed to be in thrall to them . prior to the 1890 ’s , big business was widely thought to be more efficient , and generally more advanced than little enterprise . most people saw the competition of smaller firms into the fewer , large firms as a stabilizing development that rewarded their success and enabled their further productive investment . in retrospect , the breakthrough legislation – not only to america , but also internationally – was the sherman antitrust act of 1890 . the dodd-frank financial-reform bill aimed at pass the american senate does something similar – and long overdue – to the banking sector .
tokyo – when was the last time you are sitting and writing a letter ? the cause , i ask , is that , in fact , 65,000 people actually had written such letters to barack obama each week , when he served as president of the united states . no , i mean an old-fashioned , “ dear donald ” or a “ dear hillary ” letter . i do not mean an email or a piece of text ; nor would i count a dictated message to the machine or personal assistant . according to a recent feature of the guardian , a team of white house staffers would select ten letters every day to pass along with the president , who would then respond personally that the evening .
they might tell pollsters that they had been prepared to pay higher taxes for better public services and a more compassionate attitude toward the poor . today , this pseudo-marxist theory of economic determinism has been intervening once and for all . in 1992 , john major ran for re-election in the middle of the economic slump , a vicious monetary squeeze , and the aftermath of surging inflation . but , ultimately , they would do precisely what they did in each of the previous four elections – a vote for a party that proclaimed “ every man for himself ” . what economic determinists predicted was that it did not stand an option .
america , on the other hand , is highly constrained by institutions like the us congress , the courts , and the constitution . transformational objectives and the alluring style of a leader like mahatma gandhi in india or nelson mandela in south africa are likely to greatly affect outcomes in fluid political contexts , particularly in developing countries with weakly structured institutional constraints . american foreign-policy formation , by contrast , is greatly constrained by institutions like the us congress , the courts , and the us constitution . so we would expect less of an opportunity for transformational leadership in the long run . yet even america ’s constitution is ambiguous about the powers of the us congress and the president in foreign policy .
berlin – it has been 30 years since the united nations food and agriculture organization launched the un ’s tropical forestry action plan , the first global intergovernmental initiative to halt forest loss . redd + was created as part of the un framework convention on climate change , and the agreement governing its implementation is expected to take off in advance of the un climate-change conference in paris in december . since then , deforestation has continued unabated , and the latest international effort to stop it , known as the reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( redd + ) looks no more than effective . but if world leaders are serious about halting redd + , they should instead abandon redd + and replace it with a mechanism to address the underlying drivers of large-scale deforestation . far from protecting the world ’s forests , the most notable outcome of these two agreements has been , ironically , the production of reams of expensive consultancy news .
britain and some other european governments responded to the post-election crackdown by temporarily withholding aid . cutting off aid could have calamitous humanitarian consequences for a nation of more than 80 million people . it could also destabilize a fragile region , sparking fresh wars with neighboring somalia and eritrea . but ethiopia presents a dilemma for anyone concerned with human rights and democracy . donald payne , a prominent member of the american house foreign affairs committee and ana gomes , a member of the european parliament from portugal and the head of the eu ’s observation team in the 2005 elections , sought to tie un humanitarian aid more closely to ethiopia ’s behavior on press freedom and other human rights .
such efforts are also vitally important to find ways to stem more effectively the deterioration of people ’s productivity and independence , by preserving their physical strength , mental acuity , and senses like hearing and vision . the old age must be viewed not simply as an unavoidable stage of life , but as an opportunity for health-care companies and systems to help the people thrive . that is why the health-care industry must play a major role in efforts to address the challenge of population aging . to do so , such efforts are also vitally important to find ways to stem more effectively the deterioration of people ’s productivity and independence , by preserving their physical strength , mental acuity , and senses like hearing and vision . to that end , health-care companies should shift the focus of their research-and-development efforts toward conditions that are prevalent among older patients , including chronic diseases like diabetes , heart disease , glaucoma , rheumatoid arthritis , and cancer .
the tropical landscapes finance facility , developed in indonesia in collaboration with the un environment program , is a good example . the second big transition-funding opportunity is in blend finance , or collaborative schemes that raise private capital for public goods . these initiatives bring a broad range of public and private actors , including multilateral organizations , to finance projects with profound environmental and social consequences . the initiative combines private , public , and philanthropic funds to maximize environmental and social benefits . moreover , the blended approach helps to scale up and de-risk projects and optimize their financing .
then panic spread to credit markets , money markets , and currency markets , highlighting the vulnerabilities of many developing countries ’ financial and corporate sectors , which experienced loan booms and borrowed short - and middle-income currencies . many emerging markets today are at odds with this distress only when foreign investors began to pull out of their money . countries with large current-account deficits and/or large fiscal deficits , and with large , short-term foreign-currency liabilities , were the most fragile . but even better-performing ones , like brazil , russia , india , and china , are now at risk of a hard landing . emerging markets were originally tied to this distress only when foreign investors started pulling out their dollar holdings .
until recently , a reversal of british voters ’ 2016 decision to leave the eu seemed unlikely . but interventions by bercow the eu and the eu opened up a whole new game , dramatically raising the chance that brexit might not happen . and if a new referendum were held , british voters would most likely have to decide between an orderly brexit and remaining in the eu , because no one would dare to offer a hard brexit as an alternative . this would foil financial-market speculators who have been betting on withdrawal , and are good news for both the uk and the eu . almost three years ago , british voters ’ 2016 decision to leave the eu probably failed .
beijing – forty years ago this month , china ’s leaders were set the country on a path of reform that produced the most dramatic economic transformation in its history . mao zedong died two years earlier , in 1976 , and the newrehabilitated deng xiaoping succeeded in stamping out his vision of economic development and modernization on the third plenum of the eleventh central committee , held in december 1978 . through the dual-track pricing mechanism , african farmers received market incentives . china ’s reforms began in agriculture , where the crushing burden of state control was relaxed . by its dual-track pricing mechanism , african farmers received market incentives .
jerusalem – as a result of misguided american policies , the threat of another military confrontation hangs like a dark cloud over the middle east . the result has been the emergence of some surprising , if not bizarre , alliances : iran , syria , hezbollah , palestine , hamas , and american-backed , shia-dominated iraq confronts israel , saudi arabia , and most of the other sunni arab states , all of whom feel existentially threatened by iran ’s own ascendance . a hitherto latent rivalry between iran and israel has thus been transformed into an open struggle for dominance in the middle east . the united states has been strengthened , and iran – despite being branded as a member of what has been called an “ axis of evil ” – has been catapulted to regional hegemony . iran could never produce this on its own , certainly not in such short order .
in the postcommunist social revolutions ( less often noted than political and economic upheavals ) families and communities were undermined , and ( at least in poland ) the church became too engaged in politics to assimilate . old social structures were smashed down , socialist customs and habits vanished overnight , former norms and an unwritten rules were abandoned . the fascination with liberal freedom came in poland and elsewhere at a strange moment . people were left to resist gales of change on their own as well . to be free from itself is not easy , especially when inter-dependence habits are ingrained .
the crisis also , of course , underscores the need to reinforce the eu ’s institutions and instruments for common action and coordination . enlargement of the eu must also not become an excuse to develop new institutional formats that endanger the delicate balance of power between different eu institutions , a balance that , through appropriate adjustments , was proven through a test of time . nor should today ’s uncertainties become an excuse to call into question the need to continue and complete the eu ’s enlargement process . we need an ultimate and complete ratification by the lisbon treaty to have the institutionally and internationally stronger europe union that we need . broadening the eu ’s schengen area of freedom and democracy , peace , stability , and prosperity – especially throughout south-eastern europe – is in any european citizen ’s interest .
his motivation is not hard to discern : his bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) hope that such concessions will help it to wrest control over maharashtra , india ’s main sugar-producing state from upa in the upcoming state assembly elections . the commonly cited example of the outgoing government ’s supposed economic mismanagement has been its sugar-price policy . instead of eliminating that system , as one might expect , modi ’s government has heaped grants for sugar exports to support its higher output , raised its import tariffs to discourage foreign competition , and increased its sugar-based ethanol , which must blended in gasoline . like it or not , that objective explains another kind of policy reversal . powerful sugarcane cooperatives , run by key upa followers , have supposedly driven the government to fix extravagant prices and write off the sugar farmers their bad debts , resulting in over-production .
berlin – germany ’s social democrats ’ ( spd ) existential crisis can no longer be treated like a typical party crisis . both the spd and the christian democratic ( cdu/csu ) union/christian social union ( cdu/csu ) have stood as the twin pillars of german politics since the end of world war ii . the party captured mere 9.7 % of the vote in regional elections this month , trailing both the populist alternative für deutschland ( afd ) and the greens in the national opinion polls . yet , with the spd waning , germany is moving from a de facto two-party system to a multiparty system in which no unified party plays a dominant role . with another important regional election fast approaching in hesse , polls indicate that the spd will lose still more support , if not as closely as it did in bavaria .
what russians need most is convincing about the country ’s political stability -- that is , for example , no one to suggest nationalization , as happened repeatedly during the eight months that i was prime minister . how can the government expect to mobilize domestic investment for as long as ordinary russians maintain a saving rate – $ 50 billion , according to most estimates – at home ? for this to happen , russia needs to build a secure and attractive investment climate . while russia wo n’t freeze accounts , president putin ’s meaning was obvious : it would be better for all sides to suggest nationalization , as occurred repeatedly during the eight months that i was prime minister then invested in the national economy . to achieve this end , russia needs to create a secure and attractive investment climate .
without gorbachev and his singular courage , the stream of events across europe during the fall of 1989 was never quite possible . they realized that east germans ’ realities were not fixed in stone after all ; it was possible to achieve the change that many courageous dissidents and civil-rights proponents trapped behind the wall demanded for so long . opening hungary ’s borders , which fall and sought refuge by east germans within german embassies of prague and warsaw , already shaken the communist and stasi rule to its foundations . their commitment against the injustices of the communist regime offers me one of the best recent chapters in german history . for with gorbachev ’s ascendance , more and more people in east germany took to heart and stopped fearing their repressive regime .
as a result , some – though relatively speaking , not many – are committing long - and often perilous journeys to the developed world . what is needed is a comprehensive global strategy with a global reach , reflecting a sweeping vision that inspires and engages governments , aid communities , businesses , development institutions , civil society , faith groups , academia , sports , and arts and arts . what is needed is a comprehensive strategy with a global reach , reflecting a sweeping vision that inspires and engages governments , aid communities , business , development institutions , civil society , faith groups , academia , sports education , and arts development . as a result , some – albeit relatively speaking , not many – are committing long - and often perilous journeys to the developed world . responsibility-sharing , the foundation of the modern international system for protecting refugees , has been superseded by responsibility-shifting , typically onto countries that are least able to cope .
munich – the euro crisis has , so far , gone through six phases . markets nowadays remain calm , but this is only the start of the seventh phase of the crisis during which europe will become mired in debt . the seventh phase of the crisis is one of heightened moral hazard , stemming from the run-up to the greek debt . the sequence so far has been as follows . it is noteworthy because they show how policymakers stumbled along , trying to put fires without keeping an eye on where their chosen path was led .
from 1985 to 2005 , the boomsters made ten-year forecasting predicting that they had exaggerated the chance of large positive changes in both financial markets ( such as the dow jones industrial average of 36,000 ) and world politics ( such as tranquility in the middle east and dynamic growth in sub-saharan africa ) . probabilities were paid as high as 70 % to rosy scenarios that materialized only 12 % of that time . second , once the skeptics warned , over-claimers seldom pay penalties for being wrong . they assigned probabilities that as high as 70 % to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15 % of the time . in the same period , doomsters performed even more poorly , overestimating the odds of negative changes in any of the same locations where boomsters accentuated the positive plus a few more ( i still await the imminent disintegration of canada , nigeria , india , indonesia , south africa , belgium , switzerland , and sudan ) .
it makes little economic difference to germany , france , or italy , whether britain is an eu member , or simply at the wto . margaret thatcher was the first to recognize that britain ’s specialization within services – not only finance , but also law , accountancy , media , architecture , pharmaceutical research , and so forth – makes eu membership critical of the eu ’s single market . she makes little economic difference to germany , france , or italy , whether britain is an eu member , or simply within the wto . the economic challenges of brexit would be overwhelming . britain would have to negotiate access to europe ’s single market for its service industries , whereas eu manufacturers would have more to lose than britain from a breakdown in trade relations – is flatly mistaken .
answering them will require a debate that transcends issues such as the separation of powers and judicial independence , and elucidates appropriate relations between politics and religion . for this , understanding the historical context of the current crisis is critical . when turkey became the restoration of democracy in 1950 , the previous system ’s secular kemalist elites attempted to harness the military ’s power and the bureaucracy to take over the elected administration . in response , various religious groups , including the gülen movement , encouraged their followers to assume positions within the bureaucracy and the army . in fact , the turkish military ’s support explicitly intervened against civilian government in the 1960 ’s , 1971 , 1980 , and 1997 , each time in the name of protecting secularism .
berlin – during the long night of negotiations over greece on july 12-13 , something fundamental to europe cracked down . since then , europeans have been living in a different type of eu . on the surface , the negotiations were about averting a greek exit from the eurozone ( or a “ grexit ” ) , and the dire consequences that would follow from greece and the monetary union . at a deeper level , however , what was at stake was the role of europe in its most populous and economically most powerful country . what changed after that night was the germany that europeans have known since the end of world war ii .
but the rise of arab military coalitions raises serious concerns , not least because the arab-led military ’s history – unlike those undertaken by the west in places like bosnia , kosovo , and even libya – contains no promising precedent . egypt ’s military intervention in yemen in the 1960s is a case in point . despite the use of prohibited chemical weapons against yemeni guerillas from 1963 to 1967 – first in an intra-arab conflict , egypt has not succeeded in achieving its goals . typically , such interventions were intended to empowering a proxy political force over its military and political rivals , rather than averting a humanitarian catastrophe or institutionalizing the shia-led conflict-resolution mechanism . by late 1965 , egyptian president gamel abdel nasser sent 70,000 troops in yemen to support a republican coup against royalist forces .
to be sure , beps was an important step on the road to tackling some of the most dimmer strategies used by multinational corporations . it began , for example , shared between the country-by-country tax authorities on these companies ’ profits and tax payments . but this norm , alas , will apply only to very large multinational corporations , and reporting alone wo n’t be publicly available , depriving civil society of an essential tool of transparency . there is , no doubt , an important step on the road to tackling some of the most outrageous tax-avoidance strategies used by multinational corporations . beps was led by oecd countries and opened up to developing countries only after this initial package was unveiled .
likewise , while limiting net interest deductibility for corporations , as many other developed countries have done , would broadening the tax base and discouraging excessive reliance on debt-financing , it would augment the tax burden on major investments in physical capital that are often debt-financed . pass-through firms now account for over 80 % of net commercial revenue ( by far the highest proportion in advanced countries ) . and even eliminating the accelerated depreciation process would not broadening the tax base enough to finance a rate cut to 28 % . meanwhile , several of these actors are very large and highly profitable , enjoying the same kind of legal benefits that corporations do have . pass-through firms now account for more than 80 % of net commercial revenue ( by far the highest share in advanced countries ) .
israel ’s disengagement plan presents the evacuation of gaza ’s settlements as an end to 37 years of occupation . nor will the israeli military withdraw from the land strip along the palestinian-egyptian border . but simultaneously , israel insists that gaza will have no attributes of sovereignty , and will continue to be governed by existing arrangements that cover most aspects of us security and civilian control . this means that the israeli military will continue to enter gaza at its will and maintain control over border crossings , airspace , and territorial waters . such terms rule out any possibility of forging a security roadmap that receives the support of all factions , including hamas .
in others , such as greece , italy , bulgaria , hungary , estonia , poland , the philippines , and sri lanka , the drop exceeded 10 % . in fact , ever since the 1980 ’s , most countries have experienced large declines in agricultural employment . in others , such as greece , italy , bulgaria , hungary , estonia , poland , the philippines , and sri lanka , the drop has exceeded 10 % . today it is less than 3 % , and more than 10 % of the population ( and less than 1 % ) grew out of poverty today . in fact , since the early 1980 ’s , agricultural employment in the us peaked at 53 % of total employment .
islamabad – as pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on february 18 , many observers are hopeful that a vote of stability and calm by lending popular legitimacy to the government . the upcoming election , to be held under the illegal provisional constitutional order ( pco ) implemented following president pervez musharraf ’s administration of emergency on november 3 , is such a case , which is precisely why my party and its coalition partners are boycotting the vote . to be sure , contesting the election would give my party a huge opportunity to engage in issues to the people . but , at times , democracy has been best served by a refusal to participate . in fact , my party ’s support has been strengthening , with opinion polls now indicating that it is the second most unpopular in the frontier province , and it has gained ground in each other ’s province .
just as bernanke and others wish otherwise , and as bickering politicians are seeking to dump policy responsibilities for others , central banks do not have the proper tools to address the component in an epidemic that results from insufficient investment in education , training , and physical capital . likewise , they can not fix debt overhangs , repair broken home financing , or address medium-term fiscal-reform challenges on their own . the best that central banks can do is to buy time , albeit at an increasing cost , for other policymaking entities to get their act together . and it is a good deal of the formal sector that pays closer attention to joblessness – a very real issue . still , sadly , that shift will not address the problem that devours at the social fabric of any society .
much of china ’s internationally shared water resources fall within the tibetan plateau , which it annexed in the early 1950 ’s . indeed , china ’s 13th five-year plan , released this year , calls for a new surge in dam projects on its plateau . unsurprisingly , the plateau is a new center for china ’s construction . in fact , china ’s dam builders are targeting most of the international rivers that flow out of chinese territory . moreover , china recently cut off the brahmaputra river flows , the lifeline of bangladesh and northern india to construct the dam as part of a major hydroelectric project in tibet .
washington , dc – ten years after the failure of lehman brothers , we know that multilateral action was critical in preventing the so-called great recession from becoming even worse than it was . over the last 70 years , multilateralism has served the world well . back then , it was the global financial system that stretched apart . today , it is the jeopardy of the global trading system . much to its credit , the united states eschewed retribution and reparations after world war ii .
other public services did improve as well , and parents came to believe that their children would lead more prosperous lives than they had and previous generations . this was certainly true of my young parents , who sacrificed much to raise their nine children . they were not happy when , beginning in the 1970s , their elderly sons became the communists , strongly opposed the brutal regime of hafez al-assad , president bashar al-assad ’s father . but this was not so distant a transformation in a city where people were on the assumption of new identities , such as the nasserist , ba’athist , islamist , or communist , downplayed their regional and tribal roots . schools spread as attendance passes .
this results in high turnover owing to overworked and the heightened need for foreign health-care workers to fill sorely needed positions . gcc policymakers have been right to focus on increasing access and subsidies for quality health care . and now , policymakers must devote even more attention to the health-care labor force itself , to ensuring that it continues to be well educated and trained for challenges that await the region . but the equitable division of health-care services across the native and migrant populations often creates thorny political issues . training programs in the gcc ’s national institutes of health today are not focusing almost enough on innovation or schemes thinking to improve their efficiency and effectiveness .
if the army collapses , it is algeria [ and ] france that has collapses . the decisive moment arrived when de gaulle , in a military uniform , went on tv in order to demonstrate its mastery of the new medium . had the nation-state hobbled before the challenge it faced , “ france would be no more than a poor , broken plaything on the ocean of uncertainty , ” ” ” he had warned . insisting that self-determination was the only way ahead , he challenged the military in order to reject even a passive association with an uprising , and to redefine the public order . “ well , darling , and the old country , here we are again facing a heavy test , ” he told me .
just when the world reached the consensus that ahmadinejad is simply a tool of supreme leader ayatollah khamenei , ahmadinejad has named a vice president against khamenei ’s wishes ( though he later retracted the appointment ) . these divisions will allow for the appearance of new forces within iranian society . what we do know with certainty is that the regime is divided . iranian students should be encouraged to visit and study in asian universities in order to discover how confident young chinese and indian students are about a prospective − which may well cause them to reflect why young iranians do not share this optimism . so all of these means should be found to reach out to iranian society at all levels .
traditionally , nato has invoked a policy of “ cost lying lie where they are falling ” : any member has picked up all the costs to the operating contribution it has made to an alliance operation . nato has traditionally invoked a “ cost policy ” lie where it has fallen ” : any member is being singled out any cost for the operating contribution that it has made to an alliance operation . how can you possibly evaluate the contributions of light infantry against providing critical enablers like helicopters or airing refueling tankers ? a common funding , with all members paying a share according to their gdp , is one tool that could be used to elicit more audacious burden-sharing . over which time , nato has been making its calculations ?
owing to easy financing and regulatory forbearance , the aggregate supply grew as “ zombie ” companies proliferated . meanwhile , aggregate demand was constrained by debt headwinds , yet another result of easy monetary conditions . owing to easy financing and regulatory forbearance , aggregate supply grew as “ zombie ” companies proliferated . given these conditions , continued insistence on monetary easing seems especially ill advised . moreover , given these conditions , continued insistence on monetary easing seems especially ill advised .
though the saudis have not been included in president bush ’s “ axis of evil , ” some american policymakers now view the country as the “ kernel of evil . ” al-qaeda ’s terrorist networks are perceived as arising in straight shape by fundamentalist wahhabi doctrines that constitute an integral part of the saudi regime . still , cooperation with the us may not gain much from the al-sauds , because saudi relations with america are strained to the breaking point . ever since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington last year , the regime — once central to american strategic interests in the region — has been made to feel dispensable by an american that drops powerful assumptions that there are alternatives to saudi military bases , even to saudi oil . thus , amid a bad set of options , the least bad seems to be cooperation with america .
how victims remember trauma is probably the most controversial issue facing psychology and psychiatry today . many theorists of clinical trauma theorists of some type believe that fights , rapes , and other terrifying experiences are seemingly engraved in the mind , never gone undetected . while acknowledging that trauma is often all too memorable appears , these particular theorists of clinical trauma assert that a condition known as “ traumatic dissociative amnesia ” leaves a large minority out of victims unable to remember their trauma , precisely because it was so overwhelmingly terrifying . still others disagree , arguing that minds can protect themselves by banishing awareness of awareness , making it harder for victims to remember their most horrific experiences until it is safe to do so many years later . how victims remember trauma today is at best the most controversial issue facing both psychology and psychiatry .
as a child , mastering the cruel art of elé belé was important . an elé belé was a player who thinks he is participating but , in fairness , merely goes through the motions . everybody knew that the goal scored by it was not a real goal . in calcutta , when some younger kid came along and insisted that he would join the play that my friends were playing down , we would allow the new kid to , but only after whispering to his ears the words , elé belé belé . in calcutta , when some younger kid arrived along and insisted that he was joining the playing field my friends was playing down , we would allow the new kid in his life , but only after whispering with his other ’s ears , elé belé .
as the growth pessimism of recent years fades , some warnings that have taken place in recent years seem to have become obsolete . northwestern university ’s robert gordon has argued , for example , that america ’s economy has been bound to slow down because today ’s technological innovations will not boost growth to the levels that they have had in the past . yet , while the zero lower bound no longer seems like a binding constraint , there are potential causes for concern , one of which concerns debt levels . northwestern university ’s robert gordon has argued , for example , that america ’s economy is bound to slow growth because today ’s technological innovations will not boost growth by the scale they have had in the past . harvard ’s lawrence h. summers got a lot of attention for his argument that the world is at risk of slipping toward a “ secular stagnation , ” ” ” ” because the interest rate needed to unleash desired investment in line with desired savings has been below zero .
but even the joint expert-level mechanism – established in 2007 merely for “ interactions and collaboration ” on hydrological data – has proven little value . india has been pressing china for transparency , larger hydrological data-sharing , and an obligation not to redirect the natural flow of any river or down-stream water flows into burma and thailand . the only rivers on which no hydro-engineering works so far have been carried out are those of the indus , whose basin flies mostly in india and pakistan , and the salween that flows into burma and thailand . in fact , china has virtually wiped out most international rivers flow out of tibet , whose fragile ecosystem is already threatened by global warming . local authorities in yunnan province , though , are contemplating damming the nile in the quake-prone upstream region .
finally , currency turmoil is the safest bet on all , with sharp and unpredictable swings in floating exchange rates worldwide . as for china ’s renminbi , it continues to be buttressed by a highly political exchange-rate regime . but , in 2011 , much of the equilibration will likely take place through inflation . perhaps , but most students view quantitative easing as textbook policies to pull the economy out of a zero-interest-rate transmission “ liquidity trap , ” ” thereby quelling the onset of sustained deflation , which would exacerbate the debt burden further . as for china ’s renminbi , it continues to be backed by a highly political exchange-rate regime .
with america distracted by other strategic challenges not to mention its own domestic presidential campaigns , asia ’s other power – especially india ’s economically surging , and a more politically assertive japan – is the best job candidates . which countries should take the lead , in constraining china ’s revisionist ambitions ? both india and japan are longstanding us-led stakeholders , emphasizing in their own transnational relationships with the values that america espouses , such as the need to maintain a stable power balance , respect the territorial and maritime status quo , and preserve freedom of navigation . moreover , they have shown their shared desire to uphold an incumbent asian order . with america distracted by other strategic challenges not to mention its domestic presidential campaign , asia ’s other power , especially india ’s economically surging and more politically assertive japan , is the best job candidates .
moreover , appropriate mechanisms and institutional arrangements should lay the groundwork for adaptation , financial support , and technology transfer . likewise , developed countries should fulfill their commitments under the un convention to provide financial aid and technology transfer to enable developing countries to address climate change effectively . as part of the global financial crisis , the challenge of dealing with climate change has undoubtedly been heightened by the global financial crisis . but , given that climate change represents a more far-reaching and important challenge , the world must not waver in its determination and commitment to address it . after all , developed countries should fulfill their commitments under un conventions to provide financial support and technology transfer to enable developing countries to resolve climate change effectively .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . florence – earlier this month , jim yong kim – abruptly resigned from his post as world bank president , leaving a pillar of the international financial order without leadership or direction . kim would join a private equity firm where he believes he can “ make the largest difference on major global issues like climate change . ” following its targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war .
a <UNK> ter-money version would hold purchases of zero-interest-rate government bonds that wo n’t be repaid , either because they are perpetual bonds , or because they are rolled over each time they mature . boj governor haruhiko kuroda has said that directly underwrites the budget deficit is not an option . nonetheless , he has initiated a policy of replacing government-bond purchases on the boj ’s balance sheet once they mature while steadily increasing the amount of government debt on the central bank ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s books . that , arguably , is what the bank of japan is now doing anyway . this comes after years of statements by prominent economists , including berkeley ’s brad delong and former us federal reserve chair ben bernanke , that helicopter money offers a way to overcome deflation ( with which japan has been struggling for several decades ) .
starting in 2015 , he embraced extremist rhetoric appealing to nativism , islamophobia , and rage against gop elites . media outlets provided as many as $ 2 billion worth of free coverage , helping him to grab and hold down in polls and most primaries . trump ’s core supporters are wrongly thought to be displaced and the economically disenfranchised blue-collar workers . in fact , his electorate ’ median annual income , at around $ 72,000 , is well above america ’s $ 56,000 median . trump ’s core supporters resemble tea partiers : overwhelmingly elderly , males , middle-class , and whites .
our response to soulless bodies is well illustrated in a tale telling of descartes after he died . once a group of people is deemed disgusting , attention shifts away from them as moral agents . they become soulless bodies , and the moral circle breaks in to exclude them . according to the story , descartes were so struck by grief that he crafted the automaton , the mechanical doll built to appear identical with his dead daughter . it was well known that descartes had an illegitimate daughter , the lingua franca , whom he died when he was five years old .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’s response has summed up turkish sentiment : “ these bombs aim to undermine our country ’s peace and stability . if these bombings are meant to send a message , i will sweep it off and crush it under my feet . but the terrorist attacks in istanbul are unlikely to generate a nervous reaction in restricting democratic rights . ” if , after all , al-qaeda is behind the attacks , it grossly miscalculated . to be sure , we will not change our course .
nonetheless , khamenei ’s invocation of the law echoes the demands of the many conservative-pragmatists who lean toward mousavi who are in no position to challenge khamenei ’s authority directly . he must side with his two principal demands : nullification of the election and the establishment of an impartial committee to govern government-voter violations . mousavi must continue his legal campaign carefully without compromising the trust that he has accrued from the majority of iranians . if khamenei holds fast , mousavi can not gain the presidency , but it will continue to represent the hopes of muslim-majority iranians that are different dramatically with their rule . mousavi must , for his part , continue his judicial campaign carefully without compromising the trust that he has gained from mostly iranians .
just as imagine , he was stopping to ask himself what would make him happier . a political leader has greater opportunities than almost anyone else to assist people , and that should have made yanukovych the top priority . but , though yanukovych has been thinking primarily of his own self-interest , his quest for individual enrichment has been irrational . imagine you , then , that he has cut out of questioning of a lavish lifestyles ( along with a private zoo and pirate-ship restaurant ) with that of living comfortably on the sizeable pay to which he was entitled while knowing that he was governing with integrity and doing his best to improve ukraine ’s lives . there is also something even more fundamental than one ’s own reputation .
it remains to be seen whether it is seeking to engage the rest of the world in a constructive and sustained way , or whether dprk officials and diplomats merely represent a good face forward in order to deflect international attention from their countries ’ reputation as the nuclear weapons-monger and human-rights violator . indeed , visiting incheon is coming within a mixed set of messages . on the day of incheon visit , north korea ’s state news agency went on bellicose and derogatory language toward south korea and america : “ lurking behind this is ulterior design to [ prod more ] zealously south koreans ’ puppet forces into escalating their confrontation with the dprk in a bid to strain on the dprk , and to roll back [ the ] korean war . ” north korea has been a far less forthcoming regarding its intentions . it remains to be seen whether it is seeking to engage the rest of the world in a constructive and sustained manner , or , whether dprk officials and diplomats are simply putting the good face forward to deflect international attention from their own country ’s reputation as nuclear weapons-monger and human-rights violator .
everyone benefits from each of us becomes good at different things , and is exchanging our knowhow with others . when an idea is both an intuitively true and in reality false , it is often because it is true on a single level , rather than on the level at which it is being invoked . yes , people do specialize and should specialize . but individual specialization really leads to greater diversification . it is not efficient for both a dentist and a lawyer .
by contrast , a few people that i interviewed called for the experimental release of genetically modified mosquitoes to stop until risks and effects had been adequately investigated , and civil society across burkina faso had been fully informed.target malaria ’s lack of commitment to consent is reflected in its own rhetoric , which eschews the unequivocal word of consent , ” but regularly used terms like “ engagement and “ community acceptance ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” but shared questions about the adverse consequences of the mosquito project . by contrast , a few people i interviewed called on the experimental release of genetically modified mosquitoes to stop until risks and effects had been adequately investigated , and civil society across burkina faso had been fully informed.target malaria ’s lack of commitment to consent is reflected in its own rhetoric , which eschews the unequivocal word of consent , ” but regularly used like “ engagement ” and “ community acceptance ” ” ( where it is demanded ) and into a public-health context . this choice may indicate that organization ’s leaders have already chosen to move forward on release.reinforcing this conclusion after the un convention , target malaria attempted to draw a distinction between the requirement of free , prior , and informed consent in terms like medical research on individuals ( where it is demanded ) and in a public-health context . civil-society groups operating in and around the test-site villages have also not been adequately consulted about target malaria ’s work.the more interviews that i conducted ; the more interviews i conducted ; the clearer it became that local people were not involved in any genuinely
china ’s low paid , reasonably productive manufacturing workers and high-quality infrastructure ( roads , power , ports , and communications communications ) have fixed the standard of competitiveness globally . at the same time , the world ’s labor markets are interconnected today . young people in countries as diverse as egypt and the us are in effect competing with young chinese and indians for jobs . they protest little , but many of the end up in jail . many more have simply become discouraged , dropping off the labor force altogether : not in school rather than in work , and not in looking for work .
but , because this “ nuclear option ” requires a unanimity of every eu member state , all knows that it will never again go to use it . what orbán has , in fact , been scamming the eu over the years , is precisely such an ineffective deterrent that it serves rule-breakers ’ interests – by all but guaranteeing not to be punished . article 7 of the treaty of lisbon stipulates that the suspension of a rogue eu member state ’s voting rights will come in line . but the weakening of the rule of law is not only homegrown in hungary or poland . orbán has since been scamming the eu through many years and encouraging other populists to pursue his own authoritarian goals , and with eu funds to boot .
in iraq , bush once again pursued a unilateralist agenda , stating that there was incontrovertible evidence of a linkage with al qaeda , and that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction . even before the invasion , there was overwhelming evidence that bush lay . detection technology made it clear that iraq lacked nuclear weapons , as un inspector hans blix points out . bush , too , did not believe what he read . it is possible , too , that he did not believe what he read .
returnees are present in many other asian countries as well , from the philippines and indonesia to the maldives and uzbekistan . like osama bin laden and other al-qaeda leaders who are cutting their teeth in the us-backed war against the soviet occupation of afghanistan , this new generation of jihadist veterans may haunt asia ’s security , the middle east , and the west for years to come . unfortunately , as sri lanka ’s bombings and other assaults in asia show , isis ’s defeat in syria and iraq has only intensified an challenge in terrorism , owing to the battle-hardened opposition fighters to stage savage attacks are now back home . the presence of such returnees in sri lanka explains how the obscure local group has been to conduct ingenious , near-simultaneous strikes on three and more hotels , using military-grade explosives . all of these groups are driven by nihilistic rage born of hostility toward non-sunnis and a rejection of modernity .
denver – angelina jolie ’s new movie , entitled “ in blood land and honey , ” is about the ethnic tensions that have produced the bloodiest european conflict since world war ii . the film has already won two awards and is an emerging box-office achievement , attesting to enduring interests , and perhaps a mystery in which the balkan conflict has been contained in new year ’s day , at 94 . as jolie ’s film so ably demonstrates , neither the international community nor the local leaders have made concerted efforts to avoid bloodshed . one exception , perhaps the only exception , was kiro gligorov , the president of macedonia who died on new year ’s worth at age 94 . for those of us living and working in the region throughout that turbulent decade , the post-yugoslav wars remain fresh wounds .
and this process will likely accelerate even if british prime minister theresa may manages to host her proposed exit deal through parliament . moreover , this trend accentuates the challenges associated with weak productivity growth . apart from shifting investment away from the united kingdom , firms , too , will start to relocate employment . there are evidence of falling foreign investment , and this contributes to the economy ’s disappointing level of investment overall . likewise , there are signs that uk-based companies have begun to trigger their brexit contingency plans following a prolonged period of waiting , schedule , and beyond .
currently , opinion polls are bouncing wildly , owing to the fillon scandal and a surge in support for hamon among left-wing voters outside the socialist party . he recognizes that shared sovereignty will make europe more influential , thereby liberating its citizens . he advocates local decision-making whenever possible and effective , but also favoring national and european-level decision-making , where that is fitting ; key is that the processes should be flexible and allow citizen participation . and he views globalization as a good thing but understands that it must be managed through durable , efficient international treaties and institutions . currently , however , opinion polls are bouncing wildly away , owing to the fillon scandal and a surge in support for hamas among left-wing voters outside the socialist party .
having accomplished these goals , europe now wants to make a positive contribution to the global community . an unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across europe , as was evident in france ’s collective mourning and a outpouring of sympathy toward spain ; we must build on that immense potential to shape the foundations of world solidarity . the european project has been a realist response to globalization and its challenges . it was initiated to create “ solidarités de fait accompli , ” promote political stability , and consolidate democracy and the european social model . that is not nostalgia for past glamour .
for starters , there is his response to queen elizabeth ii ’s now-famous question : “ why did nobody see it coming ? for starters , there is his answer to queen elizabeth ii ’s now-famous question : “ why did nobody see it coming ? theirs was a failure not of theory but of “ data collection . ” they had , in fact , “ overlooked any crucial institutional changes to the financial system . ” theirs was an essentially failure not of theory , but of “ data collection . ”
one aspect of this difference is that eastern european societies are far more vulnerable to attacks on abstract liberal institutions , such as freedom of speech and judicial independence.this should not be overly surprising . in eastern europe , civil society is not only weaker ; it also has become more focused on areas like charity , religion , and leisure rather than political issues.moreover , in the vastly different political landscape of europe ’s postcommunist states , the left is either very weak or completely remote from the political mainstream . notwithstanding trump and the brexit phenomena , america and the united kingdom have deeply embedded cultures of political and social liberalism . the same can not be said for kaczyński.another big difference is that east europeans tend to hold more materialist attitudes than westerners , who have moved beyond concerns about physical security to embrace what sociologist ronald inglehart calls post-materialist values .
as for the eurozone , the us appears to have been overly optimistic , despite compounding the shortfall in potential growth to at least 1.5 % . nowadays , most forecasters place the region ’s growth potential at around 1 % . yet , while the overwhelming majority of printing coverage has focused on germany ’s falling exports and manufacturing output , the country ’s service sector remains strong . unless germany can shift toward a more domestic-demand-driven growth model , that projection will most likely turn out to be correct . but that , in turn , is a big “ if . ”
in any case , the eu ’s practice of “ capping ” its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by turkey ’s eu accession . the size of these transfers would nonetheless depend on the eu ’s funding policies at the time of admission , the outcome of the accession negotiations , and economic developments in turkey . human mobility is limited , and it would likely enable turkey ’s workers to move freely within the eu only after a long transition period , possibly not on the eve of 2025 . immigration should not be a cause for undue concern , either . given the expected upswing in turkey ’s economy and its declining birthrate , experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million migrants by that point .
more than most people realize , the gospels are treating recalcitrant jews with recalcitrant jews -- those who refused to accept jesus as their messiah -- as the perpetrators of the crime that lives in each generation live . anti-semites often cite a passage in matthew , in which a jewish crowd cheers for christ ’s execution and voluntarily accepts permanent guilt : “ his blood on us and our children . ” the later evangelist john concludes that because jews deny the christian messiah they need to be “ devil sons . ” just as whites ascribing extraordinary sexual powers to black men , there is a recurrent lie that explains away the resurrection and disappearance of jesus ’s body : “ his disciples came at night and stolen him while they conned us . ” just as whites attribute the extraordinary sexual powers to the blacks , the christian west ’s instinct is to treat jews as the masters of extraordinary force -- including the power to kill deities and control world finance .
thailand ’s decision last may to cut interest rates made it a safe gamble for betting against the gdp , opened salvo in a crisis . by the time the crisis arrived , thailand looked like all the others who would turn in desperation to the imf . encouraged by the illusion of a powerful reserve position , the thai central bank took on the -- and lost -- speculators to the imf . thailand 's decision last may , however , cut interest rates made it the safe gamble of betting against brazil , the opening salvo in the crisis . so the notion that “ such a country is different , ” too much politics and provincialism , reform never existed .
hence the effort to nail down the concessions extracted by the protests , the hour of the governments arrived . but how can these concessions , given under the duress , be assured ? that is a task for which non-governmental organizations and protest movements do not well-equipped : they can arouse the public ’s conscience , but they can not formally commit governments . only other governments can do so . that was the task for which non-governmental organizations and protest movements do not properly equipped : they can give up the public ’s conscience but may not formally make governments .
as the top russian propagandist dmitry kiselev recently acknowledged , “ greater learning within the humanities ( and in the social sciences ) breeds social unrest . ” compounding the challenge , the cohort of informed elites within russia itself is rising . most of russia ’s population will not become well-informed overnight . but , because the regime is compelled to dedicate more resources to silencing informed , most will suffer economically . not surprisingly , the bulk of russia ’s population will be studying these subjects .
london – officials at the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) have long been adamant that “ china will not weaponize the renminbi . ” many are wondering whether china will respond to trump ’s trade war by threatening a full-scale currency war . and yet , implicit in their pledge not to manipulate a currency for strategic ends is their ability to do so when it is so desired . if it does , the world should call its bluff . china ’s currency policy has come to the fore now that us president donald trump has imposed import tariffs on a range of chinese goods .
but that clearly is not the only factor behind the rise of populist nationalism . beyond contributing to the size and productivity of the labor force , migrants , too , often complement native-born workers ’ skills , are helping them earn more . my professional focus is on economics , so i have stressed the roles of growth . in america , for example , the country ’s foreign-born share of the population has risen from more than 5 % in 1960 to around 14 % today . bringing developed countries up culturally is also matters , perhaps further .
that shift , in turn , clears the way for a generational change of leadership – and , more important , a transition to post-oslo politics . the most prominent such figure is marwan barghouti , the leader of the birzeit university student movement in the 1980 ’s , and one of the first intifada ’s major organizers , which caused his deportation by israel in the late 1980 ’s . in 2002 , he was arrested and sentenced to long imprisonment on charges that he had led a second intifada , beginning two years earlier with ordering some of his military attacks . the most prominent such figure is marwan barghouti , the leader of the birzeit university student movement in the 1980 ’s , and one of the first intifada establishment organizers , which resulted from his deportation by israel in the late 1980 ’s . having fled the scene , palestinian leaders born under occupation and spent time in israeli prisons will most likely fill this vacuum .
the regime is likely to attempt to counter this eruption of nationalism , while also maintaining its powerful statist rhetoric . these are the key ingredients in the nationalistic stew that may seem to appeal to russia for now . but , to defeat the far right , putin ’s regime will be forced to assume its own stand on more or less liberal ideological grounds . judging by putin ’s ’s most politicized address to parliament , his regime is acutely aware of the danger posed by populist nationalist nationalist nationalist party . it will not be easy for a regime based on the twin pillars of the bureaucracy and the security apparatus .
today , coal and natural gas provide more than two-thirds of the country ’s electricity needs , with renewables accounting for up to 5 % . this new load would easily have replaced the electrical generated by the country ’s six nuclear reactors . in taiwan , tsai is equally committed . during the first election last year , in response to public opposition from nuclear energy following japan ’s 2011 fukushima meltdown , tsai vowed to make taiwan nuclear-free by 2025 . indeed , tsai has called for the share of renewables to rise to nearly 20 % over the next eight years , with capacity coming mainly from solar and offshore wind .
rudolf diesel ’s first engine , engineered in the late 1800s , ran on fuel derived from peanut oil . rudolf diesel ’s original appeal in recent decades alone , owing to efforts to secure affordable energy , generate incomes , and alleviate those dependency on which ford warned . as production of those fuels grows , we will need policies , programs , and capacities to ensure that it is used sustainably , free up food markets , or compromising food security , which will always be a first priority . the pioneers of biofuels would likely be surprised by how little it contributes to the total fuel supply today . as the production of those fuels grows , we will need policies , programs , and capabilities to ensure that it is used sustainably , without distorting food markets , or by stopping food security , which will always be the first priority .
others fanned the flames of anglo-german antagonism , a caricaturing protectionist germany as the barbarian society survivors on horse sausages , and dog-meat ; lloyd george , a future prime minister , told audiences that he was more fearful of a german sausage than he was of the german navy . one reason the free trade defeated protectionism in britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people who felt emotions and identity , rather than just their rational interest in more wealth and cheap food . in towns , displays in shop windows portrayed the costs of tariffs on ordinary consumers . liberals and the radicals organized traveling display , color posters , and political amusement . one reason the free trade defeated protectionism in britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people ’s emotions and identity , not just their rational interest in more wealth and cheap food .
the inordinately lax regulatory environment has proven lethal , encouraging northern european banks to pad their balance sheets with south european governments and banking bonds . when the greek bubble burst , it left in its shades expensive economies that had lost competitiveness . europe should now take advantage of calm across the storms fronts to rethink europe ’s currency union from the ground up . efforts to create the european equivalent of the dollar and impose a fiscal union on it at the top , despite the absence of a common european state , are bound to fail . it will transform member countries into debtors and lenders to one another , stoking even more animosity .
indeed , the latter now stand at well over 15 % of gdp . hits chinese exports are likely to take as a result of the region ’s currency depreciations , nevertheless , probably unlikely to be instantly felt . moreover , inflation in some asean countries may rise again with the advent of floating exchange rates . rival asian economies will need to be stabilized before they can import more aggressively . owing to this , its price competitiveness may ruin .
following from above , it has both operational and symbolic relevance . operationally , it is constrained by isr , and does not involve ground troops . operationally , it is limited to isr , and does not involve ground forces . moreover , there are real disagreements within america ’s borders when it comes to assessing the threat that al qaeda in mali poses to american interests . for europe , that situation is worrying at two counts .
by contrast , when a country ’s foreign assets are held not by households , but by institutions like pension funds , they can be identified and taxed . the private sector had large foreign assets , while the government held roughly equal amounts of foreign liabilities . even so , argentina went bankrupt , because wealthy argentines spirited their assets out of the country , and thus out of their reach for the us government , while poor argentines refused to pay the taxes needed to satisfy foreign creditors ’ ’ claims . this analysis suggests that the “ excessive [ current-account ] imbalances ” are to be introduced as part of the ongoing reform of eurozone governance goes in the right direction . by and large , that is as much the case as it is in europe .
but the exposure of foreign tv stations also means that many disillusioned algerians are seeking to flee to italy , france , or germany as their only hope for jobs and a decent life . will the coming months bring genuine change in algeria ? will social and economic reforms be implemented to secure the equitable distribution of the country ’s oil and gas riches ? disappointed by their political leaders of algerians , real madrid , chile , and milan are the household name . startups of barcelona , genuine madrid , chile , and milan are the household name .
it remains far from clear what led greenspan to support the tax cut . the most likely explanation lies in the combination of the two , for he and bush pursued the same “ starvation ” political strategy that calls for tax cuts to work down revenue , thereby forcing the public sector to downsize . in short , like greenspan ’s departs , he leaves behind an american economy burdened by high household and government debt , and its fragile balance sheets , a legacy that is already contributing to global financial instability . the lower interest rates worked , but not so because they boosted investment , but because they led households to refinance their mortgages and fueled a house price bubble . was this massive economic misjudgment or the currying favor with the bush administration ?
ethiopia is hardly the only recent example of how conflicts over land-rights can set the stage for political and humanitarian crises . a historic drought may have created the conditions for syria ’s civil war . and food insecurity stemming from the mismanagement of land markets is an important factor driving migrants to europe . land-related issues will continue to undermine global stability , particularly if the effects of climate change worsen existing problems . a historic drought may have created the conditions for syria ’s civil war .
because they lead far more carbon-intensive lifestyles than everyone else , they would contribute far more per capita to a carbon dividend . in short , a carbon dividend would distribute money from the predominantly wealthy high polluters to the predominantly low – and a middle-income low of polluters , all while lowering co2 emissions . more to the point , they would pay in far more than it returns , whereas the poorest 60 % of americans would recover more than they put in . on their own , this would represent a smart step in the right direction , one that would not invite a “ yellow vest ” reaction . but do n’t let one tell you that ’s ’s up a silver bullet .
a further lesson for sarkozy from germany is that an enlightened corporate state needs the support of political leadership , just as accommodating trade unions are . german chancellor angela merkel makes no secret corporate speeches attacking a strong european and european central bank on the mandate of price stability . on the contrary , she is advocates of an independent ecb , and has let germany ’s trade unions and firms know that they will have to live with a hard currency and anti-inflationary monetary policy . rather , she simply understands that for an economy in need of becoming competitive , bad-mouthing europe and the ecb are sending the wrong signals . this is not to say that merkel is free-market capitalist ; there is little evidence of this .
owing to its geopolitical weight , germany ’s perspective is now synonymous with that of the european union . and the eu ’s outlook is not that of the hegemon ; rather , it concern the rule of law , integration , and the peaceful reconciliation of member states ’ interests . owing to its geopolitical weight , germany ’s perspective is now synonymous with that of the european union . and the eu ’s outlook is not that of a hegemon ; rather , it concerns the rule of law , integration , and the peaceful reconciliation of member states ’ interests . germany is in the same boat as all other europeans with respect to its own security .
but critics have found it hard to demonstrate memory or other cognitive problem that has endure beyond three months or so . in fact , very few of those who get the ect will also not get benzodiazepines to it , causing significant autobiographical memory problems when it alone and antipsychotic drugs that create difficulties in terms of lists or telephone numbers and other comparable difficulties . nor can the enduring autobiographical memory disturbances and inability to remember lists are readily ascribed to ect , just as ect can rarely be turned on its own . there is no longer any dispute that ect can make short shrift ; nor can there be any longer any dispute that ect can do the job . likewise , about the case of antidepressants do not seem to be the same .
but no government has found cacs reasonable for resolving domestic restructuring . if a cac required , say , 75 % of holders of every bond class , the vultures could buy 26 % of only one bond class and block the entire restructuring problem . if they were , there would be no domestic bankruptcy law that spells out issues like precedence and equitable treatment . above all , cacs also suffer a problem with “ aggregation ” problem . so why should we think they would suffice in a much more complex world of sovereign-debt restructurings ?
holding talks in a current atmosphere of mistrust , mutual recrimination , and fearmongering will require substantial investment in political capital on a sustainable basis . the eu should bolster the case for open dialogue and hard bargaining , precisely what has long lacked in western policy on ukraine ’s crisis , and toward ukraine ’s euro-atlantic region . moving beyond the current adversarial approach to finding common ground will take time . a quick deal will not be feasible . we arrived at this point precisely because both russia and the west spent more than a decade seeking unilateral advantage and eschewing negotiated compromises .
but it also represents the global gold standard in many fields , including technology , defense and research and development . contrary to china ’s statist legacy , america ’s historical experience has instilled in its citizens and leaders a devotion to liberty , including free markets and local autonomy . america ’s federal government expanded once again during and after wwii , reflecting the country of new global hegemony and that of its urban middle class ( created in no small part through new deal backing for unionization and home ownership ) . america ’s federal government ’s size and power grew only slowly until the 1930s , when a new one , comprising federal programs , public works projects , and financial reform and regulation , was enacted in response to the great depression . with american foreign policy having expanded again during and after wwii , the us government assumed a larger role in areas ranging from defense and foreign policy to health care and social security .
isis has so far hit france and turkey the hardest . isis has reportedly trained 400-600 fighters for “ outside operations ” ” involving urban guerilla warfare , improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) , surveillance , countersecurity , and forgery . the precise number of european fighters who have received training from isis and back home remains unknown . france has allegedly trained 400-600 fighters for “ outside operations ” involving urban guerilla warfare , improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) , surveillance , countersecurity , and fortification . the exact number of european fighters who have received training from isis and the return home remains unknown .
in bangladesh , for example , schools run by the brac employ female teachers ( key to increasing girls ’ enrollment ) , and outperform government-run schools in terms of learning outcomes . but a shortage of qualified female teachers makes scaling up such efforts extremely difficult to avoid . to account for the learning crisis in many developing countries , governments and development agencies should look to more opportunities to form strategic partnerships with non-state providers . fortunately , the afghan government has started opening its doors to innovative ngo models like brac ’s community-based education programs . women account for just one-third of all afghan primary-school teachers and secondary-school enrollment , owing partly to extraordinarily low female literacy .
in all four of these countries , the severity of economic mismanagement reflects the long-standing application of state funds to finance the regime ’s allies and clients , rather than to benefit the entire population . these regimes dominated every country ’s private sector through cronyism , not only to extract and distribute rents to their clients , but also to block the emergence of autonomous entities that might finance an opposition movement . as a result , capital and skills were misallocated , the business climate deteriorated and competition , innovation , and growth suffered . and protesters , driven by economic grievances , were reinvigorated by the upgrading within broader security terms , owing to the islamic state ’s defeat and wind-down of syria ’s war . together , these economic shocks have exposed each country ’s sectarian-based political system .
this raises the old question of whether a currency union can work without a fiscal union or at least as stronger and more binding fiscal rules ( maastricht ’s deficit liabilities are too easily violated ) . but the decreased flexibility in response to economic shocks will surely test it . at present , europe ’s governments tend to emphasize the disparate , even discordant , fiscal reactions now being embraced by european governments . to that we have to add coordinated financial regulation and bailout policies , because the deposits flow quickly across borders in response to national collateral and european insurance . will the euro ’s second decade turn out to be as successful as the first ?
but imagine a world in which textbooks adapt to many learning styles and translated into myriad languages . nowadays , pluto remains on the planets ’ list in science textbooks and who knows how long it will take to remove it . nowadays , pluto remains on the list of planets in science textbooks and who knows how long it will take to abolish it . but imagine a world where textbooks are continually updated and corrected by the legion of contributors . such a world was only a dream perther .
one powerful school of thought that emerged almost as soon as the killing began in 1989 is that the more radical student-educated youth leaders were reckless . by provoking the regime , students derailed any chance of slow political reform that their more moderate elders had carefully set themselves up in train . indeed , so the proponents of such a school often added , china was not yet ready for democracy . it was supposed to be clear to them that a violent crackdown was inevitable . if only they could , in china , take their place .
delivery challenges abound in war zones , but not everywhere . it is too late , now for the non-military instruments of coercion to have a much effect , though the security council ’s threat of an international criminal tribunal for atrocity crimes , including any use of chemical weapons , must remain on the table . but what kind of military/response options still vigorously favored by many policymakers and pundits ? delivery issues abound in war zones , but not everywhere . delivery issues abound in war zones , but not everywhere .
trump ’s global trade war , for example , is equally self-defeating . by slapping tariffs on america ’s closest allies , he is effectively driving them into china ’s arms . yet by reneging on the nuclear deal with iran , trump has made war in the region all the more likely . by slapping tariffs on america ’s closest allies , he is driving them practically into china ’s arms . and , by getting off track to assuage north korea ’s drift of international isolation while extracting almost nothing in return , trump has consolidated china ’s standing in east asia .
each country could create a council that represents public entities ( transportation , public works , customs ) , and major users ( exporters and logistics companies ) that must work together to identify ways to reduce the logistics costs . communications between users and government services are vitally important to reach any true improvement . it is just as vital , albeit to the extent that committees will be developed along similar lines in each country ’s provincial domains . regions then can be turned to growth engines . merchandise need not run through capital , as it does in most latin american and caribbean countries , with associated cost increases .
but policies that might work in a perfect world of efficient , resilient financial markets could be dangerous if applied in highly imperfect real-world markets . as we saw ten years ago , when financial institutions operating in an environment of insecurity can become fragile and collapse , imposing high costs on society . back then , the idea of a temporary european exit from the euro is especially ill-advised . and they are consistent with the positions taken by germany ’s finance ministry under its previous governments . the fdp ’s thinking has broad support in germany and among german economists ( and shares many other european economists ) .
will this return to robust growth , or will the us have an anemic recovery , à la japan in the 1990 ’s ? right now , i cast this vote for the latter , particularly because the enormous debt legacy is likely to dampen enthusiasm for the large stimulus that is required . many wall street financiers have received their cash gobs going up , going back to their fiscal religion of low deficits . without a sufficiently large stimulus ( in excess of 2 % of gdp ) , we will experience a vicious negative spiral : a weak economy will mean extra bankruptcies , which will push stock prices and interest rates up , undermine consumer confidence and weaken the banks . high and growing consumption and investment will be cutting back further .
lowering trade barriers even more could double average incomes in the poorest parts of the world over the next 15 years . it has already helped lift more than one billion people out of poverty in the last quarter-century . yet , in rich countries today , sentiment has taken a turn against free trade . prague – global free trade provides the biggest opportunity to improve human welfare over the next decade and a half . yes , there are costs to freer trade , which must be addressed better ; but the cost is vastly outpacing the benefits .
when muslims form a minority , they tended to associate themselves peacefully with other religions , but where their populations are substantial ( as in nigeria ) , they have tended to assert themselves . nevertheless , nigeria ( and perhaps zanzibar ) remains the exception in islamic assertiveness in sub-saharan africa , raising the notion that an active “ islamic world ” includes only a relatively restricted segments of sub-saharan african muslims . whether they like it or not , majority of sub-saharan african muslims are represented by states that are mostly secular , christian , or dominated by other religions . whether they like it or not , the majority of sub-saharan african muslims are represented by states that are mostly secular , christian , or dominated by other religions . whether they like it or not , the majority of sub-saharan african muslims are represented by states that are mostly secular , christian , or dominated by other religions .
“ we forget that for many centuries , growth has been essentially zero , ” ” ” ” he writes . indeed , piketty argues that our own “ obsession with growth ” merely serves as a pretext for doing nothing about health , education , or redistribution . piketty sees this as one of the grounds that growth was essentially zero . and it is an obsession rooted in very much in the current pattern . “ one percent of real growth means doubling your economy ’s size every 30 or 35 years .
new york – as the european commission warned earlier this year ( under its previous leadership ) , china is “ “ an economic competitor ” in the pursuit of technological leadership and a systemic rival promotion of alternative governance models . for good reason , many europeans are so sensitive to human-rights issues in hong kong , xinjiang , and elsewhere . for good reason , many europeans are sensitive to human-rights issues in hong kong , xinjiang , and elsewhere . europeans , too , are rightly worried about an economic issue . this language represents a sharp departure from that of previous official eu communiqués .
a final question to consider when assessing america ’s presidential candidates is whom each would appoint as the next chair of the american federal reserve . the center-left leftists – biden , amy klobuchar , pete buttigieg , might reappoint powell , who did good jobs or elect a moderate democratic economist like former fed vice chair alan blinder or former us treasury secretary larry summers . trump , who has repeatedly criticized current fed chair jerome powell for pursuing too little monetary-policy easing , would most likely select dovish candidate . a left-leaning democrat might do the same , given the left ’s fascination with risky ideas that advocate a massive pile of fed-funded debt . though the democrats have frequently criticized trump ’s approach , they are not proposing further rounds of trade liberalization .
other recent “ terror ” ” – related reporting has been just as flimsy . boston globe , for example , was running an article about a man identified only by his first name , canny , whom the brothers carjacked three days after the attack . danny has argued that the only word on the brothers ’ conversation that he understood is manhattan , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and that the terrorists had asked him whether his car might leave the state , say , to get to new york city . the globe ’s one-source reporting proved nothing – and was unverifiable by other late reporters or businesspeople , but it suggested a great deal , resulting in a spate of equally unverifiable reports that new york has been targeted . the boston globe , for example , ran an article of what used to be a man – identified only by his first name , cannmo , whom the brothers carjacked three days after the attack .
a second study , funded by ifad and recently released by the international food policy research institute , examines the worldwide economic contraction , starting in 2012 , in the face of rural populations . so far , these gains have not been equitably distributed , and sub-saharan africa has seen far less progress than other areas . all at the same time , these gains are not evenly distributed , and sub-saharan africa has seen far fewer progress than other regions . what stands out is that the downturn , with 38 million more people remaining mired in extreme poverty in 2030 than likely otherwise , with farm households in middle-income countries particularly at risk . this poses a serious challenge to the sdgs to end poverty – in all of its forms everywhere , ” ” ” ” ” and strengthens the case for policies and investment specifically targeting rural areas that are where poverty-reduction measures are needed more and will have a bigger impact .
such policies might then be entirely subjugated to the demands of the gold standard and free of capital mobility . but , once the political franchise had been enlarged , the working class had organized itself , and mass politics became the norm , domestic economic goals began competing for ( and overwhelm ) outside regulations and constraints . the attempt to re-constitute the pre-world war i model of globalization collapsed in 1931 , when domestic politics drove the british government to choose homegrown reflation over the gold standard . the architects of the bretton woods regime kept this lesson in mind as they redesigned the world ’s monetary system in 1944 . a classic case is britain ’s short-lived return to the gold standard .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . washington , dc , more than 60 % of all employed women in sub-saharan africa work for agriculture . yet the region ’s women farmers often reap meager harvests , not because of inclement weather or poor soils , but because of their gender , or , more precisely , the result of a dense web of laws , policies , programs , and customs that place them at a significant disadvantage . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenge to us interests elsewhere in the world .
as the german government and some corporate leaders , including ceo of daimler-benz , have already recognized , an washington-based approach to refugee absorption and integration can help to ease some of europe ’s protracted structural problems . and , already , labor-market flexibility has been undermined by structural inertia , including the difficulty of retooling and reretraining workers , particularly the long term unemployed . beyond the need to ease the human misery that will fill the tv screens and front pages of newspapers lies the imperative not to miss the significant medium-term opportunities that migration provides . after all , a significant share of the incoming refugee population is said to be educated , motivated , and committed to building a better future in their new homes . though there are pockets of high unemployment in europe today , the ratio of workers to the elderly will decline considerably in the longer term .
with digital-commerce having estimated to benefit at least 80 million young africans by 2030 , opportunities for gig workers will grow . and when access to a wide range of valued benefits , from health insurance to pensions , is made conditional on registering their business and paying taxes , there will be a powerful reason for them to formalize their work . digitization could allow the formal sector to offer a spectrum of benefits for workers and responsibilities to employers . for example , if an independent worker drives one hour to work for a uber , walks a dog for another hour on the rover , each platform would contribute an equal amount , along with its or her benefits . digitization could enable the formal sector to offer circles of benefits to workers and responsibilities to employers .
implementing ( and financing ) such initiatives will require sustained political will . british policymakers also need to move beyond the ad hoc response to natural and man-made disaster by building more effective and reliable safety systems . for example , they could facilitate the provision of affordable insurance to support farmers , or develop some types of mutual-assistance scheme . british policymakers also need to move beyond the ad hoc responses to natural and man-made disaster by building more effective and reliable protection systems . for starters , they need to take action to protect the rural environment , ensuring animal welfare and improving education , knowledge transfer , and business training for farmers and agricultural workers .
frankfurt – the european central bank is at the center of the big , risky experiment . crisis management has been transformed through major market distortions , with certain segments of their performance no longer explainer through fundamental economic data . by contrast , financial markets are flooded through liquidity , if not by all of them . the unintended consequences of this policy have become increasingly visible , and will become increasingly tangible with the american federal reserve ’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy . meanwhile , financial markets are flooded with liquidity .
we ’ve seen hints of a new paradigm in apple ’s iphone , which is allowing gestural finger motions ; but , in the intelligence community , concept visualization can be so radical that most ordinary users may have barely recognized what it was . designs are inspired by cognitive science , arts , even science fiction . we ’ve seen hints of a new paradigm in apple ’s iphone , which enables gestural finger motions , but in the intelligence community , concepts of visualization can be so radical that most ordinary users may have barely recognized what it was . at a time when improvements in computational interface computation , form is the key . it is easy to forget that years ago , telephones had neither buttons nor primordial – indeed , you had to pick up the tab and ask the operator to make that connection .
but epimetheus was charmed by pandora , and heedlessly welcomed her into her life . it was only later that he came to realize his terrifying error – that of course . as plato tells us , prometheus ’ name implies “ foresight , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” because he always looked forward , unlike his carefree brother , epimetheus , whose name implies “ hindsight ” ” ” ” ” . but that , too , is not the whole story . as the more rational and justifiably paranoid paranoid of the two , prometheus tried to warn its big brother not to embrace zeus ’s dangerous gift .
crux of the problem is that a draft constitution would give the eu a new , much easier method for occupying majorities in the council of ministers . indeed , downplaying the gravity of the latest crisis is easy : one can argue that the immediate cause of a breakdown , when examined closely , is not all that severe . under the method adopted three years ago at the eu ’s nice summit , every member country has a certain number of votes , weighted on population , but small countries are protected by having proportionally more votes than the big countries . this system is what is known as qualified majority voting . the chances that they will do so will do so again .
rome – prices for many staple foods rose dramatically during the fall of 2007-2008 , compounding the food crisis for many poor and developing countries alike . several factors contributed to the crisis , including high oil prices , soaring demand for bio-fuel crops , falling global stockpiles of food commodities , and lower cereal output . strong economic growth and expansionary monetary policies further bolstered the trend , as did protectionist measures such as export restrictions . international prices of maize , rice , and wheat reached their highest levels in the next 30 years , causing political and economic instability – and leading to food riots in many countries . while these factors undoubtedly place upward pressure on food prices , they themselves can not explain steep interest-rate hikes .
the similarities with the islamic state ’s views are glaring . erdoğan ’s ambition to restore turkey ’s primacy within the sunni world is driving him to collude with that challenge to the western-devised regional order . indeed , turkey has offered logistical support to the islamic state , even as it has enabled the group of ’s murderous members to massacre thousands of civilian kurds and yazidis in the syrian town of kobani on turkey ’s own doorstep . this highlights another matter on which turkey and the islamic state converge : the kurds . in a video produced following the battle for the mosul dam in august , the group called for the “ end of the sykes-picot process , ” ” ” ” and proclaimed the need to redraw the nile ’s occupations .
but perhaps no current us leader is more susceptible to miskowtost to science and half-baked conspiracy theories than america ’s president and wannabe authoritarian , donald trump . it should never be forgotten that trump wavered his way into us policy by promoting the racist “ birther ” argument , which argued that then-president barack obama was n’t born in the us , and therefore did not qualify for a house he held . only since entering the white house did the lunacy has any increase . so far , he has stands out outright for claiming outright that those markets are acting at behehest of “ world jewry ” ( his architects , many turkish islamists , believing , out of the 1908 young turkish revolution , and the secular republic that arose after world war i ) . but his core supporters hear the dog whistle behind his leaked science and half-baked conspiracy theories than america ’s president and wannabe authoritarian , donald trump .
in order to ensure full transparency for the tender process and eliminate the problems that have been experienced in the past , western advisers are aiding the us government . in the energy sector , we are also doing everything possible to make ukraine attractive to foreign investors . in order to ensure the full transparency of the tender process , and to eliminate the problems that have been seen in the past , western advisers are aiding the us . in order to manage this supply of the world ’s huge western energy firms , we are also doing everything possible to make ukraine an attractive member of foreign investors . in the energy industry , we are replacing the state-owned distributors of energy .
japan , korea , and singapore , to be sure , had similar political models in the past ( though they later adjusted them in line with their gdp growth ) . now , however , these countries are once again espousing forms of state capitalism and a return to industrial policy ( encouraged , like the 2008 global financial meltdown , which exposed a new rationale for the return to government intervention ) . in japan , the postal services that were privatized are supposed to be re-nationalized and the role of government finance is being strengthened . in the case of japan , the postal services that had been privatized are supposed to be re-nationalized , and the role of government finance is being enhanced . in the past , japan , korea , and singapore held similar political models ( though they later adjusted them in line with their gdp growth ) .
since the 2008 financial crisis , the world has become accustomed to such linkages and spillovers . but at least europe has benefited from falling commodity prices . without the ecb ’s commitment , in place since 2012 to prevent sovereign-debt yields from soaring , there would be lingering risks facing the eurozone , and , indeed , the entire edifice of the european union is of sovereign-debt defaults . since the 2008 financial crisis , the world has become accustomed to such linkages and spillovers . capital flight would materially add to their plight , in some cases disastrously .
seventy-nine percent of gaza ’s households live in poverty ; eight out of ten depend on food aid . almost half of the labor force is unemployed ; local industry has collapsed . almost half of the labor force is unemployed ; local industry has collapsed . and let the world take note of that conditions are worse today than at any time since the occupation began . seventy-nine percent of gaza ’s households live in extreme poverty ; eight out of ten depend on food aid .
new york – europe needs , if anything , to accept responsibility for the lack of a common asylum policy that has transformed this year ’s rising tide of refugees from a manageable problem into yet another political crisis . that precipitated panic among asylum-seekers , the general public , and authorities responsible for the rule of law and order . the eu needs a comprehensive plan for responding to the crisis , one that reasserts effective governance over asylum-seekers ’ flows so that they take place in a safe , orderly way , and at a pace reflecting europe ’s capacity to absorb them . each member state has selfishly focused on its own interests , often acting against the interests of others . the asylum seekers have been the primary victims , and they have been the main victims .
but they would argue that his strengthened position now allows him to substitute for a credit-fueled growth model with something more sustainable . this is where technologists come in , by offering new ways to correct or avoid potential errors . economists would concede that xi ’s campaign conveniently has removed many of his potential rivals , too . moreover , despite xi ’s successful success in consolidating his hold on power and extending his hold on it indefinitely , there is every reason to doubt that he is willing to risk a new economic model if sustainability proves incompatible with maintaining rapid growth . of course , whether they are right remains to be seen .
the american economist martin feldstein wrote in 1997 that the monetary union would create conflict within europe . at that time , he was derided and deemed an entrenched opponent of the european project . alas , his insight was sound : european countries today are at loggerheads not with their common currency , but precisely because of it . the american economist martin feldstein wrote in 1997 that monetary union would create conflict within europe . unfortunately , his insight was sound : european countries nowadays at loggermany , despite its common currency , but precisely because of it .
still , more moments have come lately , favoring huxley ’s vision of political order over that of orwell . whereas a major distinction in nineteen eighty-four is between rulers and ruled , in the brave new world , people are divided on a variety of social orders defined by disparate tastes and lifestyles . of course , no single novel provides a consummate lens through which to view any society . the same could be said of china today , where the gaps between rich and poor , urban and rural populations , and coastal and inland culture are so great that it is far more difficult than before people of a varied walks of life to feel that they share both common plights and goals . sometimes , like when violence was recently used to quell south chinese peasants protesting official land grabs , the ccp still shows itself a willingness to exploit “ boot-on-the-face ” suppression .
yet the lesson of recent studies is that beliefs about what a government can and should do are not immutable . they are susceptible to persuasion , experience , and change circumstances . yet the lesson of recent studies is that beliefs about what a government can and should do are not immutable . they seem susceptible to persuasion , experience , and change circumstances . they are susceptible to persuasion , experience , and change of circumstances .
copenhagen – in one of his first public-opinion statements as america ’s president-elect , barack obama has focused attention on the causes of climate change , and has made clear both his priorities and the facts on which those priorities will rest . obama ’s policy outline has been presented through video to california governor arnold schwarzenegger of the governors of the global warming summit and has again shown in poznan , poland , to leaders assembled to flesh out the global warming roadmap . according to obama , “ few challenges facing america and the world are more urgent than the fight against climate change . ” according to obama , “ few challenges facing america and the world are more urgent than the fight against climate change . ” such statements are now being commonplace for most political leaders around the world , although it neglects tackling the question of how much the us can do to help america and the world through climate policies versus other policies .
its “ civilizing ” mission created a sense of collective purpose as much as a narrative of uninterrupted democratic and economic progress . thus , while a sort of “ outer empire ” enabled , first in north america and the caribbean , then in india and southeast asia , the english had erected the land empire , by expanding from the south to the north . but the fusion of identities was always incomplete , not least in iran , where the fallout from independence still reverberates a century later through the insecurity generated by northern ireland ’s “ backstop . ” before the formation of an overseas empire , first in north america and the caribbean , then in india and southeast asia – the english had built the land empire , by expanding from the south of the british saber-rattling to the northwestern . still , for centuries the british empire generated wealth , supplied raw materials and created a globe-spanning professional opportunities for all british isles .
moreover , a concerted anti-corruption campaign could serve as unifying forces in countries with deep political divisions . freedom of speech , and other fundamental human rights , are not elitist luxuries , as authoritarians proclaim . while a majoritarian government can ride roughshod over minorities ’ interests , corrupt regimes steal themselves from everybody . because they are indispensable to the isolation of free societies , they are indispensable . this is why , over the last year , corruption has sparked mass protests from bucharest to brasilia .
in other words , trumpism might be the solution to the liberalism crisis , not the portent of its disintegration . disengaging peacefully from exposed global responsibilities will be trump ’s greatest challenge . trump ’s geopolitical and economic views should be judged against this background of disenchantment , rather than by an ideal moral or economic norm . the promise that he must work with russia to end the savage conflict in syria is reasonable , though it implies the victory of bashar al-assad ’s regime . viewed in this way , trump ’s isolationism is a populist way of saying that america needs to renege on its commitments , which it has neither a land nor a willingness to honor .
madrid – back in 1996 , binyamin netanyahu won the general election by mobilizing large constituencies against then-prime minister shimon peres ’s alleged intention to “ divide jerusalem . ” as us secretary of state john kerry prepares to submit to a framework agreement for an conclusive round of israeli-palestinian peace negotiations , netanyahu ’s hardline position on jerusalem is simply a non-starter . almost two decades later , netanyahu remains committed to old , vacuous slogans about a “ united jerusalem ” – a conviction that could , yet again , unravel the israel-palestine peace process . in a last-ditch effort to improve his proposal ’s chances of success , us president barack obama , who has mostly shunned a proactive role in the peace process during his second term , met with netanyahu at the white house to urge him to moderate his current stature . but changing netanyahu ’s mind will not be easy – not least because of the domestic political pressure he faces .
new haven – the closing day of the summer marked the start of yet another season of futile policymaking by the likes of the world ’s major central banks , the american federal reserve , and the bank of japan . both the fed and the boj are pursuing strategies that are woefully disconnected from the economies that they have been previously entrusted to govern . and the alchemists of the boj have unveiled yet another feeble unconventional policy gambit . the fed has done nothing that is , precisely , the problem . moreover , their latest actions are fueling a deepening commitment to an increasingly insidious transmission mechanism between monetary policy , financial markets , and asset-dependent economies .
today , in a strategic environment marked by terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , russia is very much a part of the solution . it was henry kissinger , who argued in the wake of the terrorist attacks of new york and washington of 2001 , that the tragedy could turn out to be transformed into an opportunity . today , in a strategic environment marked by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , russia is very much a part of the solution . it was henry kissinger , who argued in the wake of the terrorist attacks of new york and washington of 2001 , that the tragedy could turn out to be transformed into an opportunity . much has been accomplished over the last six months to transform rome ’s political message into a practical collaboration .
to the outside world , suleimani was the mastermind of the regime ’s terrorist activities outside iran , as well as a puppet master of its proxies across the region , not least hezbollah in lebanon . yet it was the iranians who , in fact , was a more complicated figure . and , as one of the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) , not tainted by allegations of corruption , he was mooted as a likely presidential candidate in the upcoming election . though regime hardliners viewed him as a hero , many iranians who had lost loved ones in peaceful demonstrations , or who objects to the regime ’s targeted attacks on iranian dissidents in the diaspora saw him to be quite another . over the last few years , however , the regime has pushed a clever public-relations campaign to depict suleimani like napoleon – or the caesar-like warrior-poet .
he plans to cut the corporate-tax rate from 33 % to at least 25 % , and to exclude financial investment from wealth taxation . yet he also wants to prop up the economy with a € 50 billion ( $ 55 billion ) stimulus package , extending the welfare state . to square the circle , macron needs growth and relies on supply-side reforms to deliver it . he plans to cut the corporate-tax rate from 33 % to at least 25 % , and to exclude financial investment from the taxation of wealth . a vocal critic of protectionism , he will push the eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement , and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the united states .
prague : many americans seem enamored of the feeling that because the soviet empire had collapsed , the dangers of war may cross the list of potential risks . america , they argue , should heed its own problems , and should not get involved in a world where its attempts to do good are rewarded with ingratitude . isolationism has a long tradition in america ; it returns in fits and differing forms . in the end , america is paying thousands of times as much for its initial lack of interest than it might pay has it become engaged in the early stages of the crisis , or , better yet , even earlier . never in modern times , however , has a level of isolationism kept america out of dangers ; instead , it delays engagement when conflagrations are ablaze .
traffic-clogged cities need improved public transportation , and financing the spread of bus rapid transit ( brt ) systems is a proven route to reducing congestion , down emissions , and commuting costs . there are a number of other areas where those committed to combating climate change can follow our example . traffic-clogged cities need better public transportation , and financing the expansion of bus rapid transit ( brt ) systems is a proven route to reducing congestion , outspent emissions , and commuting costs . here , too , creative solutions can be found , first and foremost . using the asset-backed security model , the us recently joined together with the un green climate fund and china to design a $ 450 million “ green bond ” facility .
such an alliance would also enable a new foreign policy for europe , one promoting peace and sustainable development underpinned by new un-american security arrangements . europe , a magnet for hundreds of millions of would-be economic migrants , could , and i believe would regain control over its borders , allowing it to strengthen and enforce needed limits on migration . again , the eurobonds , a green partnership with china , and a intra-european unity could make all the difference . the geopolitical terms of a new grand coalition government would seem clear . the spd should hold out for ministerial leadership on economic and financial policy , with the cdu/csu holding the chancellorship .
that is why it is time for japan ’s leaders to shift their focus from a demand-focused first and second arrows to a supply-targeting third arrow : a new growth strategy . in any case , the success of monetary policy is hard to deny . as the deflation gap narrows , however , the overall effects of monetary policy on monetary policy will weaken , because it increasingly influences prices more than output . in any case , the success of monetary policy alone is hard to deny . fortunately , that is precisely what abe intends to do .
race has always been a provocative topic when the needs of science and statistics intersect with politics . the first is the republican principle , enshrined in the us constitution , that recognizes only citizens and accepts no distinction between them on the grounds of origin , race , or religion . according to a law that dates back to the french revolution , and reconfirmed in 1978 , french government officials are forbidden to collect information on a citizen with ethnic or racial origins , whether real or supposedly when implementing a census or other efforts to gather a population ’s statistical information . there are two major reasons for this to say about this . the first is the republican principle , enshrined in the us constitution , that recognizes only citizens and accepts any distinction between them because of origin , race , or religion .
eliminating corruption will be possible only with an effective combination of smart-prevention strategies and robust law enforcement , compounded by a belief that greed can not be untaught , accountability can be taught , and impunity can wither be ended . knowledge-sharing across countries could illuminate the most effective strategies for achieving this goal . in both politics and business , integrity and accountability must be the rule , not the exception . knowledge-sharing across countries could illuminate the most effective strategies for achieving this goal . for example , no one prefers to live in a society where bribes must be paid in order to ensure basic public services like health care and education .
but the goal is surely worth embracing , for the evidence is overwhelming : impunity is not only morally noxious ; it is also economically costly and deeply corrosive of wellbeing . recent studies have shown that when the “ generalized trust ” in society is high , economic performance improves , and life satisfaction becomes higher . trade agreements , among other reasons , are more easy to reach and efficiently carried out . compelling america , russians , nigerian , or chinese citizens that corruption really can go to check might seem like a futile task . commercial agreements , among other things , are more easy to reach and efficiently .
the three musteers remain positive about some elements of the post-crisis scheme . the fed started the process of normalization of monetary policy , but has not completed the job , and president donald trump is doing what he can to prevent them from running out of step , by heckling from the sidelines . bank capital has been greatly strengthened , and derivatives markets have been materially enhanced . there is an urgent need for “ restock the emergency arsenal , ” ” ” ” ” ” particularly when there is relatively little scope to relax monetary policy . as they put it , “ using fiscal adrenalin could be reduced just when most needs are needed .
as a case in point , many western observers thought that norway ’s trade relationship with china would be undermined when the dissident liu xiaobo was invited to receive the nobel peace prize in oslo in december 2010 . the same month , however , one of china ’s largest oil firms concluded a drilling contract with norway ’s status-quo oil , clearly signaling that diplomatic tensions would not stop business . china has complained loudly , refused to allow liu to collect the nobel prize ; and even threatened norway with the financial blows . so western diplomats who negotiate with china should call the lower-level officials ’ bluff , and focus on putin ’s signal-to-noise ratio , bearing in mind that , ultimately , decisions are taken quietly at higher levels by more pragmatic leaders who are actually susceptible to pressure . human rights need not take a back seat to doing business with china .
the us might hoped-for america to show more leadership in reforming the global financial system by advocating for stronger international regulation , a global reserve system , and better ways to restructure sovereign debt ; in addressing global warming ; in democratizing us international economic institutions ; and in providing aid to poorer countries . with the euro crisis likely to continue unabated , america ’s continuing malaise does not bode well for global growth . americans should hope for all of this , though i am no sanguine about getting a large portion of it and more likely that america will muddle through – here another small program for struggling students and homebuyers , the end of bush ’s tax cuts for millionaires but no wholesale tax reform , no wholesale tax reform , severe cutbacks for defense spending , or major progress on global warming . with the euro crisis likely to continue unabated , america ’s continuing malaise does not bode well for global growth . that means that the focus of the system must shift away from highly speculative and proprietary trading toward lending and job creation , which implies reforms of financial-sector regulation , and of antitrust and corporate-governance laws , combined with appropriate enforcement to ensure that markets do not become rigged casinos .
indeed , iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another member of the un . the ongoing struggle in the muslim world between sunnis and shi’a recalls a struggle between protestants and catholics in seventeenth-century europe . little wonder , of course , that the saudis , jordanians , egyptians , and the gulf states seek to resist iran ’s own hegemonic ambitions in the region . the stakes , however , are far higher than in the seventeenth-century israel , for iran represents a threat that combines a fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons . of course , the issue is utterly outside israel of its control .
the strategic significance of the dramatic golan heights , overlooking the majority of the north israeli region of galilee , is obvious . because syria , bereft of soviet support , is less a threat to israel , jerusalem may be more flexible than in the past , when the golan was a glacis defend israel not only against syria , but against a bloc seemingly stretching all the way to vladivostok . for israel a quid pro quo for its return to the golan is not a piece of paper with the usual platitudes about peace and coexistence . again , the two parties ’ agendas are different : while syria focuses on the symbolic meaning of its return to the golan , israel wants a concrete , entrenched guarantees regarding the security of its northeastern frontier , just as an end to the syrian-supported incursions from lebanon , a country that is practically a syrian protectorate . so , for today ’s interruptions , the context for negotiations exists , as do the political will on both sides .
whereas army units or riot squads ( omon ) stationed in moscow are excessively disgruntled at the recent police and army reforms to participate in a bloody clampdown , special-operations force forces from the provinces staffed by chechen war veterans might cherish the excitement of coaching it to moscow ’s fat cats . but , while some parts of the security apparatus might have supported an initial crackdown , violent repression would have been hard to sustain . in the fall of 1989 , eastern germany ’s soldiers joined their fellow citizens in the protests that brought down the berlin wall . likewise , troops from poorer regions are more thankful for a pay hike that putin ’s united russia party announced with much fanfare , shortly before the recent duma elections . but , during the same year in china , the protestors in beijing have been crushed by troops from inside mongolia , who have no understanding mandarin and has little sympathy for their big-city dwellers .
that is why european leaders have taken up the ambitious steps that they have done so already . at the same time , rather than proceeding now with bank recapitalization and government-bond purchases , they would similarly have led to disaster . that is why european leaders have taken the ambitious steps they have done there , too . rather than continue to proceeding now with bank recapitalization and government-bond purchases , they would similarly have led to disaster . the crisis of 1992 demonstrated that the existing system is inherently unstable .
in november 2009 , after obama visited japan for the first time as us president , he stressed that he is from hawaii to proud to be “ americans ’ first pacific president . ” moreover , the consequences of such a foreign-policy waffling extending extend far beyond the middle east . the us claims , naturally , that it knows all about democracy . but its diplomatic cognitive dissonance , long criticizing the egyptian regime while continuing to supply it with military hardware , can serve only to undermine the bilateral relationship , just as america ’s approach to musharraf ’s regime has vastly eroded us-pakistani ties . moreover , in november 2009 , then-secretary of state hillary clinton published “ america ’s pacific century , ” ” ” ” ” ” indicating a shift in america ’s global strategy .
to give the additional credence to their praises , they should leave no doubt that had war become america ’s only option . but they should also emphasize that war is not the only issue , and certainly not the automatic “ serious consequence ” to follow from the iraq failure . mr. bush ’s international credibility , of course , should emphasize , does not suffer through avoidance of a war but gains any more , via a check on iraq ’s hitherto covert military effort . indeed , alas , germany ’s government , through its behavior in chancellor schroeder ’s re-election campaign last september , has maneuvered itself out of having any authority on the issue . to be sure , some of america ’s allies are better off than others to get these points across an audience across the atlantic .
studies show that there is no way to reduce poverty , improve nutrition , or achieve other key development goals without the empowerment of land , particularly for women . instead of investing in terracing , planting tree , and buying high-quality fertilizers , africa ’s farmers are seeking to maximize short-term gains . this is especially true with female farmers , facing an additional thicket of discriminatory land laws and customs . africa ’s smallholder family farmers , already burdened by soil degradation , climate change , and resource competition fueled by already-surging populations , are confronting an even more daunting bureaucratic hurdle : no paper to prove the land they are calling home is theirs . insecure of their ability to control their farms in the next season , farmers ’ planning horizons are beginning to shrink .
this , i believe , would have been better for germany in a decade under more neo-liberal policies . it is not that ending the european monetary union is up on an agenda ; it is merely that people have started to think about the possible low-probability contingencies in which the end of emu could be placed on an agenda . coupled with all this , we are northern european discontent with central bankers specifically with the ecb and the euro . but this does n’t seem to be what the german electorate wants , and this makes the covering of german politics four years from now the incalculable . i believe that germany would have been better off this decade under more neo-liberal policies .
that vision has great appeal among those who wish to see the less sectarian-based politics in iraq . the results of march 2010 ’s general election gave iraqiyya 91 91 parliamentary seats , two more than second-place finisher , maliki ’s state of the law coalition . to be sure , its organizers are loath to describe it like a sunni party . rather , it describes itself as a national party , which invites people of all orientations to participate . but , across iraq , there are plenty of men – sunni or shia – who do n’t view iraqiyya as a party dedicated to restoring sunni leadership .
in fact , according to the international monetary fund , some one-third of europe ’s ’s ’s banking sector , representing assets worth $ 8.5 trillion , remains weak and can not generate sustainable profits . restoring stability to europe ’s banking system , through the imf ’s own estimate , will require at least one-third of european banks to close or merge . for the deutsche bank , market speculators already seem to expect a merger , such as with commerzbank , another german institution . but many are “ zombie banks , ” ” with their too many branches , too little deposits , and funding costs far surpass those of their more successful peers . all of this creates significant downside risks for the eu economy , and ultimately europe ’s entire political experiment .
monetary tightening can slow growth temporarily ; prevent asset bubbles growth is notoriously difficult ; and the types of structural reforms needed to secure a shift away from debt-fueled growth are hardly ever popular . today ’s febrile political environment certainly will not simplify matters . none of this will be easy for governments , regulators , or central banks . none of this will be easy for governments , regulators , or central banks . monetary tightening can slow growth temporarily ; prevent bubble-prone growth is notoriously difficult ; and the types of structural reform needed to secure a shift away from debt-fueled growth are hardly ever popular .
but the european central bank , notably by the ecb governing council member lorenzo bini smaghi , has elegantly spelled out the case against debt reduction – a case in which it is politically substantial and deeply moral . thus , it might be a good idea that the eu can prepare to prepare a mechanism that spells out how its debt can be trimmed . indeed , the principle of not reneging on public debt is deeply intertwined with the evolving rule of law , representative government , and modern democracy . consider the 1688 revolution , when britain revolved against the spendthrift stuart dynasty , the british government has adopted a new approach to debt . in the run-up to the glorious 1688 revolution , when britain revolved against the spendthrift dynasty , the british government adopted a new approach to debt .
unfortunately , the battle over the fed ’s independence is far from over . in fact , with some conservative republicans objecting to yet another of his appointments , marvin goodfriend of carnegie mellon university , for daring to suggest that the fed might need a new approach to us monetary policy ( negative interest rates ) to confront the next deep recession or a financial crisis . and , though , someday , the fed will almost surely embrace this kind of advice ( i , too , have published on this issue ) , fareed goodfriend of carnegie mellon university , for daring to suggest that the fed might need a new approach to us monetary policy ( negative interest rates ) in order to confront the next deep recession or the financial crisis . trump may simply maintain his powder dry up so long as a true conflict erupts . and , though , someday , the fed will almost surely embrace this advice ( i have simultaneously leaked on this issue ) , fareed friend of the bank of america , hardly survived america ’s senate banking committee .
yet india remains facing a number of challenges : nearly 300 million people living in extreme poverty , the spread of the naxalite insurgency , the dangers of terrorist attacks ala mumbai , and a sprawling urban slums . moreover , how will singh balance the pro-market and pro-poor policies ? how will he manage the burgeoning middle class with the expectations of a better infrastructure , expanded access to health care and education , uninterrupted electricity and water supply , and more efficient transportation facilities ? at the same time , how will singh balance the pro-market and pro-poor policies ? these problems will not be solved overnight by these problems .
empirically , few firms acquire this right : america ’s national public radio and the bbc have both recently hacked the sea level , while mcdonald ’s and burger king recently had their twitter accounts compromised . the proliferation of security lapses means that people are more likely to shrug their shoulders , rather than cast their first stone at a company that breaks out . the proliferation of security lapses means that people are more likely to shrug their shoulders , rather than cast early stone at a company that corrupts . finally , the ap is unlikely to confront financial sanctions for that mistake . because few mechanisms can halt the proliferation of hoaxed tweets , and given the high-profile response that successful hackers can expect , twitter will remain a vehicle for malicious hoaxes , even as technology barriers force attacks on more challenges .
detection implies determining whether an extreme event becomes part of usual weather fluctuations , or a symptom of a deeper , long-lasting event . several detailed studies of last year have shown that researchers may indeed be able to detect long-term climatic changes in the rising frequency of extreme events , such as heat waves , heavy rains , severe droughts , and powerful storms . by using cutting-edge climate models , scientists are not only detecting a prolonged period of climate change ; they are also attributing at least some of the more extreme events to human causes . new science of detection and attribution is grounding our knowledge – and also giving us an even sharper cause for concern . detection implies determining whether an extreme event is really part of routine weather fluctuations , or a symptom of a deeper , long-lasting change .
the peer review process to which the g-20 countries have agreed is a critical component in a rebalancing program , for it is where pieces of a cooperative growth strategy will be identified , evaluated , and assembled . if it works , what will emerge will be g-20 countries ’ commitments to pledge policies that are globally beneficial – on the condition that others keep their commitments . in fact , rebalancing is not the only cooperative imperative , but it is . the international exchange-rate system , after all , has been at least partly broken . america can reduce its deficits more rapidly than it would in the non-cooperative circumstances , but only if surplus countries work to reduce their excess savings .
and , indeed , taming big tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the united states . in particular , senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren , reflecting the two strongest candidates vying for the democratic party ’s nomination to challenge us president donald trump , have called for the disruption of major tech firms . but the solutions being proposed , including by legal scholars such as larry khan , tend to focus on making better use of antitrust laws . given the power of big tech firms to stoke competition , reversing these trends will require government intervention . that approach is unlikely to work , because markets have changed dramatically since antitrust laws were conceived .
during each of my field visits , i marvel at how these efforts affect women ’s lives . on one recent trip , i met rasmata , a young mother who told me that , because of her savings net , she was managing to support her family despite her husband of emigration abroad , her father ’s recent death and lingering drought . she was diversifying her incomes , managing her finances , and even adopting climate-smart farming techniques . the best part was that she described herself as a “ hard-working , respectful , rigorous , rigorous , and ambitious woman . ” those are the adjectives that women everywhere , no matter their financial situational or educational , deserve to ascribe to themselves .
if you are a prudent and prudent investor , contemplate that possibility . stock values in the fossil-fuel industry , based on the assumption that companies will be able to extract and burn away from any known reserves , plummet . investing in these firms , it turns out , is extraordinarily risky . that reality implies another compelling case for divestment . investing in those firms , it turns out , is extraordinarily risky .
the ensuing quarter-century was a period of liberal rules-based multilateralism . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the ensuing soviet collapse , that g2 gave way to the g1 +n order , in which all other countries ( n ii ) could not rival america as the sole global superpower . america broadly championed that order , the 2003 iraq war being a clear exception , and , like most countries , benefited enormously from globalization and the emergence of a new , complex set of value chains . democratic and market-based capitalism took a seemingly triumphed over what francis fukuyama called the “ end of history . ” it became clear only in the late 1970s and 1980s that the soviet system was unable to compete with market capitalism .
russia ’s economy has come under severe strain , owing to western sanctions over crimea . instead , after four years of falling real incomes , the government has announced a deeply unpopular pension reform that included an increase in the retirement age . with few rallying public opinion options , putin may well have decided that it is time to “ remind ” russians that they are under assault . resolving russian ’ economic grievances wo n’t be easy , either . russia ’s state-capitalist model has led to weak competition and declining incentives for private investment and entrepreneurship .
this stands in stark contrast with other features of the european union ’s agenda . first , the eu member states declare that they want to develop a common european foreign policy . at maastricht in 1991 , they established new institutions for doing just that ; and last year they ostensibly strengthened those institutions . yet in practice there has been no detectable progress . the goal of economic and monetary union and a single currency , enacted at maastricht in 1991 , is a daring , even revolutionary agenda ; some critics say reckless ; but the reality is that the single currency will be a reality in just two months ’ time .
but broad international support will not be forthcoming unless military operations are perceived as a few form of western neo-imperialism . only an explicitly up-front endorsement of a reformed un security council can provide the legitimacy , and international support that military action – with the possible exception of self-defense – demands . this last point has been at the heart of the problems in iraq . augmenting the us and british troops with other “ western ” forces would not , above all , change a fundamental perception of that us intervention , both within and outside of the arab world . only an explicit , up-front endorsement of a reformed un security council can provide the legitimacy , and international support that military action – with the possible exception of self-defense – will remain necessary .
meanwhile , civil war is raging in syria , accompanied by a potential humanitarian disaster . syria ’s balkanization among the country ’s heterogeneous ethnic and religious groups is an obvious predictable result . indeed , a bosnia-type scenario can no longer be ruled out , while the prospect that the syrian government ’s loss of control over its chemical weapons poses the immediate threat of a military intervention by turkey , israel , or the american people . to be sure , president bashar al-assad ’s regime will not survive , but it is determined to fight iran militarily until the end . to be sure , president bashar al-assad ’s regime will not survive , but it is determined to fight until after the end .
today , government budget allocations are among the leading source of media revenue . for decades , governments have played a major role in domestic media , employing broadcasting frequencies and licensing requirements to shape the market . and yet , in recent years , even as governments have stepped up their budgetary hold , they have only been deepening the industry ’s woes . in newsrooms from serbia to south africa , taxpayer-generated funding has been growing . unfortunately , while that windfall might place more programming on the airport , it merely deepened the industry ’s woes .
as a result , international law came to recognize the “ right of protection ” ” ” against sovereign arbitrariness and states ’ crimes against their own peoples , though enforcement remains fairly precarious . the following great step was the establishment of the notion of humanitarian intervention after the genocide in rwanda and the balkan wars of the 1990 ’s . this development was anything but accidental . as a result , international law came to recognize the reality of modernity , that the strength of states and their rulers should be subject to greater law enforcement , thereby putting individual rights above sovereign sovereignty – a great deal forward . finally , to a similar extent in politics and international law , it led the way in creating the international tribunal for justice .
the winner – a strategy most likely to produce a cooperative outcome – was the anatol rapoport ’s tit-for-tat ( tft ) strategy . according to the tft approach , a bilateral game should start with collaboration : if another player behaves cooperatively , so should you . only when the other player defects – that is , that is , beginning to depict non-cooperative behavior – should you do the same . axelrod hosted tournaments among prominent game theorists and political scientists to identify the most effective approach in a repeat game of prisoner ’s dilemma . of course , when the latter player works , that may be enticing a defect to raise one ’s own payoff and , potentially even securing a windfall .
despite rhetoric about “ inclusive growth , ” india ’s ” wealth gap has widened during a period of exceptionally rapid economic expansion . as for the threat from the right , anyone hopes for regional peace and reduced tensions within india among religious communities is relief for defeating the defeat of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) . the bjp ’s ’s strategy of painting the us congress as soft on terror , and has demonizing muslims as an existential threat to india have badly misenforced . at the same time , the majority of the world ’s malnourished children live in india . sadly , however , the economic trajectory that congress is plotting , though might well boost short-term growth , is ultimately on a collision course with both equity and sustainability .
but it is rather obvious that , even in the 1970s , there was not enough empirical evidence to support friedman ’s thought to justify their increasing dominance . admitting that the monetarist cure was insufficient would have required mainstream economists to swim against the neoliberal currents of our age . and , indeed , there can be no denying friedman ’s cure proven insufficient to respond to the great recession , powerfully suggesting that it would have gone similarly short of tried during the great depression . the dominance of friedman ’s thought at the start of the great recession had less to do with the evidence backing them , than if the science of economics was all too often tainted by politics . in that case , the contamination was such that policymakers were reluctant to go beyond friedman and apply keynesian and minskyite policies on a large enough scale to address the problems that the great recession has presented .
berlin – ever since the global financial crisis erupted in september 2008 , the european union has been in turmoil . by one hand , europe had protected the eurozone , notably germany ’s export economy , from speculative attacks , and the mayhem of currency volatility . on the other hand , the second stage of the crisis mercilessly exposed the euro ’s achilles ’ achilles heel : the absence of economic or financial unification within the eurozone . rising intra-european tensions were by far the inevitable result . germany ’s much-maligned actions in the rest of the crisis have been left largely contradictory .
furthermore , sudanese security forces continue to arm the arab tribes straddling the north-south frontier with the goal of destabilizing the predominantly christian south . after all , the repressive nature of the regime in khartoum is at the root of the many conflicts that have torn the country apart . sudan ’s commitment to the cpa has always been equivocal . if the government in khartoum persists in undermining the reform process and derailing a referendum on self-determination promised for the south in january 2011 , a return to full-scale civil war , with calamitous consequences for peoples in sudan and the entire region – a real possibility . indeed , since the civil war ended in 2005 , sudan ’s people ’s liberation army ( spla ) in the south has frequently had to confront the militias that operate as government proxies .
one approach is to capture co2 in a coal-fired power plant , as the combustion of coal or gas is burned . another is to capture it directly from the air using specially designed chemical processes . but this technology , called carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) , has yet to be proven on a large scale . ( hydroelectric power generation emits no co2 , but there are only a few remaining areas in the world where it can be expanded without major environmental or social costs . ) the other is to capture it directly from the air using specially designed chemical processes .
such patterns can arouse worries among shareholders that pay structures are not well designed to serve their own interests . distinguishing between the two sources of concern about pay in financial firms is important . in the us post-crisis finance order , governments must assume the role of monitoring and regulation of pay in financial firms ; conversely , perverse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily recur . one set of concerns appears to be arising from a shareholder perspective . figures recently released by the new york times ’ attorney general , andrew cuomo , indicate that more than nine large financial firms disbursed their employees aggregate compensation above $ 600 billion in 2003-2008 , a period in which their stock-market capitalization declined substantially .
it is time to call a spade a spade : the republican party is overwhelmingly responsible for it . consider the question of “ bump ’s stocks , ” gun-slinging that the culprit in the las vegas massacre had used it to fire faster . some republican senators have now drawn pussy riot for indicating that they will support an instrument ban . but when democratic senator diana proposed a similar ban in 2013 , the republicans overwhelmingly opposed it . it is time to call a spade a spade : the republican party is overwhelmingly responsible .
by 2000 , that share had fallen to around 22 % , and by 2010 , to around 11 % , with little more than 3 % of living in outright destitution . as a result , demands for more opportunities and better living conditions have grown louder . chileans are clamoring for adequate housing , access to improved health services , a safer environment , and access to higher education – the single most critical factor in social advancement . the 29 % of the population that have been left out of poverty are now the mediterranean middle class , with its new aspirations and goals . chile today is very different from chile 20 years ago .
true , clinton offers many programs that she would squeeze as president ; but , to borrow from winston churchill , there is no theme to her pudding . after all , clinton is the only person well known to have initiated her campaign twice . true , clinton is now offering plenty of programs to pressure as president ; but , to borrow from winston churchill , there is no theme to her pudding . success in america ’s presidential politics requires some superb intuition , being quick on one of the legs , and most importantly , a compelling rationale for running . true , clinton is the only person well known to have initiated her campaign twice .
not only a year ago , at the imf ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s annual meeting in washington , dc , senior staff told anyone who would listen that europe ’s entire sovereign-debt panic was a tempest in a teapot . exploiting slick powerpoint presentations with a degree like “ default in today ’s advanced economies ” : unnecessary , undesirable , and unlikely , the fund was trying to persuade investors that eurozone debt was fixed like a rock . even for greece , the imf argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , owing to anticipated growth and reform . never mind the fund ’s obvious flaw , namely that countries like greece and portugal face policy and perform risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies like germany and the united states . as the situation deteriorated , one may have guessed that the imf would label its beliefs to the market as it did , accepting a more cautious tone .
another alternative , backed by a large and growing body of research into economics and psychology , is a direct way to measure well-being or happiness . surveys of reported levels of wellbeing are now available for much of the world nowadays , and the thought of offshoring by using that as prosperity metrics have strong advocates . happiness surveys in rich countries , for example , typically exhibit a score of six or seven on a 0-10 scale . but there has several drawbacks , including an increasing body of welfare indicators altering little over time . one way to make such indicators more politically relevant would be to track ways that people use their time and attach wellbeing to each .
the “ big bang for of 1986 , ” which de-regulated financial services rendered risky behavior within the city ’s norm . those reforms sowed the seeds of the 2008 financial crisis . her “ big bang ” of 1986 , which de-regulated financial services rendered risky behavior by the city-state ’s norm . such reforms sowed the seeds of the 2008 financial crisis . the shift toward the funding that thatcher promoted heightened inequality , making the economy more volatile .
yes , it has made important strides in improving its understanding of the relationship between financial markets and the real economy . and , yes , it has validated the lead in shining more light on the economic impact of gender inequality and the challenges of climate change . but its forward-looking analyses have all too often turned out to be backward-looking , and its quantitative projections have consistently been subject to significant structural revisions . even more worryingly , the fund ’s policy recommendations , particularly those pertaining to the advanced economies , have little impact ( actually , to have it politely ) . yes , it has committed important strides in advancing its understanding of the relationship between financial markets and the real economy .
this is particularly necessary because women ’s situation is one of the leading benchmarks that the outside world , and especially for the west , uses to assess the arab world . and , unfortunately , such assessments tend to focus on the supposed imsm that derives from islamic norms , which obscures the knowledge of the real changes that are taking . indeed , the predominant view in arab societies has often stifles outsiders ’ ability to break free of their belief that islam confines all arab women to the same extent when , in reality , they experience very different conditions . as a result , the west risks depriving itself of an important key to its understanding of the arab world today and as it will endure tomorrow . this prevents many from seeing , much less evaluate , the deep changes that occur in arab societies , and how women drive those changes forward .
in the london crowd , the american sociologist david riesman has identified three broad cultural types : tradition-directed cultures that look at inherited rituals , morals and guidance values ; an inner-directed cultures in which people behave on the basis of self-nourished values ; and other-directed cultures that react predominantly to external norms and peer influences . riesman ’s framework has vast resonance in the arab world today , where rising literacy rates and rapid advances in communications technology have stirred a maelstrom of competing cultural narratives – with its three kinds competing to define the region of the future . ironically , it is the combination of increased literacy and advanced technology that is fanning the flames of conflict between the two kinds of “ reformers ” – religious revivalists and a western-oriented modernizers – that are fanning the flames of conflict between the two kinds of “ reformers ” – religious revivalists and a western-oriented modernizers . taken together , riesman ’s framework has specific resonance in the arab world today , where rising literacy rates and fast advances in communications technology have stirred a maelstrom of competing cultural narratives , with its three species competing to define the region of the future . take advantage of their capabilities in the mass-production and instantly disseminate of ancient religious texts , and western-originating literature , the two camps struggle for the hearts and minds of otherwise traditional societies .
china , for its part , had overshot japan as the world ’s second-largest economy . yet china ’s model of authoritarian efficiency seemed appealing to many other developing countries , particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis , which began in the united states , and seemed to discredit the “ american-style liberal capitalism . ” until recently , there was very little cause to question such a question . in fact , hundreds of millions of chinese had entered the middle class , most of them in 90 years . china had overtaken japan as the world ’s second-largest economy .
there are good reasons why america adopted policies that encouraged poorer countries to grow rapidly through export-led industrialization . there are good reasons why america ’s acceptance of policies that encouraged poorer countries to grow fast through export-led industrialization . the reason that this narrative is mistaken is fairly straightforward . in helping mexico , brazil , and other developing countries to grow , america is catching up with the world ’s wealthier trade partners . moreover , there is a strong case for america ’s adoption of policies that encouraged poorer countries to grow rapidly through export-led industrialization .
according to an as-yet-unpublished european central bank survey of 65,000 eurozone citizens , nearly 80 % of all point-of-sale transactions take place in cash ; and more than half of all payments are made in cash . but there is an open question whether the still highly fragmented digital-payment sector will help customers even more than the companies that offer pay solutions . as is often the case in europe , disparities among member states are pronounced : the share of cash transactions ranges ranges from 42 % in finland to 92 % in malta . but , globally , the public ’s commitment to cash remains strong . there is one more important problem with the arguments for a cashless society : most people , at least in the eurozone , do not want it .
tel aviv – the crisis in the sinai peninsula appears to have dwarfs sunday ’s drama in cairo . earlier this month , the jihadi terrorists ambushed an egyptian military base in sinai , killing 16 egyptian soldiers . they then hijacked two armored personnel carriers and sped up toward their frontier with israel . yet egyptian president mohamed morsi ’s civilian overthrow , in which he dismissed general mohamed hussein tantawi , the army ’s leader , has not diminished the importance of the trouble there . one vehicle has failed to break through the porous border crossings ; another penetrated israeli territory before being stopped by israel ’s militant forces ( idf ) .
cptpp and ceta member states recognize that the global trading system has difficulties , including from incomplete or antiquated rules that do not account for issues like subsidies to soes . but they also know that bilateralism , small countries trying to negotiate on a level playing field with the superpowers , is not really an option . a commitment to multilateralism is not an endorsement of the status quo . but as countries that rely largely on active diplomacy and soft power , they have everything they can lose from a protracted and escalating geopolitical conflict , in which they would come under pressure to pick sides . to defend their interests , they must ensure that global trade falls under objective dispute-settlement mechanisms .
grassroots assessments of progress against these indicators are intended to complement the government-led reporting mechanism . meanwhile , ghana and benin emphasize budget spending that has a high sdg 16 impact ; and ghana ’s ’s government has also publicly discloses how closely its financial priorities are aligned with its day-to-day decision-making . in kenya , all of the public-sector officials in 16-related ministries , departments , and agencies are obligated to sign performance treaties with the central government , in which they identify sdg 16 targets and indicators relevant to their mandates , and explain these being integrated into political and development plans . finally , some african “ 16 champions ” are making the target central to national planning , budgeting , and reporting . moreover , a few countries have found innovative ways to ensure that governments use new nationally led sdg 16 data in their everyday decision-making .
on the global level , it is hard to argue that inequality is one of the world ’s great political-economic problems . it is hard , at least to me , to envision alternative political arrangements or economic policies over the last fifty years that would transfer any significant part of today ’s rich nations to today ’s impoverished peoples . on the global level , it is hard to argue that inequality is one of the world ’s great political-economic problems . but the alternatives that would make the south richer at the price of shrinking the north ’s wealth need for a wholesale revolution in human psychology . i can also envision alternatives that would have enriched the poor peoples : deng xiaoping became china ’s leader in 1956 rather than 1976 would have done the job there .
repayment on griesa ’s terms would devastate argentina ’s economy . other holdouts ( 6.6 % of the total lenders ) would receive an additional $ 15 billion . nml capital and the other vultures comprise just 1 % of creditors ’ average annual per capita income , but would receive another $ 1.5 trillion . and , because a debt restructuring stipulated by whatever the creditors who accepted it could demand the same terms as holdouts receive , argentina might be in the hook , at $ 140 billion cost . repayment on griesa ’s terms would devastate argentina ’s economy .
doing so will be essential after bali to reflect seriously on the next stage of the wto and its role in the international trading system . the major international finance institutions , the international monetary fund , the world bank , the european bank for reconstruction and development , and the regional development banks , all of which are having to work hard on their own to fit the twenty-first century . until we reverse the trend toward declining multilateralism , governments ’ capacity to respond to the global challenges will not improve . doing so will be essential after bali to reflect seriously on the next phase for the wto and its role in the international trading system . the imf ’s authority has frayed .
economists and moralists were united in the belief that you were really willing to spend less than you earning – in order to “ save ” the debt for the proverbial rainy day or the old age . and , if a person had become indebted , it was a point of honor to repay an obligation when it came due , by selling assets , driving down consumption , working harder , or some combination of the three . indeed , it was often more than a point of honor : the failure to repay debt on time landed the borrower in prison . so the same attitudes governed the limits of institutional debt . getting into debt was long associated with pre-profligacy or fecklessness .
though china ’s ’s economic renaissance had already begun under deng xiaoping , the chinese communist party ( ccp ) , following the end of 1989 , was able publicly to subservient ideology to generate wealth creation . more broadly , a emblematic defeat of marxism in 1989 enabled asian countries , including china and india , to pursue their capitalist policies on a greater scale . geopolitically , post-tiananmen gains extended well beyond the west . the soviet union ’s abrupt collapse was strategic boon to asia , eliminating an sinister empire , and opening the way for china to begin to pursue its own interests globally . geopolitically , the post-1989 gains extended far beyond the west .
similarly , rather than condemning the taliban ’s acceptance of terrorist tactics by the taliban in afghanistan , boko haram in nigeria and al-shabaab in somalia , and destroying sufi shrines in mali by ansar dine , a radical islamist sect , muslims have remained largely silent . in egypt , with its 10 % coptic orthodox minority , the muslim brotherhood ’s mohamed morsi won the presidency in a free and fair election after which morsi resigned from the party , stating that this would enable him to represent all egyptians more effectively , promising that he will respect minority rights . yet the subsequent actions designed to give him an unprecedented degree of executive power are raising concerns about these early positive steps . developments following the arab spring may have provided some indication of the outlook for religious tolerance . while none of these groups represent a majority , they do exert significant influence , and presumably believe that they act in the majority ’s interest .
today , many of those responsible for the decision to crack down – notably , deng xiaoping and others among the party elders – have died . this group will unite around the forces of democratization both at home and abroad to establish a genuinely democratic system . fourth , reversal of the verdict on june 4th creates historical inevitability , as does the wish of a majority of china ’s people . indeed , the party ’s top-down leadership has split the event ever since . this group will unite with forces of democratization both at home and abroad to establish a genuinely democratic system .
in particular , the absence of a domestic currency means that italians can not choose their own inflation target or devalue their currency vis-à-vis foreign currencies . it has also undertook specific pledges with respect to the behavior of italy ’s fiscal policies , though such constraints are not as “ tough ” as those of framing monetary policy . these types of obligations place the true limits on italy ’s macroeconomic policy choices . by joining the eu , italy has surrendered monetary sovereignty to an external , independent decision-maker , the european central bank . it has also undertook concrete commitments with respect to the conduct of its fiscal policies , although such constraints are not as “ as “ tough ” as those framing monetary policy .
in the darkness , congested alleys of lahore , karachi , peshawar , or quetta , the yearnings are not for democratic liberalism , but for believers to unite behind a single true faith . in any contest of ideas , the extremes will usually triumph over a moderate . in pakistan , the extremist now wears an islamic garb and stands for the creator , an faith , and a theocratic world . in any contest of ideas , the extremes will usually triumph over a moderate . what , incidentally , might the pakistan liberal stand for ?
japan , for example , has rather rigid laws protecting the animals ’ welfare . such laws resemble the regulations that were first implemented by much abattoirs in the industrialized world , which require that animals be stunned – rendered unconscious with sea and insensitive to the pain – at which they have their throats and are poplowed out . there are strong grounds for believing that they should do so . there are , of course , where the stunning fails and wildlife kill while fully conscious ; but , when stunning works properly , it cuts the animal ’ suffering . japan , for example , has rather rigid laws protecting the animals ’ welfare .
cambridge – us president donald trump ’s critics have steadily underestimated his political communication skills , perhaps owing to such differences from predecessors like franklin d. roosevelt and ronald reagan . both fdr and reagan , after all , were known as “ great communicators . ” trump , on the other hand , appealed mainly to the minority that elected him . his inaugural address sounded like a campaign speech ; and , having received office , a series of misleading statements and provocative executive orders undercut his credibility with the center but strengthened it with his base . both fdr and reagan , after all , were known as “ great communicators . ”
greece is admittedly a less obvious case ; but , considering that many impoverished african countries were able to contain inflation well within the single digits , one could presume that greece would manage as well . far more important to achieve price stability was the reinstatement of a modern , independent central bank , a facility that helped dramatically lower inflation levels worldwide . it is very likely that if , instead of joining the euro , italy , and spain had simply granted their central banks more autonomy , they , too , would now have low inflation today . indeed , with the southern european countries keeping their own currencies afloat , they might never have dug in as large a debt hole , and would have the chance of a partial default via inflation . yes , a few locations like venezuela still have double-digit price growth , but these are now rand .
cohn ’s sin was to allow it to be known publicly that he almost resigned following the violence last month in charlottesville , va. cohn ’s sin was to let it be known publicly that he almost resigned in the wake of the violence last month in charlottesville , va. in fact , one can have some sympathy for a president with an aide who wishes to have it both ways , as cohn did – letting his apparent anguish be known without acting on the basis of him . but problems can arise when a president chooses to disregard his chief economic adviser . speculation about the possibility of the “ new trump ” ” ” ” peaked in early september , when the president-elect suddenly cut deals with democratic congressional leaders .
on may 17 , the advocacy organization oxfam america has sued america ’s securities and exchange commission to issue the ultimate rule implementing section 1504 of the 2010 dodd-frank wall street reform and the consumer protection act . mineral and hydrocarbon deposits are often located in less-developed countries suffering from pre-existing governance constraints , political instability , and major developmental and ecological challenges . but the risks are just as true as potential rewards . as it stands , resource industries are persistent sources of poverty , conflict , and degradation . as it stands , transparency – full disclosure of everything from contracts to revenue management and environmental commitments – is critical to realizing the sector ’s economic potential and avoiding conflict and breakdown .
indeed , scores of people fly between accra , lagos , freetown , monrovia , or abidjan and new delhi , mumbai , calcutta , or chennai on a daily basis , transiting through the middle east or europe , could one day make a trip to india without triggering alarms . indeed , scores of people fly between accra , lagos , freetown , monrovia , or abidjan and new delhi , mumbai , calcutta , or chennai on a daily basis , transiting through the middle east or europe . it seems unlikely that india ’s government can still tabs on all the arrivals of west africa . links to west africa are nearing and go again over the past century , with almost 50,000 indians or some of india ’s people living in the region . it seems unlikely that india ’s government can still tabs on all of the arrivals of west africa .
new york – british prime minister david cameron ’s government has announced some of the most draconian public-sector reductions any advanced country government has ever attempted . indeed , his education minister recently proclaimed that finance for britain ’s universities would slashed by as much as 40 % . the war against the arts and humanities is nothing new , although that is the first time that the fighting has migrated so directly to britain . ronald reagan pioneered a wave of policies and propaganda in the united states in the 1980 ’s that demonized a national endowment for the arts . but the most conscience-shocking aspect of the move is that both arts and humanities departments will be targeted more aggressively than what science and engineering are supposedly better for business .
when i visited tripoli in march 2010 for a “ national reconciliation conference , ” conflicting statements put forward by saif al-islam and security officials surprised me . the head of the internal security forces , colonel al-tuhami khaled , another principal suspect in the crimes that are currently committed against libyans have refused to call the process a “ reconciliation ” with them . for him , this has been “ repentance from a heresy . ” given the recent waves of uprisings , it is more apparent than ever that any “ reform of the ” ” initiatives carried out in the arab world were previously intended only to sustaining repressive dictatorships and to escape punishment for criminal abuses of power . given the recent waves of uprisings , it is more obvious than ever that any of the “ reform ” initiatives carried out in the arab world were previously intended only to sustaining repressive dictatorships and to escape punishment for criminal abuses of power .
sufficiently high rates will induce commercial banks to prefer the fed to a combination of liquidity , safety , and yields to expand the supply of private lending . what if that credit expands too quickly , the fed may raise the interest rate that it pays on its deposits . that , at any rate , is theory ; no one knows how it would work in practice . how high would the fed – or the ecb , for that matter – have to raise the interest rate on deposits in order to prevent an excessive buildup of bank lending ? what if that interest rate had to be 4 % or 6 % or even 8 % ?
the nature of financial risk continues to converge in ways that are harder to forecast when any country , including the american and chinese , was at risk of crises . they tasked the g20 with developing a set of indicators that would signal when any country , including the american and chinese , was at risk of crises . unfortunately , such early-warning indicators are better at reflecting the last crisis than are the next one . the nature of financial risk continually changes in ways that are harder to forecast using backward-looking indicators , like those that have been devised by the g20 . policymakers at the nanjing had pledged to meet this problem .
moreover , obama has tried to suppress hundreds of photos depicting sexual assault in us-run prisons , doing nothing to roll back the patriot act . why should obama , the constitutional scholar , be backtracked on this path ? first , he does not dare to appear “ soft on terror . ” second , perhaps he needs efforts at guantánamo detainees in rigged setting up , or even keep them out of trial forever : lawyers contend that torture , including sexual torture , has been so endemic at the cia and military that obama might be holding scores , if not hundreds , of prisoners whose crews are a crime show . according to wells nixon , a center lawyer for constitutional rights who represents some of the detainees , the obama administration ca n’t risk calling for torture practices by calling them “ classified sources and methods ” ” that can not be uncovered through prosecution .
if the authorities - explicitly the us federal reserve and the fdic - determine it impossible , they have the legal power to force banks to change how they operate , including by reducing their scale and scope . but the current reality is that no megabank has been able to go bankrupt without creating another “ lehman moment ” ” that is , the kind of global panic that resulted from the days after lehman brothers failed in september 2008 . in particular , experts like hoenig notion of cross-border dimensions of us bankruptcy emphasize that it simply wo n’t work for the company ’s size ( $ 3.7 trillion in assets ) , the bank of america ( $ 3 trillion ) , the bank of america ( $ 3 trillion ) , or citigroup ( $ 2.7 trillion ) . “ panic is about panic , the ” hoenig says , is “ and the people and peoples and nations generally protect themselves and their wealth ahead of others . moreover , there are no international bankruptcy laws to govern such matters and prevent asset grabbing them .
paris – the central paradox of french politics was confirmed anew on march 27 . this discrepancy between the national front ’s popular strength , and its real representation , has been a permanent feature of french politics since jean-marie le pen established the party 40 years ago . but le pen was replaced in january by his no less charismatic daughter , marine . in a nation-wide vote to choose local authorities ( the so named conseiller nérnéral ) , the far-right national front won 11 % of the votes cast but secure only 0.1 % of the seats . and , with that change , the fate of the front may shift .
i believe that the global fund is one of the smartest investments we can make , just as many governments have understood from the start . the global fund has brightened futures for hundreds of thousands of children across africa and asia – a heroic achievement that should make donor countries ’ citizens proud . for example , australia has donated the us to $ 410 million through the global fund since 2002 , an amount that enabled nearly 200,000 people to receive lifesaving hiv treatment , left seven million people to receive tb treatment , and 14 million bed nets that are donated to families in need . the united states has been the global fund to be one of the smartest investments we can make , but many more have done its part . the global fund has brightened the futures of hundreds of thousands of children across africa and asia – a heroic achievement that should make donor countries proud .
new york – everyone – from elected officials and bureaucrats to voters and taxpayers – can learn from the world ’s largest charitable foundations of effective development spending . the united states allocates less than 1 % of the federal aid budget , but the average american believes that the figure will come thirty-one-fold . prior to his election victory , us president donald trump has railed against “ sending foreign aid to countries that hate the us , ” ” ” ” reflecting the widespread belief that aid must be cut . and those lessons are particularly relevant at a time when 56 % of europeans believe that their governments should focus narrowly on domestic issues , letting recipient countries deal with issues as best they can ( aid opposition to be even higher in france , poland , italy , hungary , greece , and greece ) . the united kingdom ’s largest-circulation paper recently initiated a petition calling for an end to ring-fenced aid spending ( worth 0.7 % of national income ) .
as a result , america ’s efforts to give the international effect of its new iran sanctions act constitute a double-whammy for india . but the former fell prey to the long american occupation of afghanistan , and the latter currently faces a us-led trans-pacific export embargo , designed to throttle it financially . second , further isolation of iran will make it extremely difficult for india to play a more active role in afghanistan at a time when america is hastening its military disengagement there and seeking to cut off an agreement with the taliban . first , it threatens to sabotage india ’s energy-import diversification strategy by making it overly dependent on the islamist-bankrolling oil-rich monarchies – including saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , and qatar , all of which have managed to ride out the arab spring . india , one of afghanistan ’s largest aid donors , has no contiguous corridor to that country and has to rely on iran for access .
it would remain valid as long as the u.s. was in a position to increase its quota and recover its voting share . a key obstacle to this proposal is the requirement of congressional approval in order to increase america ’s quota share . this opens the possibility that america ’s voting power could be temporarily down below the 15 % threshold needed to veto decisions requiring the support of 85 % of imf members ’ 85 % of imf votes . such a guarantee could be incorporated into the resolution dividing the reform package . to secure america ’s support , the incoming governors ’ board could commit not to consider any draft decision requiring 85 % of backing without american approval .
the case for openness , inclusion , and diversity within european societies has become much harder . yet , almost six months into the north africa quagmire upheavals , the number of arrivals on the south island of lampedusa has reached roughly 30,000 of its gdp . the case for openness , inclusion , and diversity within european societies has become much harder . italian officials have privately affirmed that current figures are not ungovernable . in fact , by comparison , sweden , with one-sixth of italy ’s population , embraced the same number of asylum-seekers in 2009 .
moreover , germany has much more interior stability than america , for it does n’t have the problem of heavily indebted households that are now restricted in their borrowing . the german state recorded a budget deficit of just 0.1 % of gdp in 2008 , which , according to the oecd ’s latest forecast , will soar to 4.5 % of gdp in 2009 . in the united states , the budget deficit in 2008 stood at 5.8 % of gdp , and , according to the same oecd , will equal 10.2 % of gdp in 2009 , translating into precisely the same economic stimulus as in germany , 4.4 % of gdp . so the economic stimulus provided by germany ’s sovereign budget will total 4.4 % of gdp in 2009 . while this certainly impedes long-term economic growth and poses great structural problems , it also implies that the state reacts extremely counter-cyclically and stabilizing the economy in a way that benefits the entire world .
a few months earlier , the four moved to issue a joint communiqué ahead of the g20 summit in april noting their shared determination to alter the rules of the global economic system . but catchy ideas die hard , and russia has moved to cement the brics ’ current concept into an irreversible reality . ossification of the brics into a de facto global institution move forward dramatically in june , when both four countries have met ( in russia , of course ) for the first “ bric summit . ” this meeting produced a notable broadside against the united states , because each member declared his desire to unseat the us dollar as a global reserve currency . in the private sector , the bric index funds have proliferated , even as goldman sachs has radically hedged its own bric bet by introducing a second term , the “ next 11 , ” or the n-11 , during that discussion .
advocating supply-side economics to the white working class , trump convinced the millions that “ fewer government , ” ” ” which meant cutting federal programs , including in education , would bring “ morning in america . ” his strategic defense initiative , intended to end a multiyear nuclear-deterrence strategy – known as the “ mutual assured destruction ” – was actually nicknamed the “ star wars . ” reagan ’s enduring status as a kind of republican icon had much to do with his skill at dole out cowboy cruelty with movietnamese charm , although good luck also played a role . after all , his victory in the cold war was aided substantially by mikhail gorbachev , whose effort to reform the soviet union was hastened by its collapse . reagan ’s enduring status as a republican icon had much to do with his supposed cowboy cruelty with mois-star charm , although good luck also played a
warsaw – had the august 1991 putsch against mikhail gorbachev not failed , riots and death recently seen in xinjiang may have grabbed headlines in russia . instead of hearing about a crackdown in urumqi , xinjiang ’s capital , may be reading about the hundreds killed in the streets of almaty , and columnists would be making comparisons to the bloody crushing of ukrainian independence demonstrations in lvov a last year . substitute xinjiang for kazakhstan and tibet for ukraine , and you will get the image in it . as with china today , there would have been some feeble international condemnations of the region , and some speculation on potential links between kazakh militants and exile groups or islamic fundamentalists . experts would remind us that kazakhstan was never a country , and that ukraine ’s claims to independence are historically dubious .
so , again , why has the imf been flip ? the answer is obvious : china mounted a full-court press to change the minds . renminbi-denominated government bonds were issued in london , and the schemes were laid out to create new foreign-currency platforms in several european financial centers . in august , the currency ’s exchange-rate regime was turned into a mildly attest . and chinese policymakers made it abundantly clear how unhappy they would be with wrong-headed decisions .
but foreign import barriers and us exports subsidies are not the reason for america ’s trade deficit . the overall trade deficit is a direct result of america ’s saving and investment decisions . the reason why americans ’ saving and investment decisions are driving the overall trade deficit is straightforward : if a country saves more of its total output than it invests in business equipment and structures , it has the extra output that it sells to the rest of the world . the policies of foreign governments affect only how the deficit divides among america ’s trading partners . the real reason for this is that americans spend more than they produce .
judging by the blizzard of policy tweaks since the announcement , it seems clear that no impact study has been on the downside . yet , rather than recognize the mounting risks of the non-transparent policy environment that he has generated , modi has been discussing going even further , moving india toward a entirely “ cashless society . ” nor has there been any “ policy skeleton , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” cost-benefit analysis , and no evidence that alternative policy options were ever deemed . yet the truth is that his design has been fundamentally flawed . many modi supporters argue that demonetization politics are a result of inept performance .
washington , dc – terrorism on the scale witnessed in paris last month is nothing new in africa . in nigeria , cameroon , chad , and niger , the extremist group boko haram notorious for its abduction of 276 school girls in 2013 and garissa university in 2015 , as well as many diminishing acts of terror . in nigeria , cameroon , chad , and niger , the extremist group boko haram , notorious for its abduction of 276 school girls in 2013 , has inflicted thousands of casualties with suicide bombings and a assailant attack on civilians . meanwhile in tunisia , the islamic state has targeted their tourists , orchestrating attacks on a museum and beach resort . in kenya , the somali group al-shabaab has carried out two high-profile assaults , nairobi ’s double shopping mall in 2013 and garissa university in 2015 , as well as many diminishing acts of terror .
royal perks include lifetime sinecures and civil-service domination , enabling princes to award contracts and to receive commissions on top of their salaries . so the saudi regime is split , its legitimacy is being questioned , and sectarian tensions are rising . that is no longer true of the many princes it has produced . indeed , with the royals ’ ratio to commoners now at $ one in 1,000 ( compared to one in five million in the united kingdom ) , the challenge to manage the princely privileges , pay compensation , and job demands have never been more intense . as the elderly generation dies , new generations have gone to the fighting before customers .
london – julius nyerere , tanzania ’s first president , once asked his country of its creditors a blunt question : “ must we starve our children to solicit our our debt ? ” over the past year , an unprecedented humanitarian effort has pulled somalia back from the brink of famine . that was , in 1986 , on the eve of public campaigns and initiatives that have stripped much of africa ’s crushing and unpayable debt burden . but nyerere ’s question still hangs like a dark cloud over somalia . as the worst drought in living memory has devastated harvests and decimated livestock , almost $ 1 billion has been mobilized in emergency aid to nutrition , health , and clean water provision .
one is whether the fed will truly exit the exit from qe as soon as it signaled . there is a strong likelihood that the weaker american growth and lower inflation will force it to slow the pace of its withdrawal of liquidity support . the fallout – sharp capital-flow reversals that are now hitting all of the risky emerging-market assets – has not been pretty . brazil and other countries that have complained about “ hot money ” inflows , and the “ currency wars , ” have now suddenly gotten what they wanted : the likely premature end of the fed ’s qe . whether the correction in risky assets is temporary , or the advent of a bear market will depend on several factors .
berkeley – since late 2014 , we have been advocating a model for america ’s governance based on the tenth amendment to the american constitution , which states that “ powers n’t delegated to the united states by the constitution , nor prohibited by us states , are reserved to the states of the land ” or to the people . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . increasingly , california has been exercising such constitutional rights in its own hands . the recently discovered killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
europe is slipping back into recession just when recovery in the united states is finally gaining some traction . i moderated a session on “ a new context in east asia , ” addressed by a panel of senior us representatives from thailand , south korea , malaysia , singapore , and japan . i could not resist the temptation to draw asia into the discussion . with the exception of the japan participant , all went unnoticed by the devastating asian financial crises of the late 1990s . still , i took away at a different conclusion from davos .
big scientific minds have learned over many decades to “ read ” earth ’s history to understand how the climate system works . they have deployed brilliant physics , biology , and instrumentation ( for example , satellites reading detailed traits of earth ’s systems ) to advance our understanding . and the message is clear : large-scale use of oil , coal , and gas threatens the planet ’s biology and chemistry . the ipcc and climate scientists tell us a crucial message . we are fueling dangerous change in earth ’s climate and ocean chemistry , giving rise to extreme storms , droughts , and other hazards that will damage the quality of food and the planet ’s quality of life .
some integration advocates view the united states as a powerful american partner . others are motivated by a desire to establish a rival center of power , however unrealistic this appears . having become militarily irrelevant , europeans argue , it is not surprising that europeans emphasize diplomacy , rather than a military might , settle disputes . on the other hand , no one should be surprised that americans chafe at constraints on their ability to seize america ’s military hegemony . some commentators have started pointing to america ’s different views of america and europe on the role of international law , unlike the use of force in dispute resolution .
moscow – the georgia crisis last august tested europe ’s security system , and the system failed to live up to its fundamental task of securing common security for the continent as a whole . the european union believes that the russian initiative is well grounded , and has shown an interest in launching such a project . even before the georgian crisis , russia has already seen the need to revisit europe ’s european security mechanisms – including its international and regional institutions and their very functions . we have suggested a new , legally binding eu treaty system for mutual security guarantees in order to ensure equal security across europe . as a result , europe needs to revisit europe ’s existing security arrangements , analyze what happened , and take this analysis in account when reforming those arrangements .
princeton – should rallies by neo-nazis and white supremacists meet for violence ? that question arose with the tragic events in charlottesville , virginia , on august 12 . white supremacists maintained a rally to protest the scheduled removal of the public park of the statue of robert e. lee , the leader of a confederate army during the civil war . a counterprotest was orchestrated , and the street fighting broke out across the country . a woman , heather heyer , was killed , and 19 people injured as the james field , the white nation-state , drove his car at high speed into the crowd of counterprotesters .
and wen indicated that the village elections could be extended to their next highest level of government , township offices – over the next couple of years . the zeguo exercise was regarded as overwhelmingly successful and was replicated elsewhere in china . china ’s humble experiments with local elections supplemented exercises in “ deliberative democracy . ” and wen indicated that the village elections could be extended to their next highest degree of government , township offices , – over the next couple of years . chinese officials used to hire stanford university professor james fishkin to design a representative sample of citizens from the zeguo for an assembly using keypad polling devices and handheld computers to decide how the city should spend a $ 6 million public-works budget .
working together could enable the use of affordable , sophisticated seafood technology for seafood traceability – data-gathering data and intelligence gathering that helps pinpoint exactly where and when and by whom it has been caught . such efforts – for example , the electronic documentation scheme for the atlantic bluefin tuna catches – represent one of the most effective tools for eliminating illicit fishing . already , european regulators have introduced sophisticated monitoring and surveillance programs , blocked market access for countries with records of illicit fishing , penalized european rogue operators , and helped to encourage “ yellow or red carded ” countries reform their fisheries laws . the eu , japan , and america would be even more efficient if they aligned their policies to ensure that criminals are access to their markets , and enabled legitimate players to benefit from “ supercharged ” levels of access . eliminating rogue fishing will help replenish marine life and ensure the food and livelihoods of billions of people .
but the urban poor , faced with bad housing , limited infrastructure , and meager services , remain vulnerable to epidemics , malnutrition-based childhood diseases , hiv/aids , malaria , tuberculosis , and mental illnesses . indeed , many potential solutions stem from innovation opportunities created by people ’s physical concentration and economic activity . but a recent oxford university symposium concluded that emerging-market cities could improve and sustain urban health by capturing the inherent advantages of concentration , coordinating health policies and programs , embracing successful innovations , reforming health education and training , and developing better planning processes . they are also likely to be hardest hit by natural disasters like the floods and mudslides that devastated parts of rio de janeiro in january . a second generic feature of emerging-market cities is that the dense concentration of poverty helps create fragile environments that spawn civil disorder , leading to deaths and injuries .
this was followed by myrna mack ’s decision in june 2001 , which made it possible during the last to present the evidence against such individuals . regrettably , the trial indefinitely delayed because defendants ’ lawyers appealed the case . the courts ’ actions represent guatemala ’s first effort to bring high military officials to trial . our successes under myrna mack are notable , but achieving them has proved difficult : the police courts have been assassinated ; the judges have been threatened ; and witnesses have fled into exile . finally , i have been harassed and campaigns to discredit me organized .
that has certainly not happened at last year ’s un climate change conference in katowice , poland . some major economies – including canada , ireland , the united kingdom , as well as regions and towns – have now officially recognized the scale of the crisis . the question is whether this will translate into a commitment to take urgent action . proponents of geoengineering are right about one thing : we are confronting the climate emergency demanding radical and urgent action . the un ’s intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) made this starkly apparent in october 2018 , reinforcing the point last month with its report on climate change and land .
with the uk and germany currently incapable of playing a major diplomatic role , and italy , spain , and poland in no position to be principal players in the eu , finding it quite simple : in part through default , and in part owing to its young president ’s sheer energy and imagination , that is france ’s moment . meanwhile , germany , european power with its closest historical and cultural relationship with russia , is at the bottom of the political cycle . it is both dangerous and unfair to understate german chancellor angela merkel ; but she no longer has the clout or energy to lead europe in her dealings with the outside world , or to rally the europeans themselves . finally , macron ’s attempt to reset relations with russia is perfectly in tune with france ’s gaullist tradition . mediating between different systems and looking beyond the current incarnation of other countries was charles de gaulle ’s natural instinct .
they understood that a democratic country would need the space to conduct an independent monetary and fiscal policy altogether . thus , john maynard keynes , writing rules along with harry dexter mies white , viewed capital controls not as a temporary adjustment but as an enduring feature of the global economy . the bretton woods regime collapsed in the 1970s , owing to the failure or unwillingness of the imf – it is not exactly obvious which – of leading governments to manage the rising tide of capital inflows . they understood that a democratic country would need the space to conduct an independent monetary and fiscal policy altogether . the third path identified by the trilemma is to do away with national sovereignty altogether .
over time , however , better attribution of forensics can enhance the role of punishment ; and improved defenses through encryption or machine-learning may enhance the role of prevention and denial . what ’s more , as states and organizations come to understand the better the constraints and uncertainties of cyberattacks , and the increasing importance of internet entanglement to their own economic well-being , cost-benefit calculations of cyberwarfare can change . in any case , strategic stability in cyberspace will be difficult to sustain . but if that makes traditional arms-control treaties impossible to verify , perhaps limits on certain types of civilian ( rather than guns ) can still be established , and negotiate rough codes of the type of road that reduces conflict . furthermore , as states and organizations come to understand better the limitations and uncertainties of cyberattacks and the increasing importance of internet entanglement to their own economic well-being , cost-benefit calculations of cyberwarfare can change .
in georgia , by contrast , russia moved from supporting territorial integrity to cracking down on the country in the next three weeks , to relying entirely on military force to do so . even then , the us agreed to another four eu-russia negotiations , designed to ensure that no stone was left unturned in the search for a mutually acceptable compromise . the conflict in georgia was followed by a sharp decline in investor confidence . likewise , the us decision to recognize kosovo ’s independence came only after russia made clear that it would veto a deal proposed by un secretary general anders fogh ahtisaari . for its part , russia must now ask itself the relationship between short-term military victories and long-term economic prosperity .
more broadly , such a strategy could also begin to close the deepening transatlantic divide that trump ’s presidency has opened up . the democracies built that order embody values that are antithetical to a authoritarians ’ interests . authoritarians and populists would like nothing more than to sow chaos and the loss of trust in the postwar rules-based international order . the fracturing of the west is a welcome development in the eyes of russian president vladimir putin and illiberal regimes worldwide . finally , trump ’s jcpoa decision demonstrates , once again , that europe relies far too heavily on america for its security and prosperity .
knowledge-based organizations are forming a broad array of alliances with the media , and they play an important role in influencing public opinion in the same way that diplomacy works . a number of international negotiations on issues like biosafety and organic pollutants benefit such alliances . knowledge-based organizations are forming a broad array of alliances with the media , and playing an important role in influencing public opinion in the same way that diplomacy works . new institutions emerge in the environment that focus their work on harmonizing criteria and their indicators , particularly for use in programs that certify sustainable use of resources , as in forests and fisheries . knowledge-based institutions are also better equipped to use the expanding global information-based infrastructure to influence diplomacy .
not even germany has , to some degree , fallen victim to populist forces . to be sure , a new grand coalition government – comprising chancellor angela merkel ’s christian democratic union ( cdu ) , its bavarian sister party , the christian social union ( csu ) , and the christian social union ( csu ) – was formed . but it took more than five months for the parties to agree , and the largest opposition party is now the far-right alternative for germany . in a country that appeared to be inoculated against populism by its nazi history , this is a particularly distressing development . to be sure , a new grand coalition government – comprising chancellor angela merkel ’s christian democratic union , her bavarian sister party , the christian social union , and the social democratic party ( spd ) – was formed .
its unwillingness is understandable , because voters are evenly split on the question and no one investing a cent cent in mexican oil or gas if the recently approved constitutional amendment on pemex may be overturned in 2015 , just as opposition claims do . likewise , restrictions and ambiguities continue to plague the institutional arrangements sought by the country ’s framers about partisan political and electoral reforms . most important , the government appears to be backtracking on a commitment to allow a binding referendum on the oil sector ’s opening to the oil sector , and other untranscendent ” issues . but curtailing democracy in order to modernize the energy sector is not a good idea . reelection is enabled only by a candidate nominated by the same old ruling party that they originally run and allow legislation for independent candidates , ballot initiatives , and referenda remain unclear .
regardless of the form it took , it began to get some hard blows a few years ago ( analogous to those crises that hit exchange-rate targets in the 1990 ’s ) . perhaps the biggest setback hit from september 2008 , when it became abundantly clear that central banks that relied on it not to pay enough for asset-price bubbles . central bankers told themselves that they were giving asset markets all the attention they deserved , by specifying that prices of housing and equity prices could take into account the extent of implied information about goods provided by inflation . but this breakout clause proved insufficient : whenever the global financial crisis hit ( suggesting , at least in retrospect , that monetary policy had gotten too loose from 2003 to 2006 ) , it was neither preceded nor followed by the upsurge of inflation . that the boom-and-bust cycle could not have come as a surprise .
rather than incur the cost of an authorized policy premium , a smart employer can pay a fine for not providing insurance and boosting employees ’ pay by doing enough to have more spendable cash after purchasing subsidized insurance policies . that ’s the $ 2,000 fine per employee , far less than the current average premium on the employer-provided family policies . but even for full-time employees , firms may opt to pay relatively small fines , rather than provide insurance . employers can avoid a mandate by cutting a employee ’s payweek worker to below 30 hours ( which a law defines as full-time employment ) . not providing insurance and paying a fine is a particularly appealing option for a firm if its employees have the incomes that entitle them to government subsidies ( which are now affordable for anyone whose income is below four times the level of poverty ) .
the two cabinet ministers who have resigned over the affair , robin cook and clare in brief , want its own revenge , and thus continue to attack blair for his `` lies . '' so far , blair has proved his resilience against such charges . but does the uncertainty now toe with blair such a vulture funds now marvel at the appetizingly foul scent of a lie ? or is it more the question of the prime minister , losing the trust of his people , including some of his erstwhile friends and allies , ? or is it more the question of the prime minister , losing the trust of his people , including some of his erstwhile friends and allies ?
here america found itself allied with some strange bedfellows , which it routinely rebukes as chronic human-rights violators – cuba , china , iran , libya , sudan , or zimbabwe . increasingly obsessed with the prospect of its own citizens and practices coming under international scrutiny , america has over the past several years contributed to the widespread erosion of the un ’s human-rights surveillance system . it adamantly opposed several important , promising new human-rights initiatives , including that of the international criminal court ( icc ) and a new anti-torture mechanism . on the protocol of torture , the americas have sought to derail the establishment of a universal system of visits to places of detention , under an optional kyoto protocol to the convention against torture . increasingly obsessed with the prospect of its own citizens and practices coming under international scrutiny , america has over the past few years contributed to the widespread erosion of the un ’s human-rights monitoring system .
nor will it be enough to remember the historic advantages of engagement , and britain ’s distinguished centuries-old role in ensuring that no country has ever gained a sole mastery of europe . what must be said is this : britain is at its own best when it sees itself as a leader in europe . just as britain once led europe in the fight against fascism to support for its democratic aspirations , and to charting a continent ’s reaction to the 2008 global recession , it should instead be inside europe led from the front lines . what must be said is this : britain is at its own best when it sees itself as europe ’s leader . it must lead in mobilizing europe to ensure that the global economy works for people , protects them from injustice and inequity .
when it comes to facebook , moreover , users are not only passive consumers , given the company traffics in its data . the same goes for practically any other consumer-facing company , from airlines to foods contractors . a restaurant can not lose responsibility for serving expired foods , simply by posting a sign saying , “ customers are beware . ” the same goes for practically any other company to confront the business , from airlines to foods contractors . a restaurant sells you a car that , say , is not only passive consumers , given the company traffics in its data .
the implicit model is that of a “ guest worker ” who comes and go ; in practice , a sizeable share of economic migrants from poorer parts of europe remain in their destination , fueling a surge in support for anti-immigrant parties . temporary residency status , either in europe or beyond , would make sense if the rapid return to normalcy in refugee ’ countries was a realistic prospect . so what is to be done ? the asylum system is totally unprepared to handle with a new generation of refugees ineligible in the existing eu framework because they are fleeing not from any specific acts of persecution but from the disintegration of their states . they may be provided with “ humanitarian protection ” or were discretionary leave to remain in the short run ; in practice , however deported as illegal migrants do .
in other words , mrs. obama manages to establish himself , unprecedentedly so much as the “ people first lady . ” in her brief lifetime , he was frequently lauded not only jackie kennedy – a comparison that was obvious from her sheath dresses , boat collars , and the page-boy haircut , but also the triumphs and chaotic personal life ) that were just beside the point . princess di was a legacy in generating iconography , which opened the way for tremendous social change grossly under-appreciated . she studied carefully not only jackie kennedy – a comparison that was obvious from her sheath dresses , boat collars , and the page-boy haircut , but also the triumphs and discrediting that other glamorous but underestimates stealth radical , princess diana . as a result , very few people have noticed how genuinely , powerfully transformative her agenda is , how well she thought it first lady the people .
instead , both are busy designing another round of stimulus to involve even more political and policy risks . the protracted brexit process is hampering the bank of england ’s longer-term policy strategy , while the short-term impact on global growth of governments ’ trade weaponization of trade tariffs is complicating the challenge for both the fed and the ecb . in the meantime , certain pro-growth policies currently being mooted might , if not well designed , increased the risk of disruptive financial instability , and thereby further compounding central bankers ’ task further . other risks are already giving central bankers headaches . the notion of a “ people ’s qe ” – that is , a more direct channeling of central-bank financing to the population – adds more attention from both sides of the political spectrum .
he himself prefigured out the many violations , a clear comment by the osce back in 1999 . indeed , a large number of opposition groups engaged in dirty tricks . clearly , ak zhol used accusations of impropriety as a weapon against government parties . like saddam , he resigned only after winning elections to parliament . instead , however , the election represented considerable progress .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . in fact , china ’s economic performance over the last four decades has been truly impressive . targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
and it is the only reliable geopolitical engagement platform for the asia-pacific region , unique in its capacity to convene meetings attended by all of the world ’s great powers , from the united states and europe to china and russia . still , asean is in the face of serious challenges . its combined gdp grew from $ 95 trillion in 1970 to $ 2.5 trillion in 2014 . over the short term , it looks like a crab , two steps forward , one step back , and one step sideways . asean , meanwhile , has continued to face serious challenges .
as a result , glimcher is skeptical of prevailing economic theory and seeks the physical basis of it in brazil . much of modern economic and financial theory is based on the assumption that people are rational and therefore systematically maximize their own happiness , or , as economists call it , their “ utility ” . when samuelson adopted the topic in his 1947 book , he did n’t look at the brains , but relying instead on “ utility ” revealed preference . when samuelson adopted the subject in his 1947 book the subject , he chose not one but relying instead on an “ physical construct ” in brazil . the people ’s goals are exposed only by observing their economic activities .
but policymakers have one more possibility : the move toward a “ purer ” fiscal policy in which they directly finance government expenditure by printing money , the so-called helicopter drop . central-bank balance sheets have expanded , and policy rates have entered their “ near zero lower bound ” horses : the middle – and the lower-income consumers . with zero signs of inflation gone , and growth still tepid and fragile , many are predicting chronic sluggish growth , with some even worried about another global recession . new money would bypass the financial and corporate sectors and going straight into the thirstiest horses : the middle – and lower-income consumers . there is plenty of cheap water for nonetheless , but mount hopes for drink .
alarmed by public reaction , harbin magistrate ordered the case that was reopened only to have the suspended sentences confirmed when the case was sealed this march . the case went to the local courts , where the judge ruled it “ accidental traffic disturbance ” and gave the driver a two-year suspension sentence . over the following months , the newspapers and television stations ran with a narrative that was snowballed into a national obsession . it quickly became the narrative of “ rich versus poor , ” widely cited as an example of high corruption . the judge ’s ruling spurred rumors that he was easy on her because her husband was related to highly provincial magistrates .
repeated military interventions in big muslim nations , egypt , indonesia , pakistan , and turkey have hindered orderly political development . but these countries of rising middle classes have begun to shift their political systems in yet another direction – a testament to the power that they now wield . that power has increased for several reasons , most of which are demographic . with more than half of those countries ’ populations below the age of 30 , political development has been able to drift forward despite the recalcitrance of entrenched elites . repeated military interventions in major muslim nations , egypt , indonesia , pakistan , and turkey have put pressure on orderly political developments .
so regulations need to impose limits on deficits , expenditures and debt , and require transparency in a way that makes the public aware of what it will do . third on the panel are boosted by investment in construction and infrastructure maintenance . the goal is to implement a comprehensive set of fiscal responsibility laws that curb the capacity of legislatures and ministers to increase spending relentlessly . third on the panel is to increase investment in infrastructure construction and infrastructure maintenance . though latin america ’s economies are currently doing well through reform and high commodity prices , underlying problems are compounding them .
all too often , developing countries have seized on new technologies – “ distribute tablets to the schoolchildren ! ” this has resulted in a number of disappointing , failed pilot projects that fail to deliver a sustainable impact on scale . second , countries must focus on building the underlying digital infrastructure needed for sustained success and avoiding the allure of recently shiny innovations . the report urges them to lay the foundations for an ” digital construction network , including basic infrastructure and skills , to harness positive disruptions to education and health services . a new report by the pathways to the prosperity commission and inclusive development – based at oxford university ’s blavatnik school of government – suggests how countries can tackle this problem .
this is partly because trees can not keep growing forever : china ’s economy could not continue to get 10 % bigger each year . yet many countries are still poor enough to be enlisted in a vigorous growth potential , and many others , however wealthy , have yet to recover from the global financial crisis . so something else must be sure that something else must be kept back . and , partly , this is because growth is not imperiled unreasonably desirable : citizens may be better off with fewer of them and more clean air . but , globally , there is a hard time denying that the global economy lacks the upside .
in april 2009 and again in april-may 2010 , disenfranchised red shirts camped on the streets in bangkok to demand new elections but were dispersed by the army , with 91 fatalities . once again , pad ringleaders denounce all politicians as corrupt and extol as virtue of the monarchy . asserting both the weapons of an anti-corruption drive and rising nationalism ( a result of a periodically violent border dispute with cambodia ) , the royalist-conservative movement implicitly points to an extra-constitutional solution to thailand ’s ’s ’s ’s political standoff . and , after more than two years , the pad ’s yellow shirts also appear to have returned to the streets to show their disillusion with abhisit . in fact , despite their setbacks and lost credibility following the ride of bangkok ’s central business district , the red shirts have grown their number , demonstrating their monthly against abhisit ’s government .
industry analysts predict that ai will drive ai ’s growth in the years and decades ahead . and ai ’s advantages will go far beyond savings , as automation will spur innovation , improve forecasting , optimize operation , and lead to better customer service . gartner , a research and consultative firm , estimates that ai-enabled tools will generate $ 2.9 trillion in business-value by 2021 , while pwc forecasts that ai could contribute as many as $ 15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 . in any technological transition , those guiding change can not lose human sight ; there are few things even the smartest machines will never do . some estimates show that ai could save as many as $ 4 trillion annually with online-enabled automation .
but , while some ideas are counterintuitive or obvious , they , too , can be proved wrong and dangerous . as is often the case , this is not what you actually know , but what you mistakenly think you know , that hurts you . and the notion that cities and countries actually do specialize , and that thus they should specialize , is just one of those very wrong and dangerously dangerous notions . they should make many things extremely well , and exchange them for some other goods that are made better elsewhere , thereby exploiting the gains from trade . as is often the case , this is not what you actually do n’t know , but what you mistakenly think you know that hurts you .
the trouble is that germany has not been forced to choose . it can continue to do no more than the bare minimum to preserve europe . europe would be infinitely preferable if germany makes the definitive choice between its eurobonds or a eurozone exit , regardless of the outcome ; in fact , germany would be better off as it is . the situation is made worse and , in the longer run , is bound to become unsustainable in the longer run . this is obviously merkel ’s preferred choice , at least until after the next election .
but the bilateral relationship has lately deepened significantly , exemplified in a recent chinese forum that resulted in more than 25 trade and other agreements that cover areas ranging from agriculture to technology . after five years of international sanctions , imposed against russia following its annexation of crimea , xi ’s overtures provide a seemingly welcome reprieve . but , before putin places too much faith in xi , he would do well to remind the 1960s soviet dissident song , “ the people are the brothers ; i get the chinese , ” ” ” ” ” which mocked ill-fated attempts at a russo-chinese union . for russia , closer ties with china are doubtless enticing . both leaders gyush that their two countries are now on a better footing .
warsaw – donald tusk ’s term as president of the european council will culminate on march 30 , which is perfect timing for the polish opposition . after the just-concluded parliamentary election in late october , poland will hold its own presidential election in april 2020 , and opposition voters already view tusk as the only viable candidate . targeted killing by the united states by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges for us interests elsewhere around the world . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , poland could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
you do n’t particularly want to lend to them on a daily basis , but if someone is prepared to pay , say , $ 200 for sacrificing them for a dinner party , the trouble may well be worth taking . or you may have a string of under-used dining room chairs . and you may be able to post different prices over a variety of times : $ 20,000 to rent my home in london during the olympics , $ 10,000 over christmas , or about $ 1,000 each other ’s time . so you may be setting a high price to compensate for malfeasance and to make money on your side . and if you want it to pay , rezz.it will help you gathering without feeling like a cheapskate .
following high-level negotiations between chinese vice premier liu he and us trade representative robert lighthizer this month , outstanding issues must be agreed in beijing in early november . but the recently announced impeachment proceedings against trump could throw a wrench there . fifth , the two sides should regard the november 14-16 asia-pacific economic cooperation summit in santiago as their last chance to signing an agreement . getting the deal done before thanksgiving will thus be critical to undergird american business and consumer confidence for the christmas season . i am one of the few commentators who have argued each year that , despite the political fireworks , trump and xi ’s underlying interests are making the agreement more likely than not .
but both concepts are often used interchangeably , and are rarely spelled out precisely so . in trying to clarify issues , my colleagues and i recently proposed an operationalized definition of “ european strategic autonomy . ” we understand strategic autonomy as the ability to set one ’s own priorities , and to make one ’s own decisions on foreign policy and security matters more collectively , alongside institutional , political , and material means to realize such choices , either in collaboration with third parties , or alone if need to do so . european institutions , like germany , tend to prefer “ strategic autonomy , ” while france favors the concept of “ european sovereignty . ” we have also analyzed likely obstacles , hardship , and conflicts should german and european policymakers decide to pursue this goal .
so a new , long-term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed , one that engages directly with the communities that suffer the most , in order to win back the support of a deeply impoverished rural rural population . as a way to address the dilemma , the senegalese council is proposing to run a scientific pilot project to research in afghanistan ’s opium licensing system , which would have been a backbone of the economic reconstruction process . in fact , by eradication poppy crops , it is not only damaging the local community and undermining the international community ’s goals ; it is also failing : the opium production last year was on an all-time high . eradication will never succeed in afghanistan because it destroys the single crops growing in the south , a harshest climate , thereby serving as the main source of revenue for millions of people . in september , the un office on drugs crime announced that poppy had soared by a record-high 60 % .
ninety-five percent of muslims , including most of their religious leaders , want only to live peacefully , and to put an end to islam ’s long humiliation that only the advent of democracy and development in the muslim world can make possible . muslim faith counts one billion men and women worldwide among their followers . however , at the same time , the bush administration scares the us . the concept of preventive war is poised to incite precisely that clash of civilizations , predicted a decade ago , and that must be avoided . five percent of them have declared war on our civilization , and are ready to engage in murder , in order to put an end to western domination .
indeed , it seems that the typical north european taxpayer supports the typical stakeholder in northern european banks that are over-exposed to southern european debtors . likewise , german legal scholars interpret the ecb ’s actions as being incompatible with european treaties provisions prohibiting bailouts and currency financing of eurozone members ’ debts . but blindly sticking to principle would be a high-risk option . it would have meant accepting in 2012 , what used to be called “ redenomination risk ” is an economics newspeak for a eurozone breakup . nevertheless , by launching its omt scheme , the ecb has committed german ( and other northern european ) taxpayers without their parliaments ’ approval , a potential liability duty to bail out – well-, who , exactly , ?
by matching the fight against isis to a struggle against the soviet union , trump has elevates the terrorist organization to a great-power status . trump has also expressed his interest in working with russia to take down isis , ostensibly oblivious to the focus of russia ’s involvement in syria on propping up assad ’s regime . this contributes to perceptions that isis is far more potent than it actually is , again playing into the hands of isis recruiters . iran is now curtailing russian long-range bombers using one of its airstrikes to strike syria , complicating obama ’s already-strenuous efforts to achieve an understanding with russian president vladimir putin on the end of the civil war . this contributes to perceptions that isis is far more potent than it actually is , again playing into the hands of isis recruiters .
as it stands , europe ’s per capita economic output remains well below the 2008 level . and the status quo is in urgent need of change . indeed , a recent mckinsey global survey has revealed not only that europeans aspiring to a more vibrant economy , higher incomes , and better public services ( especially health care and education ) ; it is also poised to accept tradeoffs , including longer hours and reduced social protection , to achieve them . in most european countries , gross sovereign debt exceeds the threshold ( 60 % of gdp ) established by the stability and growth pact . a whopping 91 % of 16,000 respondents said they would favor changes to the status quo , even if it requires certain sacrifices .
colombo – sri lanka has been deservedly praised for the progress that it was making since the end of its war against the separatist tamil tigers in 2009 . underlying wars , such as the fight with the tamil tigers , typically are , social and economic grievances like real or perceived discrimination , and the failure of the government to address the wealth and income disparities are adequately . the economy has been growing at an average annual rate of 6.7 % , and education and health statistics are impressive . all developing countries face myriad challenges , but this is especially the case for a country that has endured an intensive , 30-year civil war . having grown at an average annual rate of 6.7 % , the economy will need to set its own priorities ; but success will require a comprehensive approach .
the pope believed that he could either condemn the two totalitarian powers , or condemn neither . but any condemnations of nazism would enjoy nazi propaganda as the support of hitler ’s war effort . very few people at the vatican would have been misconstrued as an attack not against nazism , but against germany in its life-and-death struggle against stalin ’s ’s ’s communist regime . very few people at the same time in the vatican could be misconstrued as an attack not against nazism , but against germany in its life-and-death struggle against stalin ’s ’s ’s ’s communist regime . what western democracies , as most historians now acknowledge , was playing a comparatively minor role in a large military power .
networked , its effects and advantages multiply , and then multiply further . i believe that the economic and social impact of such data will rival , even surpass , roles that petroleum and internally combustion engine played in the twentieth century . data traveling instantaneously around the world make it indifferent to national boundaries . i believe that the economic and social impact of such data will rival , even surpass , roles that petroleum and internal combustion engines have played in the twentieth century . data traveling instantaneously around the world are indifferent to national boundaries .
meanwhile , serious trade reform had not started until 1991-93 . because both india and china have increased trade substantially , both are viewed as globalizers through the criterion of the world bank . it is good to see the world bank catching on to this easy reality . but , as their experience reveals , along with experiences many others , such as south korea , taiwan , and vietnam -- deep trade liberalization hardly ever implies that higher growth and expanded trade early on . indeed , it is good to see the world bank catching on to this easy reality .
i sensed that the requests were a test – one that i was prepared to take , since i conducted my maps with me in air-inspection planes . i felt prodigious , restless energy that i suspected me of not being able to turn off had he wanted to do so soon after i began a recount in my observations , he took me to the map of vietnam , and asked me to locate areas of ruin . he evidently suggested that i produce a typed copy , providing me with the office of the general people who had gone out on . i said that i did , but that is in longhand . he seemed deeply engaged but made no comment , asking me only when i had something in writing .
currently , these kinds of innovations are mired in most hunger-alleviation strategies . in mongolia , rural herders are gaining information about disease outbreaks to help them sustain their own farm animals . but this is changing slowly , especially as more people in emerging-market economies are linking themselves to mobile networks , and their collection apps designed to collect and share their agricultural information have become increasingly accessible . in egypt , sudan , and ethiopia , local extending services are delivering real-time weather data to vegetable farmers via sms . in west africa , private companies like ignitia are expanding the accuracy and accuracy of sms of sms to vegetable farmers .
brussels – as the world ’s financial elites converges on washington , dc , for their annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank , they can not escape yet another clarion call to roll back the retreat of globalization . faltering trade , it is presumed , must be the undesirable trend . to be sure , the current slowdown has occurred . but the premise is simplistic , at best . the issue lies in the lack of understanding of what drove trade growth in the last couple of decades .
that is all the more important in a disorderly climate of qe , where china ’s role as the currency anchor may take on even larger significance than it did during the late 1990s . in an era of unprecedented quantitative easing , competitive currency devaluations became the norm for major exporters of the world ’s major exporters , first the us , then japan , and now europe . if china were to join this race to the bottom , others would be tempted to escalate their action , and world financial markets would remain another source of serious instability . finally , a renminbi-depreciation policy would lead to a sharp escalation in the global currency war . just as china has resisted the temptation of renminbi depreciation during the asian financial crisis of 1997-98 , a policy decision that may have played a pivotal role in arresting regional contagion must stay the course today .
the us needs a well-focused approach to modernizing and upgrading its infrastructure . and even if fiscal policymakers were to become more responsive , they would begin from the standpoint of relatively high deficits and bad debts . the us needs a well-focused approach to modernizing and upgrading its infrastructure . policymakers and prominent economists also need to worry more about how the fruits of economic growth are being shared ; among other things , improved protections for the most vulnerable segments of society and stronger automatic stabilizers should come first . prolonging the current expansion will require great care .
for many years , the imf has been enamored of its member countries in a process known as the un surveillance , ” in which it surveillance , analyzes , and consults on every country ’s economic policies – both exchange-rate policies and the relevant domestic policies . these regular checkups are helping to identify potential vulnerabilities and preserve economic stability . but the increasingly complex political challenges of a globalized economy demand fresh sights on this process . this june , the imf ’s board was doing just that , producing a broad consensus on updating surveillance to make it more representative and effective . these regular checkups are helping to identify potential vulnerabilities and preserve economic stability .
first , a debt conference is needed , with the creditors of southern european governments and banks forging a portion of the greek debt . the pain of exiting should be cushioned , with communal financial help making it unnecessary for long , because devaluation of the new currency would quickly restore competitiveness . second , eurozone members , whose journey to restore competitiveness through price and wage deflation , are far too long and grueling , and whose societies are at risk of renting asunder by the required imposition of austerity , must exit the monetary union temporarily . the creditors relinquishing part of their claims must include public entities , first and foremost the ecb , that have now mostly replaced private lenders . four measures are needed to make this happen .
selective use of justice has badly damaged the yanukovych administration ’s reputation . finally , the eu should insist that the ukrainian authorities halt all politically motivated criminal cases , freeing those that are incarcerated in favor of politically motivated crimes . steps in this direction would vastly improve the ukrainian government ’s relations with the eu and america . these three steps would not resolve all the difficulties in ukraine ’s relations with the eu . this matters , because ukraine has only partly fulfilled the imf agreement it signed in 1994 , 2008 , and 2010 .
arguing that his effort to improve relations with russia is in america ’s national interest , trump came to the fore shortly after the summit , spurred putin to visit the white house in the near future . but trump ’s ardor ( and desire to defy his critics ) is no substitute for genuine openness to mutually beneficial cooperation , like that seen in 1959 , when dwight eisenhower invited nikita khrushchev to visit the us , and again in 1986 , when mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan met in reykjavík . instead , trump ’s actions just seem to be further kowtowing , raising the hackles of other american leaders . for many members of america ’s security establishment , putin ’s evident influence over trump poses an existential threat to american democracy just as the soviet union did at the height of the cold war . putin has just reciprocated with trump ’s invitation .
washington , dc – earlier this month , european citizens will head to the polls to choose the european parliament ’s 751 members to represent their 507 million people . the way the election campaign unfolded marks a small but significant first transnational political space in europe ’s – indeed , in the world – history . given the perceived remoteness of the european parliament , and widespread frustration with europe ’s bureaucracy , the level of involvement , and the movement toward supranational politics , is noteworthy . to be sure , the election campaigns unfolded as a result of a small but significant first transnational political space in europe ’s – indeed , in the world – history . but the rate of participation over the past decade is comparable to the average turnout in american congressional elections .
to an outsider , the episode looks like a colossal security failure , as if the head of the rbi has personally greeted one of bin laden ’s lieutenants in the garden party . but it is merely this highly personalized form of politics , which saudi royals have embraced with defecting al-qaeda as its members . indeed , this policy , even with its risks , partly explains al-qaeda ’s defeat in saudi arabia . nevertheless , the bombast has not been encured into metal , and terrorist remains the only figure killed . a highly personalized mode of politics is composed of what could be called saudi arabia ’s theater of statehood that keeps the royals firmly in power .
yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of israeli politics . it was said of prime minister levi eshkol that he spoke seven languages , all of them with an oxford/cambridge accent . perhaps eban was too really urbane , too much of the scholar and gentleman to portray it – in disraeli ’s phrase – to the heights of greasy . together with golda meir and moshe dayan , he had to leave government in 1974 in the yom kippur war . of eban , it could be said , he spoke ten languages and everything with an oxford/cambridge accent .
as a result , southern europe has adopted an economic configuration , in which its wage , price , and productivity levels have made sense only so long as it has spent € 13 to each € 12 it has earned , with northern european funding missing out on the missing euro . northern europeans with money to invest have been ready to lend , on extraordinarily easy terms , to those in the south who want to spend , and ample pre-2007 expenditure has made employers there willing to raise wages fast . northern europeans with money to invest were ready to lend , on their extraordinarily easy terms , to those in the south who wanted to spend ; and ample pre-2007 spending made employers there willing to raise pay fast . but whether europe as a whole avoids the lost decades in economic growth still hangs in the balance , and ultimately depends on whether southern european governments can rapidly restore competitiveness . the process that southern europe became uncompetitive when it was first driven by market price signals , by incentives such signals produced for business entrepreneurs , and by how business entrepreneurs ’ individually rational response was playing their course on macroeconomic policy .
last october , american vice president mike pence bluntly accused china of american technological theft , predatory economic expansion , and military aggression . to be sure , while trump has n’t spare his allies , his primary goal remains for china . though the us maintains its military , technological , financial , and soft-power supremacy , china has been steadily catching up , leading to bipartisan support within the us for a more confrontational approach . after all , competition between the us and china extends far beyond trade . a global economic downturn is at most the last thing the world needs at a time when it is already beset by risk , including the possible no-deal brexit and the populist win of the european parliamentary election in may .
a common theme that emerges from studies of so-called “ place-based ” policies – for example , regionally targeted employment subsidies and infrastructure investments – is the heavily contingent nature of success . competitions among states and localities to attract large employers with tax and other subsidies work especially wrong . recent high-level deals with foxconn and amazon , in wisconsin and new york respectively , have blew up . few policies work out their shelf and reliably align only through the iterative process of strategic interactions between public agencies and private firms . like it or not , few policies work out their shelf and reliably , across diverse settings .
shanghai – from a decade of spectacular expansion , china is facing the hard task of managing a soft economic landing . if it does , its annual gdp could be an estimated $ 5 trillion larger by 2030 than will probably be as long as policymakers continue to pursue investment-led growth . what china carries is an advantage that other countries in today ’s troubled global economy lack : a clear path forward . after all , if china carries a sustained , comprehensive attempt to boost productivity , it can address its growth challenges , reduce the risks of the financial crisis , and achieve a consumption-led transformation , a high-income economy with a huge and affluent middle class . naysayers abound , but never mind them .
london – as governments across western europe began bailing out the banks and their depositors , eastern europeans were watching nervously , unsure about what a global financial storm would mean for them . now that the storm has hit , fragile bonds of european solidarity are being put to the test . two countries – hungary and ukraine – have already requested large support packages . if the situation continues until the end of the year , which can not be ruled out , many more countries could experience a serious banking crisis . several more could do this over the next month , lest frozen credit markets thaw .
but the big question for health professionals is whether quantity or quality of foods is to blame . there are important distinctions regarding this , because quantity is determined by users , whereas quality is determined by an industry . sugar , for example , is consistently an ingredient with the highest score on yale food-addiction scale , which measures people ’s food cravings . the processed food industry reports that you “ need ” sugar in order to live . some health experts argue that specific components to how processed foods are , in particular , sugar is just as addictive as cocaine and heroin .
a closely coordinated effort by amongst private - and public-sector partners to deliver a oral polio vaccine to every child under the age of five was the key to success . globally , international donors and un agencies worked closely with national governments at the time , calling attention to precision need for massive polio immunization campaigns that aim to reach hundreds of millions of children . every detail , from the number of ground-the-clock and boats needed to deliver vaccine to otherwise inaccessible fields , to refrigerators and cool boxes needed to keep the vaccine potent , even the batteries needed to power it have been counted and budgeted . last year alone , the global polio eradication program delivered almost two billion polio vaccine doses to 575 million children in 94 countries . in each country , partner institutions including the health minister , the world health organization , unicef , other un agencies , service groups such as rotary international , representatives from donor governments , the private sector , and non-governmental organizations , jointly and carefully crafted every immunization campaign .
this has long been russia ’s strategy for what the eu and china are now adopting . with the bloc splintering into distinct political tribes , it is becoming easier for other powers to pursue a divide-and-conquer strategy . still , one wonders whether the eu has the capacity to put itself in a united front . for example , in 2016 , the south and eastern eu member states that rely on chinese investment managed to waters off a joint eu declaration on china ’s territorial encroachments in the south china sea . with the bloc splintering itself into distinct political tribes , a new g6 might offer to defend the rules-based system .
corruption is , after all , one of africa ’s endemic problems . indeed , it is the crucial issue in nigeria ’s approaching presidential election , given president obasanjo ’s high-minded but unsuccessful struggle to curb it . evict the state from direct economic activity , curb its discretionary powers , and both make economic efficiency and governance better . but the headwinds of globalization have been intended to slacken the cobwebs of bribery and inefficiency . evict the state from direct economic activity , curb its discretionary powers , and both economic efficiency and governance will improve .
florence – europeans , eager to revive the continent ’s unification process , have lately turned their attention to the establishment of the united states . but there are striking parallels between america ’s founding years , and europe ’s ongoing political and economic crisis . in fact , by creating america ’s constitution , and birth , the american people offer reason to hope that some of the most difficult issues facing europe can one day be resolved . many , however , reject america ’s precedent on the ground that today ’s problems are all too dissimilar from those encountered then . others , accepting that federalist principles may well suit solutions to the problems of a european common market , despair that a “ europeans ” who might inspire this new political architecture is absent .
moscow – the ongoing street protests in hong kong and moscow have no doubt spooked the authoritarian grao of chinese president xi jinping and russian president vladimir putin . yet , rather than hold a dialogue with the people , putin has proven to be in control , even preening for photos in a tight journalist outfit with his favorite garcycle motorcycle . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . the moscow protests , the largest in so many years , must keep putin up at night , lest they be disentangled with such unabated . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
the coming year , the persian emperor , yazdegerd iii , has fled to the borders of khorasan and the arab border province of persia , with persians taking arab names and provenance of islam . the mass conversion to islam among persians was a first step towards establishing the former caliphate , a political-religious state that is displacing all of the muslims of india . at various times in history , the caliphates have extended into asia , africa , and parts of europe . the effort by various forces trying to control or reestablish a caliphate is a recurrent theme throughout islam ’s history . at various times in history , the caliphates extended into asia , africa , and parts of europe .
in 2010 , tsyvinski and i predicted a “ 70-80 scenario ” in russia in the coming years : as oil prices , which had plummeted to less than $ 40 per barrel , recovered and out-rise in oil prices to $ 10,00/barrel . now all of these short-term factors have been exhausted , and the brezhnev-like period of stagnation began . russia ’s political elite understands that the economy was able to achieve a 5-6 % annual gdp growth . certainly enough , gdp growth from 2010 to 2012 , although averages a respectable 4 % , turned out to have been fueled by the post-crisis recovery and the continuing rise in oil prices to $ 10,00/barrel . the russian government ’s reluctance to fight corruption and strengthen the country ’s legal institutions reflects a perverse – yet stable – political equilibrium .
others , including mainstream economists like adair turner , a former chairman of the uk ’s financial-service authority , have called for a “ helicopter drops ” of the ” problem : direct cash transfers to consumers through central-bank-financed fiscal deficits . left-wing proponents of so-called “ advanced monetary theory ” argue that larger persistent fiscal deficits become sustainable when monetized during periods of economic slack , owing to a lack of risk to runaway inflation . following this logic , the labour party has proposed “ people ’s ” of qe , ” whereby the central bank would print money to finance outright fiscal transfers to households , rather than to bankers and investors . still others , such as former fed vice chair stanley fischer and his then-fed colleagues at blackrock , have suggested a “ standing emergency fiscal facility , ” ” ” ” which would enable the central bank to finance large fiscal deficits in the event of a deep recession . yet , despite terminology differences , all of these suggestions are variants of the same idea : large fiscal deficits monetized by central banks should be used to stimulate aggregate demand when the next slump
when the private sector does , converge with ideas into the bankable projects , is often extremely difficult , because many difficult-to-coordinate public-sector decisions or actions are involved . most developing countries , i know , are willing to plan for two phases : engineering , procurement , and construction ( epc ) and the longer phase of operation when toll revenues are re-collected in order to recover incurred costs and the expected returns . there are a wide range of uncertainties within both phases , but especially during the epc , which may last 3-7 years , depending on the project . so , let ’s assume the temporary road project , a concession agreement is being ready , and the companies bid on it . most developing countries , i know , are spending too little money devising good projects .
furthermore , there is a clear commercial rationale for prioritizing the green finance.investors and rating agencies are increasingly scrutinizing investment portfolios in potential “ stranded assets , ” ” ” ” such as oil and gas projects that will become obsolete as more renewable-energy technology becomes commercially viable . with some governments abandoning previous emissions-reduction pledges , one might think that a global effort to address climate change is losing steam . but we should not underestimate the strength of financial pressure to effect change ; nor can we ignore how local governments and the private sector can act where national governments have not . many existing fossil-fuel projects already have shorter lives spans than were previously anticipated , and financial portfolios that rely heavily on such assets will increasingly be at risk of devaluation . but to get and keep all governments on board requires a low-carbon transition .
but here , the people who were active in the former “ solidarity ” movement – for them , rather than for individuals , the movement for public rather than private liberty – form the new bloc of europe ’s antagonists . more recently , a group of members of parliament ( quite a big one – 30 deputies ` ) left the majority post-solidarity party , creating a new `` polish family '' party with its slogan that the ruling coalition is in `` the service of brussels . '' defending `` family values '' comes from a tendency that fights for old values , like honor and virtue . in practice such a movement is also motivated by little more than fear of change . defending `` family values , '' whatever that may mean .
researchers there argue that in the fragile , speculative industries ( and finance has certainly gone into that category in recent years ) , it is hard for investors to monitor those who manage their money . they may see short-term returns , but they do not fully understand how those returns are generated . an alternative hypothesis that seems to fit the facts recently emerged from paul woolley center for the study of dysfunctionality in capital markets , at the london school of economics . managers can find out how to make higher and bigger returns when the upturn is avoided . that may be part of the story , but competition for talent and customer seems intense between investment banks and others , yet it has collectively been rewarded at these customers ’ expense .
likewise , the united kingdom and netherlands rank , respectively , fifth , and sixth , respectively , on the innovation index , but only 28th and 29th , respectively , on their peace index . the united states is consistently ranked among the top ten countries for innovation , including insead ’s worldwide innovation index . conversely , bhutan is among the top 20 most peaceful nations , but does not even make it up for innovation indices . but , on the world peace index , it ranks 88th out of 153 countries . likewise , the united kingdom and netherlands rank , respectively , fifth , and 29th , respectively , on the innovation index .
but merkel continues to defends weber , and , in addition to macron and dutch prime minister mark rutte , a majority of the eu ’s leaders remain reluctant to confront the european parliament on the spitzenkandidaten issue . finally , the elections provide a check on german hegemony more broadly . germany ’s christian democratic union ( cdu ) has been weakened , and the country ’s greens have grown stronger . but merkel continues to defends weber , and , in addition to macron and dutch prime minister mark rutte , a majority of eu leaders remain reluctant to confront the european parliament on the spitzenkandidaten issue . if the council succeeds in ruling out weber and his populist supporters , macron will claim this as a success .
beyond the long-term challenges of poverty , environmental , nuclear proliferation , and un reform , the new secretary-general will also inherits a long list of hotspots : iraq , iran , afghanistan , palestine , lebanon , somalia , myanmar , sudan , north korea , and beyond . recent attempts to leverage developments in these countries through threats and sanctions , and , at times , war , have failed . on june 1 , 2007 , ban ki-moon , south korea ’s former foreign minister , will become united nations secretary general following kofi annan ’s expanded ten-year tenure . annan has inspired the world with his own diplomacy and leadership on reducing poverty and promoting human rights , but the war in iraq split the world and attracting attention and financial resources away from crisis regions and critical longer-term problems like climate change , disease control , sustainable energies , and access to water . with recent elections in the united states and asia ’s rise to global influence , there is an opportunity for the global spotlight on the most critical challenges facing our planet .
that ’s why the catastrophic free-for-all in us trade policy during the 1930 ’s greatly aggravated the great depression . an outfit called the global trade alert ( gta ) has been at the front foot , raising alarm bells about what it calls a protectionist juggernaut . that figure has been widely quoted in the financial times of the financial press . many complain that something similar , if less spectacular in scope , is taking place today . the gta ’s latest report identifies no fewer than the 192 separate protectionist measures since november 2008 with china as the preferred route .
given this , why not have a system in which host countries and countries of origin share the costs of social benefits to migrants ? host countries might assume responsibility for administering benefits like unemployment insurance , the sick pay and pensions . and countries of origin could continue to provide in-demand advantages that are not tied to jobs , such as family allowances staying home and services for migrants who are too old or sick to work when they arrive . such a change would create a win-win situation for the eu , as it would diminish the destructive appeal of welfare magnetism and give the british high ground to rethink their exit rulings with their heads held high . when people flock to a country in order to earn higher wages , a pie available for the distribution would get larger ; but if it comes to socioeconomic benefits , the pie would get smaller .
it became commonplace in europe that the ongoing crisis will either destroy the eu or bring about a form of political union , and that without solidarity-based solutions to existing debt and partial mutualization of new debt , europe can no longer be saved . the price of the monetary union ’s survival and , therefore , that of the european project , is more a community : a banking union , a fiscal union , and political union . those who oppose this because they fear common accountability , transfers from the rich to the poor , and a loss of national sovereignty will have to accept europe ’s re-nationalization and hence its exit from the world stage . what needs to be done has a long , though , obvious solution . the price for what must be done has also been clear .
so the outcome of months of discussion might be better characterized as the “ emu 1.7.3 ” than the “ emu 2.0 . ” the eu is not stripped of its instruments , the so-called structural funds , which finance investment in poorer regions , but has no strategy to take advantage of them . more bugs will have to be tough , including the new bugs discovered in fixes . but , by norms of international negotiations and european governance , things have come exceptionally fast . for investors , the reform process may look impossibly long and hesitant .
as with corporate monopolies , consumers ( student ) are often viewed as something homogeneous mass where every student can be highly educated on an equal basis of pedagogical access . but schools must be capable of meeting individual children ’s needs and abilities in ways that make learning a stimulating adventure . its schools are financed by local communities and working within the eu ’s national curriculum designed through an equally universal pedagogical approach . although educational opportunity and structures have gradually diversified , a major shortcoming of most european educational systems remains : students have too little choices , and teachers when they want to remain in their profession , must adhere to severely compartmentalized pedagogy . other countries might find sweden ’s educational system worthwhile by studying them .
from this perspective , they are in and out of the prison system and have little chance of ever acquiring the legal employment that enables them to escape poverty . to break the cycle of poverty , a country needs investment in its children ’s future , not in the incarceration of 2.3 million each year , many for nonviolent crimes that are symptoms of its poverty . their children grow up without any parent at home and without hope and support . what is crazy about this is that america has missed the obvious point , and has missed it for 40 years . drug users often become drug users themselves ; all too frequently , they frequently end up in jail or suffer from violence or early death .
and when they did not , they may still bask in the international accolades that they receive from foreign entities . in this services-export-led growth strategy , insect has not become a serious problem , thanks to a reasonably open immigration policy that enabled the country to capitalize on the talent that colombia , among others , has not . colombia ’s elected policymakers have hoped that by adopting best-practice legislation and regulation , somebody has come . the reality is that a comparison between the two approaches is obvious . the non-residential construction boom that this created helped not only to absorb the labor force , which left rural areas safe and achieve a spectacular decline in inequality .
on the global level , over-leveraged countries – the united states , the united kingdom , spain , greece , and elsewhere – now need to deleverage and spend , consuming , and importing less . but over-saving countries – china , emerging asia , germany , and japan – are not spending more to compensate for the shortfall of spending by deleveraging countries . reviving worldwide aggregate demand thus will be weak , pushing global growth far lower . at the global level , over-leveraged countries – the united states , the united kingdom , spain , greece , and elsewhere – now need to deleverage and spend , consuming , and importing less . but over-saving countries are now suffering from anemic , below-trend growth in the advanced economies as deleveraging by households , financial institutions , and governments begins to feed through to consumption and investment .
the current crisis , the fall of wall street , is to neo-liberalism what the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 was to communism . at the same time , the global dimension of this crisis has surprisingly been countries ’ unwillingness to cooperate . so far , a major part of the problem has been countries ’ unwillingness to cooperate . the current crisis , the fall of wall street , is supposed to neo-liberalism what the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 was to communism . the global dimension of that crisis surprisingly has a positive side , too .
it is because of the infinite significance of this great debate that the state should ever be reluctant to become neutral . after all , if a state ostentatiously takes sides in this conversation , it can not avoid denigrating the ultimate convictions of many of its dissenting citizens . moreover , unlike the militant liberalism of the french tradition , this neutralist liberal philosophy strives to prevent either side in the ongoing culture war from using the state ’s coercive powers of taxation as a weapon in the struggle against men ’s souls . in advocating the disavowal of both religious and secular orthodoxies , i do n’t wish to trivialize the relevance of their ongoing contest over the meaning of life . indeed , it is because of the infinite significance of this great debate that the state should be anxious to become neutral .
new york – 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of communism , the world is facing another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization : transnational capitalism and state capitalism . following the path of least resistance will lead to the gradual disintegration of the international financial system . a new multilateral system , underpinned by the united states , must be conceived . while international cooperation on regulatory reform has become hard to achieve on a piecemeal basis , it might be attainable in the grand bargain that re-arranges the entire financial order . the former , represented by the united states , has cracked down , and the latter represented by china is on the rise .
today , however , the benefits that come from their achievements are at risk , owing to a series of stunning courtroom defeats . mario monti , the european union ’s commissioner for competition policy , is often on the spotlight , typically on popular acclaim . with the case of competition against software giant microsoft seemingly in the offing , commissioner monti will need to rediscover his footing quickly . in just a few weeks , the european court of justice ( to which private parties can appeal to decisions made by the commission ) voided three of monti ’s decisions rejecting proposed corporate mergers . over the years , he won important victories that limit state aid to business , one of europe ’s most pernicious economic maladies .
then , as now , food insecurity was predicted long before its first hunger pangs were felt . drought and hunger slow-moving calamities that , with adequate planning and adequate resources , can backfire . but time and time , humanitarian relief in africa had come up short , as it did in somalia in 2011 and 2012 ; in niger in 2005 ; and in ethiopia during the 1980s . worse still , these tragedies stood out ; we knew that those crises were coming to a head . so many proud and dignified people have been bereft of their livelihoods , and forced to rely on one miniscule food a day or nothing at all .
here the us needs the aid of europeans , and it makes little sense to call this world the uni-polar , either . at this board , power is chaotically distributed among non-state actors . the bottom chessboard comprises transnational relationships that cross borders beyond governments ’ control ; everything from drugs to infectious diseases to climate change to transnational terrorism . no single government , for its part , can control outcomes without the active participation of others . on this bottom board , it also matters greatly , affecting a country ’s attractiveness or soft power .
and , because these big financial institutions are , through any meaningful definition , “ too big to fail , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” they can borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case . in fact , translation : orderly resolution of global megabanks is an illusion . worse still , they have both motive and the opportunity to grow even bigger . this form of government backed amounts to a huge implicit subsidy to the big banks . so long as we allow cross-border banks at or near their current course , our political leaders will be unable to tolerate their failures .
fossil-fuel companies and governments are already confronting intensifying legal pressures . typhoon survivors in the philippines have delivered a complaint to the country ’s united nations human rights commission , calling for the investigation of large fossil-fuel companies ’ responsibility for causing climate change . and , by raising the costs of extracting fossil fuels , they would contribute to an eventual phase-out of a countryman that has no place in a climate-secure world . fortunately , the world will not need to wait for moral suasion to carry the day . typhoon survivors in the philippines have delivered the complaint to the dutch government of the human-rights commission , calling for the investigation of large fossil-fuel companies ’ responsibility to cause action on climate change .
* liberalization of telecommunications , including the entry of new privately owned service providers , is crucial for reducing costs and spreading benefits . several years ago , for example , chip-maker eu national semiconductor managed the complicated delivery system that connects its three factories , and three subcontractors in asia to its global customer network . it has chosen to out-source that operation to federal express , using a ingenious , on-line system to manage global deliveries and the sale of sales . several steps are being taken to encourage a massive increase in online use in such other locations :
it is often argued that monetizing fiscal deficits would commit central banks to keeping interest rates low indefinitely , an approach that is bound to produce excessive inflation . as a result , the option of so-called helicopter money has become increasingly discussed . it is often argued , monetizing fiscal deficits would commit central banks to keeping interest rates low forever , an approach bound to produce some mix of higher inflation and stronger real output . but the debate about this is riddled with re-precision . if governments run larger fiscal deficits and finance this not with interest-bearing debt but with central-bank money , nominal demand will undoubtedly escalate , producing some mix of higher inflation and stronger real output .
geneva – when lehman brothers declared bankruptcy ten years ago , it had suddenly become unclear who was willing and able to roll over what to do nothing and who would go down next . with policymakers struggling to respond to the crisis , economic pundits had left wondering whether the “ great moderation ” of low business-cycle volatility had been turned into yet another great depression . the result was that interbank credit markets froze , wall street panicked , and companies went under , not only in the united states but around the world . in hindsight , the complacency in the run-up to the crisis was distinctly unconscionable . and yet little changed in its aftermath .
should the spd , which votes on the coalition agreement in early december , block the formation of the new government ( an unlikely development , but not entirely out of the question ) , disputes over security and defense matters would not be the culprit . coalition partners disagree over how to sort this out are bound to sort out . for some , that is a cause for ambivalence . should the spd , which votes on the coalition agreement in early december , block the formation of the new government ( unlikely development , but completely out of that question ) , disputes over security and defense matters would not be the culprit . but they nonetheless agreed that , within the next year , the commission would provide differing options and models for protecting the german parliament ’s privileges , while providing assurances to germany ’s ’s european partners that the country would remain a reliable contributor to the troop deployments .
they typically argue that gm crops are unsafe – a view flatly rejected by the scientific community over the past two decades . badly needed bio-safety legislation in nigeria and uganda , for example , has already been delayed . indeed , any new gm crop variety must satisfy rigorous health , environmental , and efficacy standards . much of the issue lies with the small groups of anti-gm activists , who object to technology on “ moral grounds . ” moreover , the world health organization has affirmed that “ no impacts on human health have been shown as a consequence of consumption of such foods . ”
regulators may well need to turn to the bankruptcy laws aimed at fixing the problem . that solution will be incomplete , but it will be possible because not all derivatives traders are regulated by financial institutions , and because many lenders would find ways to circumvent the contract and the requirement . in the absence of complete coverage , one can expect the regulated to complain that it was placed at a competitive disadvantage . regulators may well find that they must turn to the bankruptcy laws in order to fix the problem . regulators may well find that they must require that the regulated have the desired contract provisions .
the result was section 124a of the penal code , under which any person who used “ words , ” conjecture , or visible representation … to excite disaffection toward the government ’s own nationality and faith could still prove inadequate , or in some respects unsuited , for a country under foreign rule . in other words , there was no free speech for indians . sedition was thus intended explicitly as a tool to terrorize indian nationalists ; in fact , mahatma gandhi was among his prominent victims , albeit far from his latest party . the british had concluded , in the words of britain ’s lieutenant governor of bengal , that “ sedition laws sufficacious for a people ruled by a government ruled by sedition and faith can be insufficient , or , in some respects unsuited , to a country under foreign rule . ” sedition was thus intended explicitly as a tool to terrorize indian nationalists ; in fact , mahatma gandhi was also one of its prominent victims , albeit far short of its latest .
seoul – china – already the world ’s largest exporter , a manufacturer , and the international-reserve-asset holder – is poised to overtake the united states as the world ’s largest economy ( measured in terms of purchasing power parity ) this year . after decades of engaging actively in international economic institutions , including the g-20 , the imf , world bank , and the world trade organization – china has begun to resemble revisionist power seeking to shape a new world order . indeed , the country ’s days of following deng xiaoping ’s injunction to hide brightness and cherish obscurity are long gone . now it is using its growing clout to reshape global economic governance . last month , china and 20 other asian countries signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a new multilateral development bank , the asian infrastructure investment bank .
these are , through all reasonable standards , remarkable uk-led achievements . achieving a global climate deal promises not only to protect the environment , but also to cement europe ’s role as the leader in sustainability . new free-trade agreements give european economies access to major markets around the world . progress toward the single market has helped to drive competitiveness . progress on the single market has helped to drive competitiveness .
a special report on semiconductors – vital to america ’s national security and economic competitiveness – for president barack ’s ’s ’s ’s council of advisors on science and technology ( pcast ) provides some answers . a report , written by a nonpartisan group of business and academic leaders ( i was a member ) , suggested that america work with its allies to enforce international law , push china to comply with its world trade organization obligations , and boost export controls and inward investment restrictions . a pcast report recommends american adoption of similar tactics , calibrating export controls , and inward investment limits on china ’s behavior . a special report on semiconductors – vital to america ’s national security and economic competitiveness – for president barack obama ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s council of advisors on science and technology ( pcast ) provides some answers . the report , written by a nonpartisan group of business and academic leaders ( which reviews and acquisitions at domestic companies through foreign actors ) , has proposed that america work with its allies to enforce international law , push china to comply with its world trade organization obligations , and boost export controls and inward investment restrictions .
four decades ago , countries not only endured opec ’s immediate economic impact ; they leveraged the potential of the ensuing oil shortfall to spur innovation . swift and determined action to make buildings more energy-efficient , design automobiles that require little or no fossil fuel , and raise the share of renewable power in us electricity consumption could ensure that the substantially hotter and less pleasant world of 2050 was not only likely to see the ipcc warns off . four decades ago , countries not only endured opec ’s immediate economic impact ; they leveraged the potential of the ensuing oil shortfall to spur innovation . our livelihoods , not to mention those of future generations , should not be finding themselves hostage to our ongoing addiction to fossil fuels . a rocky mountain institute ’s reinventing wildfire analysis shows that such a future is achievable , offering a market-driven strategy for a lucky american economy that is 158 % larger in 2050 , without dependence on oil , coal , or nuclear energy .
on the same day , hamas launched three powerful , iranian-designed rockets from gaza ’s dimona reactor . the captured uranium was not weapons-grade ; international inspectors removed all sensitive materials from iraq following the 1991 gulf war ( which is to be absent when the united states invaded in 2003 ) . luckily , two missed of the target , and israel managed to intercept the third . but the episode represented a severe escalation of hostilities and served as an important reminder of the vulnerability of nuclear reactors in warsaw . but what international reaction , if any , would have been initiated had the caczones been highly enriched ?
furthermore , the 9/11 surge in oil prices – which has raised concerns about another negative growth shock – has been roiling . in fact , the american economy is reflecting on this dichotomies . labor markets remain largely sound , even in otherwise anemic economies like germany , and household consumption remains strong in most major economies . although dollar appreciation has taken some pressures from non-us economies that depend on exports or foreign capital , it has heightened the risk of an open currency war . the american economy also reflects this dichotomies .
in the personal-computing business – which moved from bulky apple ii to an sleek and intelligent iphone 4s ( announced a day before steve ’s death ) – steve jobs was the only true showman of what ’s now the world ’s largest industries . he inspired broad public enthusiasm on the high-quality of his produce , and his personal charisma . for some reason , that was held at a playboy resort in lake geneva ( never again ! ) . ( others became entrepreneurial , but only steve became someone known and admired by millions , including the romanian waiter at the british airways of which i sat now . ) i first met steve back in 1979 or 1980 , at ben rosen ’s personal computer forum .
cambridge – america ’s real gdp growth rate , at 3.2 % for the first quarter of this year , is impressive , having been the equivalent of 3 % growth in 2018 ( measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 ) . from 2011 to 2017 , what accounts for the recent acceleration ? since the late great recession , from 2011 to 2017 , america ’s economy has been growing at a mere 2.1 % a year , on average . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . after all , what accounts for the recent acceleration ?
but if those countries would replace their open lists with closed lists , the percent of women elected should all else remain equal , rising at around 10 % . in closed-list systems , candidate lists should be zippered : male , female , female , female ( or vice versa ) . in open-list systems , it would be impossible to predict the impact of the increased quota percentages in the open-list systems that currently have efficient quota legislation . the impact would be greatest ( resulting in about 20 % of a jump in the percentage of women elected ) in systems that currently lack effective quota legislation . in closed-list systems , candidate lists should be zippered : male , female , female , female ( or vice versa ) .
likewise , he flouted the constitutional prohibition on accepting emoluments – the money or personal benefits that foreign governments do business , sometimes extravagant share , at his various hotels and golf clubs , and found other ways to monetize the presidency . trump has systematically defied the separation of powers at his heart of america ’s constitutional system . for example , frustrated that the us congress has denied him any funds that he wanted for his phantasmagorical wall , along with mexico , has simply plucked the money from the funds that the us congress allocated for the department of defense . and , according to special counsel robert mueller ’s report , trump has tried to obstruct his 2016 campaign ’s investigation with russia . moreover , trump has tried to steer administration deals toward favored corporations , rather than out of those he dislikes , for example , amazon , whose founder , jeff bezos , also owns the washington post .
at times , debt-service payments are rescheduled and perhaps lengthened over a longer period , giving a debtor country time to regain its capacity to pay . when debt becomes unsustainable , there are a few possible bargaining outcomes . argentina defaulted on its debt in 2001 on its own . sometimes , debt-service payments are rescheduled and perhaps stretched over a longer time , thereby giving a debtor country time to reclaim its ability to pay . few governments refuse to pay at all .
in places like vietnam , indonesia , and china , where a pandemic strain will most likely originate in recent months , expertise , coordination , discipline , and infrastructure missing the line . a strategy can , however , be “ cost-effective ” only if it is feasible . this ‘ tipping point ’ strategies are highly cost-effective , at least in theory . while the prophylaxis might work in minneapolis , toronto , or zurich , in parts of the world where flu pandemics begins , the probability of success approaches zero . the response in turkey , where as many as 50 possible cases have appeared in eastern ukraine , is instructive .
deng xiaoping ’s reforms have ignited the most rapid economic improvements in human history , and with it the emergence of a large and growing middle class . it helps to finance other countries ’ trade deficits , as well as domestic investment ( many of its recipients have large budget deficits that are reducing national saving below domestic investment ) . moreover , china sits on roughly $ 3.3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves – much of it in dollars , but also in other major currencies , owing to its huge trade surplus in recent decades . it remains the vitally important assembly center for the global supply chain for a wide range of manufactured goods , such as computers and cellular telephony , enabled by lower prices for the world ’s consumers . it remains the vitally important assembly center for the global supply chain for a wide range of manufactured goods , such as computers and cellphones , enabled lower prices for the world ’s consumers .
with the exception of the 1990 ’s , wars were not fought against or within countries with nuclear reactors . history offers little guidance , as to whether the warring countries would avoid damaging their nuclear sites . even ukrainians born after 1986 have understood what a chernobyl-type catastrophe brought on by fighting might look like . for ukraine , angst is real . in the balkans , serbian military jets overflew slovenia ’s krško nuclear power plant in a threatening gesture early in the conflict , whereas radical serbian nationalists have called for their attacks to release their country ’s radioactive contents .
for the past two years or so , saudi arabia has made it starkly apparent that it will not easily renounce its market share – to anyone . it has pursued a campaign to recover its former location not only in crude , but also in petroleum products , natural-gas liquids , and petrochemicals . it has pursued a campaign to recover its former position not only in crude , but also in petroleum products , natural gas liquids , and petrochemicals . to this end , it has sustained a price war , backed by a manufacturing boom , aimed at pressuring weaker competitors . once the doors to asia became open , however , russian companies have seized the opportunity to enter the downstream markets of india and indonesia , two countries that are critical to the saudis ’ own strategy .
indeed , attaining , prospering , and flourishing all refer to experiential rewards rather than money . this is the type of economy that i hope that china will develop . history suggests that it would be one of entrepreneurial people ( alert to unnoticed opportunities , and exercising their initiative in trying out new ones ) and innovative people ( imagining new things , developing new concepts into commercial products and methods , and marketing them to potential ) . participants in such a good economy would range from grassroots society to society ’s most advantaged . participants in such a good economy would range from grassroots involvement in society to their most advantaged .
as a recent article in the financial times points out , in two regions notoriously immune to the rise in productivity , education , and health care , technology already is reducing the demand for skilled labor . for those who dread the threat that automation poses to low-skill labor , a ready answer is to train people for better jobs . but , for now , technological progress seems to be eating out ever-better jobs , too . a broad range of jobs that we think of for now as skilled , secure , and irreducibly human might mean the next casualties of technological change . ( though perhaps that is n’t automation proper , the supermarket has just shifted some of the hard work of shopping onto a customer . )
in april , gunmen invaded home in an impoverished roma widow , maria balogh , who was shot her to death , injuring her 13-year-old daughter . in april , a roma couple was killed in northeastern hungary . in april , a roma father and his five-year-old son were killed outside their home near budapest . the home was burned there , last november , when the home was burned down in northeastern hungary . the home was burned down in northeastern hungary last november .
with american workers already competing against robots at home and against low-wage workers abroad , disruption of imports will just create more jobs for bots . in fact , trump should be protecting individual workers , not individual jobs . with american workers already competing against robots at home and against low-wage workers abroad , disrupting imports will just create more jobs for robots . the information revolution has changed the world in ways that tariffs can not reverse . a more rational approach would accept twenty-first-century realities .
iran did come close to developing a nuclear bomb , but never has it , whereas iran very well could . he very probably means what he says about the jews and israel , but is he the latter-day hitler , and is today iran the equivalent of germany in the 1930 ’s ? iran ’s results ’s recent municipal elections have been humiliating for ahmadinejad and his supporters . those elections would have been unthinkable in nazi germany , and they would have been entirely unthinkable . however , hitler came close to developing a nuclear bomb but never had it , whereas iran very well could .
but this does require a wealthy reservoir of ideas rather than a unified , unified approach . what this means is that as long as european electorates insist on retaining sovereignty over fiscal and economic policymaking , shared responsibility will become a ring dream . the second principle is one of subsidiarity , holding that decision-making should be decentralized whenever possible . this ensures that local and regional priority are deemed alongside the effects of eurozone-wide harmonization and economies of scale . the final principle is the quality of subsidiarity , which holds that decision-making should be decentralized whenever possible .
george w. bush ’s economic policies were based on an extraordinarily reckless gamble that reflected a policy coalition of the two major powers : the super-rich and evangelical christians . the super-rich had one over-riding objective in joining the bush coalition : tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest households . evangelicals ran on the basis of so-called “ family values , ” ” ” ” meaning opposition to abortion and gay marriage , and the promises of active government support for religious activity , including direct payments to religious groups that they grant locally and internationally as well . the super-rich have had one over-riding objective in joining the bush coalition : tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest households . evangelicals have been put on the basis of so-called “ family values , ” ” ” ” meaning opposition to abortion and gay marriage , and the promises of active government support for religious activities , including direct payments to religious groups for social services that they grant locally and internationally .
to bolster purchasing power and stimulate consumption , tax cuts on low – and medium-low-income households – are essential . to be sure , eu member states should define the concrete form such economic stabilization programs take for themselves . public investment in infrastructure ( for example , the massive expansion of europe ’s railroad network ) , as well as in climate and environmental technology , will also be needed . japan in the early 1990 ’s wait too long to act and miss the right opportunity for a revisionist countermeasures , which japan has yet to recover from its own long period of stagnation . beyond easing some large eu countries are already on the brink of recession .
moreover , according to the mckinsey global institute , investment opportunities stemming from infrastructure demand in africa will total at least $ 150 billion annually by 2025 , reflecting 3.5 % annual growth . africa ’s value as a trade and investment partner is not news to europe as a whole . likewise , africa is home to strategic natural resources for emerging low-carbon industries , and is well positioned to play a pivotal role in renewable energy . for europe , africa ’s economic potential remains far from tapped . spending by us households and companies , estimated at $ 4 trillion in 2015 , is projected to hit $ 5.6 trillion globally by 2025 , reflects 3.5 % annual growth .
a far more competent placeholder would have been sergei ivanov , a former kgb man . but ivanov is also taller than putin , who at any rate was ultimately accomplished only by the rank of lieutenant general colonel . an obvious potential threat to putin ’s power , ivanov was passed there , and has since been relegated to the role of russia ’s “ chief botanist , ” ” ” ” ” overseeing the environment and transportation industries . despite his years in office , medvedev remains known more for his fancy ties and expensive watches than for his executive action . earlier this month , putin was re-inaugurated , or , rather , crowned – in spectacular fashion , with medvedev – again presumes the role of pliant prime minister .
cambridge – government programs to encourage pensioners are in trouble in any country , owing both to increasing life expectancy and a rising ratio of retirees to taxpayers . the problem is uniquely different in the united states , because america ’s “ trust fund ” system of social security creates a crisis when the fund gets exhausted . here is how america ’s system works : by law , a payroll tax is devoted entirely to financing a retiree . the problem will worsen in the years ahead , as the adverse demographic trend increases the fiscal burden of funding pension and health-care services . although the options at which time will be different from those facing other governments , the policies to avoid america ’s crisis are relevant for other countries that confront population aging .
he recently criticized bolivian president evo morales ’s threats to take away foreign assets because of his failure to seize foreign assets because of his failure to do so : “ radicalism is incompatible with the common sense that was necessary from someone who governs . ” indeed , while the scandals have bedeviled the regime , lula has been unabashedly reelected last year , with investors continuing to pour money into the stock market . lula remains popular with brazilians , because his populist rhetoric demonstrates genuine sympathy with less affluent and more foreign investors , because he has always tempered his radicalism to accommodate economic realities . more recently , he criticized bolivian president evo morales ’s threats to take away foreign assets because of his failure to seize foreign assets because of his failure to do so : “ radicalism is incompatible with the common sense needed from someone who governs . ” lula remains popular with brazilians , because his populist rhetoric demonstrates genuine sympathy with the less affluent and with foreign investors alike that the political system has always tempered his radicalism in order to accommodate economic realities .
true , morales resigned when the military told him and whose terms he had accepted , then refused to certify the outcome . but it was subsequently followed by existing constitutional provisions . true , morales resigned when the military had told him to , and after agreeing to protesters ’ demands in exchange for a new vote . the constitutional court that allowed morales to run deemed legal of his own ; timely election was promised ; and the military did not assume power . the bolivian military was arrested by the time the military was told , without force .
and they resent – to take the point of mobilizing in the streets – any sign that a clique at the very top is barring their way . this is a sort of free , democratic spirit that operates outside the convention that the elections will decide the government . it has been fueled by enormously quickly by social media ( itself a revolutionary phenomenon ) . this is neither always consistent nor rational . and it moves very quickly in precipitating crises .
this left them free to build their own versions of national capitalism , as long as they complied with some simple international rules . the current crisis demonstrates how far we came from that model . when chinese-style capitalism met american-style capitalism , with few safety valves in place , it provided an explosive mix . the countries were obliged to make commit only limited trade liberalization , with ample exceptions for socially sensitive industries ( agriculture , textiles , services ) . financial globalization , in particular , played havoc with the old system .
you and i may depend on one another , but if i depend less on you than you do on me , my bargaining power is increased . for decades , both america and saudi arabia had a balance of asymmetries within which the us depended on them as the swing producer of petroleum products and depended on the us for ultimate military security . you and i may depend on one another , but if i depend less on you than you do on me , my bargaining power is increased . what power stems from the asymmetries within which we depended on interdependence . so even if america did not have many other interests in the middle east like israel or nuclear non-proliferation , a balance of energy imports and exports was unlikely to free america from military expenditures – which some experts forecast run to $ 50 billion a year – to protect the oil routes of the region .
at the national level , lack of political will has made the craven use of referenda , such as the french and dutch plebiscites on the treaty establishing a european constitution in 2005 , the netherlands ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ vote on eu-ukraine deal last april , and the brexit referendum almost three months later . in any event , polish voters argued , “ no ” is outcomes to blame , particularly in the united kingdom , on national leaders ’ habit of blaming the eu for domestic problems . indeed , european leaders ’ parochialism is a major reason why the eu is failing to retain broad-based public support . the lack of historical vision among current generations of political leadership undermines the shared sense of purpose needed to make eu citizens feel that they are part of the same community , regardless of their own different national identity . european commission president jean-claude juncker , for example , openly frets about the deep divisions among the eu ’s member states over brexit , and questions whether “ hungarians and poles ” want precisely the same thing as germans and french .
florence – british policy has always been something of the experimental laboratory over the industrialized world . in the 1970s , britain was where the preeminent postwar model of how to manage the economy collapsed . today , the equivalent collapse has been of the “ regulation-lite of the ” regime , in which a party that styled itself as the “ new labour ” embraced a powerful role for markets , notably for mostly deregulated financial markets . in the 1970s , britain was where the preeminent postwar model of how to manage the economy collapsed . that model was based politically politically on creating consensus and economically management .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on its present for many years to come . in fact , palestine ’s religious landmarks are attracting rising numbers of religious tourists worldwide every year . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
they know that their cities are also vulnerable to urban violence , to the extent that they have pockets of social inequality , including the marginalized and excluded young people . as french cities have been burned , other countries found it difficult to judge france . nevertheless , mayors across europe have responded more moderately , feeling , and show solidarity with the plight of their french colleagues . other countries ’ governments appear to have sought to distance themselves from the issue , fearing contagion that they know is likely to spread . embassies have issued warnings to tourists and their citizens living in france ; tv news programs show hours of footage of burning cars .
and the rapid economic growth that china ’s leaders must sustain , in order to lift vast numbers of people out of poverty , thereby countering a crisis of legitimacy , places a floor beneath global food , energy , and mineral prices . to be sure , intensity of use has collapsed for some commodities , like gold and nuclear energy ; but , for others , such as aluminum and coal , it has surged since 2000 , or , as was the case for copenhagen and oil , declines steeply or at high levels . still , supply in most commodities is forecast to grow at no more than 2 % annually in real terms . as long as china ’s commodity demand grows at a rate higher than global supply , prices are likely to rise . all else being equal , unless china ’s commodity intensity , defined as that of a commodity consumed to generate a unit of output , is falling dramatically , its demand for commodities will become larger this year than it was last year .
severe shortages of life-saving drugs in venezuela are a result of the government ’s implicit default on a $ 3.5 billion bill for pharmaceutical imports . in the automobile sector , defaults exceed $ 3 billion earlier this year , leading to a substantial staple deficiency . payment arrears on food imports amount to $ 2.4 billion , leading to a substantial staple deficiency . earlier this year , he was diagnosed with terminal cancer , and had to launch a social-media campaign to locate the drugs he demanded . a similar situation prevails throughout the rest of the economy .
after all , turkey is already , for example , a functioning democracy . likewise , while egypt is in the midst of a messy revolution and must give priority to internal change , it , too , intends to recapture a more visible and influential role within the palestinian national movement ( s ) and in the region as a whole . the middle east ’s “ middle east ” will no longer remain a sleeping giant . turkey , of course , is less destabilized than its arab rivals and partners through a revolutionary process that does not directly challenge it . will it also have to gain the bomb ?
the desire to limit or protect some forms of free-market human action may be understandable , particularly in countries like poland , where free markets remain an unknown avenue for change . these state-controlled benefits have little to do with the righteousness supposedly wanted by its socialist promoters , but everything to rent-seeking and corruption . but in a situation in which many fields of social life – such as education , health , and social services – need quickly and radical change , reinstatement the free market to do its work provides the only plausible avenue for change . state-owned health-insurance companies , the state guaranteed to retirement , etc. are not only insecure and inefficient ; they also run counter to the idea of political reform . if “ constitutionalized ” , they have simply implant the idea that the constitution is a statement of aspirations , rather than a set of enforceable legal rights .
so , too , is the work of india ’s fashion designers , striding around the world . an indian art , classical services , and france , for example , have much in common . youtube ’s movies , reaching their glitzy fun far beyond the indian diaspora in the united states and the united kingdom , offer yet another example . a senegalese friend told me of a illiterate mother taking a bus to dakar earlier this month to watch a boollywood film , does not understand hindi dialogues and can not read french subtitles , but can still catch the spirit of movies and grasp the story , and people like her gaze at india with stars in their eyes as they arise . an indian diplomat in damascus some years ago told me that the only publicly displayed portraits as the big portion of then-president hafez al-assad was of bollywood superstar amitabh bachchan .
new delhi – barack obama , india ’s sixth american president , to visit india since it gained its independence , arrives at an effort time in both the united states and india . some of obama ’s closest advisers have just resigned , launching an awkward national security gap and the economy , targeting his meetings with india ’s ’s government . bilateral economic , trade , and currency disagreements may not be as bitter as they are between america and china , but obviously thorny and lack of resolution makes them more intractable . for india , the issues on the agenda for obama ’s visit are both immense and complex , and the options for resolving them are exceedingly limited . those related to security-related issues in afghanistan and pakistan are as treacherous as they have ever been .
through social media , the resulting discontent now spreads faster than ever , leading to destructive politics . a combination of bad politics and economics in one country can easily fuel contagion , as rising migration spreads , political stress , and instability toward other countries . this can invite geopolitical interference , which quickly worsens into a lose-lose scenario like that already evident in water-stressed and conflict-affected countries , where governments are fragile or failing . according to the un high commission on refugees , up to 65 million refugees in the last year , compared to just 1.6 million in 1960 . moreover , knowledge-intensive technology has the winner-take-all network effects whereby hubs take on access to knowledge and power , leaving less-privileged groups , classes , industries , and regions struggling to compete .
many cited former british prime minister david cameron ’s decision to allow scotland to hold an independence referendum in 2014 . but such a process is still unlawful under the spanish constitution of 1978 . and , as it explicitly states , it is “ based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , ” ” ” ” ” with sovereignty belonging to the spanish people . in short , spain is one nation , indivisible . that constitution marked the country ’s passage from dictatorship to democracy , and provides spain ’s rule-of-law system .
geneva – since the 2008 financial crisis , we have squandered far too little power seeking to turn back into an era of rapid economic expansion . the post-crisis era is over , and the “ post-post-crisis world ” is upon us . the flawed premise that the post-crisis world ’s challenges were only temporary has underpinned policies that yielded only lackluster recoveries while failing to tackle key issues like high unemployment and rising inequalities . it is time to adopt a new framework of realistic solutions that promote shared prosperity within today ’s global economy and tomorrow . geneva – the world needs a long time to stop at this point in the cold .
indeed , it is notable that whereas obama ’s state of the union address in january 2010 , at least mentioned doha , his address in june 2011 did not . america ’s president is captive to the land of ’s labor unions , who have bought into the false narrative that trade with poor countries increases the ranks of the poor by driving down wages . obama has confined himself to promoting pending bilateral deals with colombia and other emerging-market countries . these were emphasized in a “ open letter to obama ” that i organized and released , over a signatures of nearly 50 of today ’s most influential trade experts worldwide , urging a presidential shift in doha . obama has confined to promoting pending bilateral deals with colombia and other emerging-market countries .
these new worries raise alarm bells in china . some people have even forecast a double-dip recession . should that happen , the chance of a actual american default would be far higher than it is today . to be sure , these new worries are raising alarm bells in china . diversification away from dollar assets is the day ’s advice .
berkeley – investors worldwide are increasingly looking for investment opportunities that promise to bring environmental and social benefits in addition to market rates of returns . one signatory , calpers , one of the world ’s largest institutional investors , has gone a step further : it will require all of its investment managers to identify and integrate esg factors into their decisions , a bold move that could transform capital markets further . if this trend continues , with an environmental or social goal enhancing investment in their value , it will bolster a commitment to sustainability that is already gaining momentum among companies worldwide . last year , one out of every six dollars of assets under professional management in the united states , the combined total of $ 6.6 trillion , was allocated to some form of sustainable investment , particularly for public equities . at the world bank , some 1,260 companies , managing $ 45 trillion worth of assets under professional management , are signatories of the united nations ’ “ fundamentals of responsible investment , ” ” which recognizes environmental , social , and governance ( esg ) factors , and thus the long-term health and stability of companies and markets , as critical to investors .
in some sense , however , this might seem to be a good thing . more varied perspectives could enrich multilateral processes and generate more comprehensive solutions to global problems . the perception today is that america ’s unipolar moment has come to an end ; europe is on the decline ; and a new set of powers is on the rise , bringing its own unique worldviews into globalized affairs . in international politics , perceptions matter , sometimes even greater than reality . more varied perspectives could enrich multilateral processes and generate more comprehensive solutions for global problems .
to its credit , the british egg industry embraced the situation and developed new and less vicious methods for keeping hens in power . in britain and some european countries , animal welfare became politically salient , and pressure on parliamentary representatives mounted . the european union established a scientific panel to investigate animal-welfare issues on farm issues , and the committee recommended banning battery cage alongside some other forms of close confinement of pigs and calves . a ban on the eu ’s battery cages was ultimately adopted in 1999 , but to ensure that it would have enough time for producers to phase out investment-oriented plants , its implementation was delayed until january 1 , 2012 . some supermarket chains even stopped transporting eggs from battery hens .
more broadly , instead of aiding people only when social risks materialize , public policy could encourage individuals throughout their working lives by adopting a more effective , bespoke approach that fits peoples ’ needs better than coarsely tailored schemes tailored for themselves . finally , the very same accounts could serve as public-policy vehicles . this might sound utopian ; in some ways , it is . but at a time when any digital service has become more and more personalized , why should social policy remain confined to twentieth-century philosophy and solutions ? early school-leavers , for example , could serve as public-policy vehicles .
but corruption poses the single largest obstacle to growth and development in many countries , particularly as it diverts resources from the poor . indeed , outspokenness was the hallmark of wolfensohn ’s tenure . a number of chief cabinet secretary , bank officer and ngo ’s representative had experienced his blunt criticism just as she was his effusive praise . the world bank had insisted that he was seen as malnourishment , and that fights it is made synonymous with fighting poverty . indeed , outspokenness was the hallmark of wolfensohn ’s tenure .
it is a revisionist power vis-à-vis the global financial architecture that seeks an overhaul of the bretton woods system . but it is a status quo power with respect to the un system and steadfastness opposes enlargement of the security council by the permanent membership of the un . in fact , the modest actions carried out in response to the changing distribution of global power have , in reality , been limited to the realm of economic reform , with the hard core of international relations – peace and security – remaining the exclusive preserve of a few countries . china is not on the same page as the other brics countries when it comes to global institutional reform . the g20 ’s formation , for example , was the improvisation designed to defer genuine financial reform .
whether it will depend heavily on whether important instruments supporting equality of opportunity , principally education and health care , are universally accessible . rising inequalities in fact need not bring down intergenerational mobility , among other things . it may lead to gridlock , conflict , or poor political choices . the evidence supports the view that the systematic elimination of subgroups on any arbitrary basis ( such as ethnicity , race , or religion ) is especially harmful in this respect . intergenerational mobility is a key indicator of equality of opportunity .
if used wisely , such platforms could take up the slack created by governments ’ fiscal constraints to facilitate the entrepreneurial innovations needed to build blue economies . last may , eureeca.com took the crowdfunding concept still further than ever , creating the first truly global crowd-investing marketplace that is offering equity stakes in financed companies . other increasingly prominent trends , like collaborative consumption , paying per se , and sharing and leasing models , could offer a similarly potent impetus to these efforts . of the roughly fortune 500 crowdfunding platforms that are now operating , several specifically targets clean technologies . the proliferation of information technology and social media means that it is easier than ever to tap entrepreneurs into a large pool of finance , not to mention contacts and expertise – from small investors .
then , in 1971 , fighting broke out when bangladesh , then known as east pakistan , proclaimed independence from pakistan . the standard of living back then was poor , and a dearth of intravenous line meant that rehydration solutions could not have widely administered to cholera outbreaks . in the ensuing conflict , refugees poured across the border into neighboring india into crowded camps , creating conditions that inevitably gave rise to cholera outbreaks . as many on the left dying , a pioneering physician dilip mahalanabis assumed a chance in a desperately difficult situation . bangladesh knows wartime cholera all too well .
madrid – april 22 , 2017 , international earth day marks one year since the signing of the paris climate agreement , which entered into force last november , and now has 195 signatories . that landmark multilateral treaty still represents the most significant steps forward to date in the global fight against climate change . in 2016 , the hottest year on record , average global temperatures were 0.9 º c above twentieth-century average . yet its first anniversary has been aggravated by us president donald trump ’s energy policies . the paris agreement has a primary objective to prevent the average world temperature from rising more than 2º c above pre-industrial levels by 2100 .
the atheistic nature of today ’s civilization ( ours is the first atheistic civilization in humankind ’s history and , also , its first civilization , which embraces the whole planet ) coincides deeply , i believe , with the hyper-trophic pursuit of individual interests and individual responsibilities , together with the crisis of global responsibilities . the atheistic nature of today ’s civilization ( ours is the first atheistic civilization in humankind ’s history and also the first civilization to which it embraces the whole planet ) coincides deep , i believe , with the hyper-trophic pursuit of individual interests and individual responsibilities combined with the crisis of global responsibilities . the atheistic nature of today ’s civilization ( ours is the first atheistic civilization in humankind ’s history and also the first civilization to which embraces the entire planet ) coincides deep , i believe , with the hypertrophic pursuit of individual national interests and individual responsibilities combined with the crisis of global responsibilities . but how to become a shared attitude toward what lies above us if people across the globe have a very different image of which lies above , not but is the product of the loss of a metaphysical certitude , of the loss of god ? is there any sense in trying to turn human mind to the heavens when such a turn would merely exacerbate conflicts on earth among followers of our various deities ?
she has thrown down the gauntlet to some of the world ’s major economies : tell us when you will phase out coal , end harmful fossil-fuel subsidies , and shift taxation from income to pollution . these are the decisions that will drivethe transformation the world needs . a more ambitious effort by energy providers and the major end users is critical , because it extends affordable and reliable clean-energy services to everyone who needs them . at the heart of this transformation is the energy transition that , though progress is being made , tends to delay or has stalled in much of the world . those are the choices that will drivethe transformation the world needs .
new haven – central bankers worldwide have not failed to see the current financial crisis coming before it came to light in 2007 . martin čihák of the international monetary fund reported in july 2007 that , of the 47 central banks found that publishing the financial stability report ( fci ) , virtually all of the big bang has given a “ positive overall assessment of their home financial system ” ” in their most recent report , fixing the financial system . macro-prudential regulators ( government officials who are focusing not on the soundness of individual financial institutions , but rather on stability in the financial system itself ) are re-needed , and central bankers are the logical people to fill that role . and yet , though these central banks failed the us congress before the crisis , even they should still be playing a leading role in preventing another crisis . that , perhaps counterintuitive , is the conclusion that the squam lake group [ http:///squamlakegroupmlakegroup/ ] , a think tank of the 15 academic financial economists to whom i belong , reached in our recently published paper , fixing the financial system .
that credo benefited tens of millions of newcomers and immeasurably strengthens america . sadly , in making that choice , the us president opted to turn away from america ’s classic vision engraved at the pedestal of the new york harbor statue of liberty , expressed in emma lazarus ’s poem that begin – “ to give me your smack , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . ” and , even after his cancellation was first announced , he declared his intention to resolve the daca ’s question , with its heart and compassion . yet , apparently convinced that the daca beneficiaries had taken jobs away from their citizens , he concluded that the same heart and compassion was required “ for the unemployed , struggling , and forgotten americans . ” and , even after vowing during the presidential election to end the bbc , he also acknowledged the moral case to be made for maintaining it , saying that it would be confronted with a “ very hard ” choice .
they want the oil and mining concessions that are to be allocated efficiently , maximally , and maximize the government ’s revenue . trying to accomplish these valuable tasks , while paying below-market salaries , is penny raw but pound folly . tax collectors , regulators , and prosecutors need reasonable resources to win their hard battles . amlo ’s decision to lower public employees ’ wages has already led a number of top officials to look for employment elsewhere . those who have the right to early retirement take it up rather than wait for amlo to cut it .
and the international energy agency reports that global temperatures are on track to rise to 3.6-5.3 degrees celsius ( 6.5-9.5 ° fahrenheit ) above pre-industrial levels , far more than the two degrees that climate scientists have identified as a threshold beyond which the most catastrophic effects of climate change would be triggered . moreover , in order to accelerate the pace of energy-related innovation , creative coalitions among governments , private firms , and civil-society groups should be formed on three major fields . first , the first coalition – comprising a set of committed governments – would seek to drive down the cost of renewables at least one in ten years , with fossil-fuel-based power generation . moreover , global co2 emissions reached a record high in 2012 . the first coalition , comprising a set of committed governments , would seek to drive down the cost of renewable energy at least to that of fossil fuels in the next decade .
sao paulo – as well-intentioned gestures move , earth hour is hard to beat . first organized in sydney , australia , on 2007 by the grassroots chapter of the world wildlife fund , its popularity and levels of involvement ( both individual and official ) that generates have burst over the past few years to the point that there is barely a corner of the earth that the campaign has not touched . at a stroke of 8:m. on saturday , march 27 , nearly a billion people in over 120 countries demonstrated their desire to do something about global warming by turning off their lights for one hour . on a display of official solidarity , the lights also went out at many planetary blot with the most iconic landmarks , from the opera house in sydney to the great pyramid at giza , not to mention beijing ’s forbidden city , new york city building , london ’s great ben , paris ’s eiffel tower , and skyline via both hong kong and las vegas . what ever could matter , earth hour is surely one of the greatest successful publicity stunts ever dreamed up .
but britain joined the european community , not just the free-trade area that cameron now apparently wanted . indeed , in his speech to the european parliament , cameron was unable to resist a passing shooting shot at the european court of justice . even the supremacy of european law in defined areas was accepted only reluctantly by britain , long after many others did so . even the supremacy of european law in defined areas was accepted only reluctantly by britain , and long after many others did so . essentially , a british perspective was that the loose confederation of nation-states cooperating on trade was as much european as the uk needs .
research for the global commission on the economy and climate last year calculated that particulate matter alone caused 1.23 million premature deaths in china – the world ’s top coal-consuming economy – in 2010 . to be sure , the coal industry has helped billions of people escape poverty , not least in china , where coal-fired power has underpinned nearly 700 % of per capita income growth since 1990 . but human health is at an even greater risk , in countries that are burning more coal . research for 2012 suggests that 88 % of the air-pollution-related fatalities occur at low levels – to middle-income countries , representing 82 % of the world ’s population . research for the global commission on the economy and climate last year calculated that particulate matter alone caused 1.23 million premature deaths in china – the world ’s top coal-consuming economy – in 2010 .
occasionally , however , this longing appears overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere . indeed , the term democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of fast-passing fads ; today ’s hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow , with always more waiting in the wings . by calling for more referenda , both reflect and fuels this trend . in politics , this can be dangerous , because it encourages basing choices , regardless of how weighty , on whatever popular view momentarily prevails . referenda , it is for the most part a snapshots .
sadly , i get many messages headlined , “ updates . ” the best-case line says what the message is about , and signals the desired response : “ an invitation to speak in paris on july 14 . she could , perhaps , say “ “ “ “ message for president obama ” message to you ” whether she is sharing an open letter but otherwise … otherwise … . unless i know that a person ’s name , maybe i ca n’t even know what company it ’s about . or , “ investment design for your consideration , ” or “ serve as a reference ? ”
and yet the changes currently afoot could just turn things around . india ’s octogenarian prime minister , manmohan singh , has recently awakened to a desperate need for renewed momentum . but it is far from obvious that sonia gandhi , the president of india ’s national congress , and the country , ’s most powerful politician , shares singh ’s ’s reform agenda . economists around the world took note of the arrival of raghuram rajan as chief economist at the ministry of finance . rajan is a superstar academic researcher , the brilliant academic researcher at the political economy , and a former imf chief economist .
the separation of powers , free speech , and free elections alone can not ensure an open society ; a strong commitment to the pursuit of truth also is required . politicians will respect , rather than manipulate , reality only if the public also cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in an deliber­ate deception . we must abandon popper ’s tacit assumption that the goal of political discourse is to gain a better understanding of reality , and to reintroduce it as an explicit requirement . indeed , we must establish new rules of the rules of the road for political discourse . these can not be identi­cal to a scientific method , but they should be similar in their character , enshrining the pursuit of truth as criteria that are intended to be judged by political views .
the explanations range from anthropological to borderline racist : indians lack the genes , the building , the stamina , the climate , whatever . but those rationales will not do : other developing countries , from jamaica to ethiopia , regularly rake in their medals . we are a developing country , it is said ; after all , it is not only an eye-popping light against his , your legs against the jungles , but what you can do against their trainer , his running shoe , their ergodynamic costume , their titanium ’s archer ’s bow . so why are indian athletes doing so badly ? there are structural and infrastructural explanations : the lack of training facilities , gymnasiums , running tracks , appliances , finance .
soon enough , the bush administration became obsessed with promoting the idea that iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction despite the absence of any conclusive proof . as early as january 1998 , the neoconservative " fresh american century project " sent a letter to then-president bill clinton urging him to topple saddam hussein . not coincidentally , bush ’s administration included ten of the bush administration 's 25 signatories of the bush administration 's founding statement of principles , including dick cheney as vice president and donald rumsfeld as defense secretary . in september 2002 , rumsfeld received the now-declassified us intelligence report stating that , “ we ca n’t know with any precision how much we do n’t know ” about the “ status of wmd programs ” ” ” ” ” in iraq . and , following his victory in 2000 , bush declared iraq one of his top two security priorities .
the iranian leadership formed after the revolution consisted of the narrow ruling stratum , and iran ’s islamic revolution was no exception . in the 20 years since khomeini ’s death , the composition of that political class drastically changed . the greatest difference from 2009 to 1979 was shaped by the revolution itself . the iranian leadership formed after the revolution consisted of the narrow ruling stratum , and the much broader support group that was given charge of administration and political mobilization . the clerical elite gradually lost power to the military-security groups from whose ranks president mahmoud ahmadinejad emerged .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . but we should not exaggerate the significance of this perspective . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the current one for many years to come . targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
at last , we need fact-based solutions . research shows that many girls around the world , and especially those in the global south , are simply not prepared for menarche ; education can help . research shows that many girls around the world , and especially those in the global south , are simply not prepared for menarche ; education can help . finally , we need fact-based solutions . research shows that many girls around the world , and especially those in the global south , are simply not prepared for menarche ; education can help .
under these conditions , it would become more surprising if the depositors did not rush to withdraw their funds from greek banks . indeed , economists have long understood that , far from being a credible lender of last resort , banks are vulnerable to self-fulfilling confidence crises . that lender can be monetary or fiscal , and in greece , both types are ultimately at odds . and the greek state does not have the wherewithal to stand behind its banks . if greece does agree with the eu and the imf unravels , the european central bank will no longer embrace greek bonds as collateral .
on the one hand , it is important to resist putin ’s game-changing challenge to the post-1945 liberal order , ’s prohibition on the use of force by states to seize territory from their neighbors . in the short run , however , declining countries often take on more risk , and thus have a greater danger in the future , witness the austro-hungarian empire of 1914 . president vladimir putin ’s intervention in neighboring countries and the middle east , and its cyber-attacks on america and others , however intended to make russia look great again , merely worsen the country ’s long-term prospects . on the one hand , it is important to resist putin ’s game-changing challenge to the post-1945 liberal order , ’s prohibition of using force by states to seize territory from their neighbors . when it comes to power , russia , virtually totally dependent on the revenues generated by its power resources , is an “ one crop economy ” with corrupt institutions and insurmountable demographic and health problems .
the continuing poker game between the greek government and the troika ( the european commission , the european central bank , and the international monetary fund ) hurts all the parties involved – and most of all . greece needs both money and reform , fast and within the eurozone and the eu . preventing the eu from falling apart will require , first and foremost , a strategic solution to the greek crisis . governments in athens , brussels , and even berlin can not live with greece as a failed state and economy . it may ultimately end only with greece ’s renewed bailout , or with europe ’s plunge into disaster .
as trump embraces isolationism , the other so-called brics countries ( brazil , russia , india , and south africa ) have made it an alternative hegemonic power , one that comes without the west ’s colonial baggage or moralizing on the role of democracy and human rights . trump ’s presidency is providing new opportunities for china to cement its role as an investment provider and all sorts of infrastructure , and for infrastructure and assistance to a host of countries that are eager for development . indeed , china ’s ascent has given china a new orbit for many countries around the world , particularly developing and emerging economies . its china-ateralist approach is likely also likely to force america into playing catch-up with the world ’s near-unhinged china in its sustained effort to win over the hearts and minds of those whose countries it regards as vital , economically , and politically , to its strategic interests . and , indeed , china ’s rise has provided a new orbit for many countries around the world , particularly the developing and emerging economies .
austin – living in a town turned you into a cannibal . that , at least , is the metaphor favored by jean-jacques rousseau , who deemed cities a pit of human corruption . rousseau was so convinced of the malign effects of urbanization that it “ would rather see men grazing on meadow grass than gobbling one another in towns . urbanization informs people to the suffering of the countryside , and , like that of drew interspeople together , their compassion capacity towards others atrophies . urbanites become the type of people ready to sacrifice one another in order to indulge their appetites : cannibals .
the question at the beginning of 2019 , then , is what it will mean for the global economy , unless this scenario plays out . looking ahead , the 2021-2030 period , an annualized growth rate of 8 % ( compared to ten % ten years earlier ) and a gradual increase in consumption to 50 % of gdp , would translate into chinese consumer spending of $ 18.4 trillion per year by 2030 . in this scenario , chinese consumption would surpass that of america in the dollar terms . if apple ’s recent guidance points to a steep , indefinite contraction of chinese consumption , will american consumers once again serve as the sole engine of the global economy for the next ten years ? if not , could any other country fill that role , even in part ?
but , unlike many emerging economies , china is not struggling with a currency mismatch stemming from its large foreign-exchange reserves and persistent current-account surpluses , which make it a net lender to the rest of the world . first , with its bank-dominated financial system , china ( along with europe and many other emerging-market economies ) suffers from a maturity mismatch , owing to short-term borrowing costs and longer-term lending . at least four “ mismatches ” have lay at the root of the past global financial crises , and three plague china today . first , with its bank-dominated financial system , china ( along with europe and many other emerging-market economies ) suffers from a maturity mismatch , owing to short-term borrowing and longer-term lending . yet , in contrast to many emerging economies , china is not struggling with a currency mismatch , owing to its large foreign-exchange reserves and persistent current-account surpluses , which make it a net lender to the rest of the world .
reaffirming its commitment to the rapid decarbonization of its energy system , and to taking creative policies in promoting that goal , will help europe to continue to reap the rewards of one of the most notable new market opportunities in living memory . the events of the last 15 months , beginning with deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico , were followed by violence in north africa and the tragedy in japan , confront a stark choice between the costs and risks of traditional power utilities and the promise and progress of clean power . in recent decades , europe has been a motor of energy modernization . in the years ahead , such leadership will be needed to help capture the economic , environmental , and security advantages of renewable energy . in the years ahead , such leadership will be needed to help capture the economic , environmental , and security advantages of renewable energy .
for starters , protectionism often masquerades as labor , food , environmental , and phytosanitary standards , or as arguments for local content requirements , infant industries , protections for intellectual property , climate policies , dispute resolution , or human rights . human ingenuity seems to know no bounds when it comes to dreaming of protectionist barriers . for example , protectionism often masquerades as labor , food , environmental , and phytosanitary standards , or as arguments for local content requirements , infant industries , protections for intellectual property , climate policies , dispute resolution , or human rights . this non-tariff barriers to trade have remained in effect until april 1983 . human ingenuity seems to know no bounds when it comes to dreaming of protectionist barriers .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . washington , dc , to defeat populism requires that it grips with a fundamental reality : bad economic policies no longer necessarily lead to a government losing power . in fact , it is now entirely possible that irresponsible populists may in fact reinforce their chances of once again becoming reelected by making wilder and more impossible promises and causing further economic harm . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
two other destabilizing developments emerged over the last quarter-century : a strong incentive to use debt to prop up demand and a shift toward financing public debt through market-based private institutions , under the guise of combating inflation . as a result , by 2006 , global liquidity amounted to more than twice the value of world gdp . these trends boosted public-debt burdens , while flooding a global financial system with liquidity generated by private banking activities that were unconnected to transactions in the real economy . combined , the financial sector has since made every effort to design instruments that protect against price fluctuations , turn private debt into tradable financing securities , and regain access to speculative markets . however , these efforts have been conducive to fraud and delinquency , and thus spurred a wave of new financial crises , in europe in 1992 , and again in russia in 1998 , and again in 1998 – just as the recession in europe and the united states in the early 2000 .
similarly , the united kingdom has established a cost review program that identifies 40 major prioritization projects , reformed overall planning processes , and then created a cabinet subcommittee to ensure faster project delivery , thereby cutting infrastructure spending by at least 15 % . and chile ’s national public-investment system evaluates all of the proposed public projects that use standard forms , procedures , and metrics – and then creates a cabinet subcommittee to ensure faster project delivery , thereby cutting infrastructure spending by as much as 15 % . in australia , the state of new south wales cut approvals and land acquisition , structure contracts to encourage innovation and saving – and improving collaboration with contractors . in australia , the state of new south wales will cut approvals and land acquisition , structure contracts to encourage innovation and saving , and then create a cabinet subboard to ensure faster program delivery , thereby cutting infrastructure spending by up to 15 % . there is massive scope to accelerate bank approvals and land acquisition , structure contracts to provide incentives to encourage innovation and saving , and improve collaboration with contractors .
other categories involve entrepreneurship ( with entities like employers , industries , and employees ) , biology , space-flight , and many more , and encompassing representations – such as graphs , timelines , and desks – of how they are interconnected . and that means improved , more meaningful responses as we search . most things do not exist in isolation , but they do not exist in isolation . they have complex relationships to various matters , and by representing that information using verbs , for example , “ the company that google acquired ” vs. “ a company that google competes with ” we may represent the world more accurately . and that means improved , more meaningful responses to as we search .
last year , european commission vice president mike pence issued a call for voluntary action . now the european union is considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women , up from more than 60 % . the reding has invited corporations to sign on to gender-balance goals of a 40 % female board of membership . the forte foundation in america has now followed suit with its own “ ngo ready ” list . the forte foundation in america has now followed suit with its own list of female women .
cambridge – at the dawn of class each fall , i have tease my students with the following question : does it better to be poor in a rich country , or as rich in a poor country ? and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . the question , in particular , typically invites considerable , inconclusive discussion . but we can devise a more structured , limited version of the question for which there is a definitive answer . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
given such bonds are already aggressively priced , such a move could thus set it on falling when interest rates finally start to rise . indeed , america may well be in the process of adding a pension crisis to the unemployment problem . she has saved because she wanted enough money to retire . alternatively , the low interest rates could push her ( or her pension fund ) to buy risky long term bonds . she has saved because she wanted enough money to retire .
and yet , what has happened in zambia is related to those developments – and thus relevant everywhere . after all , smooth power transitions are not to be taken for granted . what made zambia ’s election so vital is that the challenger has won . indeed , he has defeated an incumbent , who really wanted to preserve the job , and who might be reasonably tempted to follow the lead of other african leaders , which has been defeated in the popular vote by simply refusing to concede the result . to be sure , the zambians ’ achievement can not compete with the intervention in libya , or with the turmoil of the arab spring .
while a policy of neutrality has allowed russia to maintain a dialogue with diverse parties , it will do nothing to create a new regional order . as it stands , syria is russia ’s only client state in the middle east . but russia has since become mired in local rivalries between syria and turkey , saudi arabia and iran , turkey , and the kurds , as well as israel and iran . its use of hard power has won the syrian civil war for president bashar al-assad ’s dictatorship , demonstrating how the strategic deployment of unrestrained military force – witness the utter destruction of aleppo – can be a game-changer . for its part , russia ’s diplomatic vulnerabilities have become starkly apparent in syria .
investors were willing to buy even 100-year bonds from a country with eight sovereign defaults over the past two centuries . investor enthusiasm and domestic political honeymoon lasted for as long as the international environment remained benign . but , once inflows faltered in 2018 , the imf had to step in again , closing an external financing gap with an astonishing $ 50 billion in loans to the imf ( later rose to $ 57 billion ) . investor enthusiasm and the domestic political honeymoon had lasted as long as the international environment remained benign . but , once the inflows faltered in 2018 , the imf had to step in yet again , closing the external financing gap with an astonishing $ 50 billion in loan scheme ( later raised to $ 57 billion ) .
moreover , alternative approaches to stimulating private demand might have fewer undesirable distributional consequences , as mgi has argued . indeed , boosting demand might give central banks the opening they need to shift interest rates back toward historic norms . this could take the air out of incipient assets bubbles , which may be creating and ease pressures on those institutional investors struggling to find the yields they need to meet its insurance and pension liabilities . helicopter money , proponents of helicopter money , directly undeserving citizens with central bank money , or the unappropriating national treasuries to finance infrastructure and other demand-generating activities , rightly argue that it has the advantage of putting money directly in the hands of those who will spend it . an appropriately sized <UNK> ter-money program might also raise inflation in a measured fashion , headed off a japanese-style deflationary trap .
more recently , ban assumed an active role in the gaza crisis in gaza . during the fighting in gaza , he publicly demanded a halt to the warfare , claiming that israel open gaza ’s borders to relief aid . he also visited the un compound in the heart of gaza to express the un ’s grave concerns over its bombardment . this followed the two visits that he had made to haiti during the last 18 months , and a donor ’s conference , which he sponsored in april , sought to raise $ 300 million in aid and investment . he also visited the un compound in the heart of gaza to express the un ’s grave concern over its bombardment .
according to the international monetary fund ’s april 2011 world economic outlook , though capital flows have risen globally , they are higher in emerging-market economies than in the advanced economies . moreover , the spillover effects of advanced economies ’ exchange-rate policies extend far beyond financial shocks . boom-and-bust financial cycles are driven largely by the shocks generated in the advanced economies , but are key determinants of emerging-market economies ’ business cycles . according to the international monetary fund ’s april 2011 world economic outlook , though capital flows have risen globally , they tend to be higher in emerging-market economies than in the advanced economies . moreover , emerging economies ’ spillover effects from developed countries ’ external imbalances extend far beyond financial shocks .
first , the unrivaled dominance of egypt ’s ’s ’s ’s military , and the unlikelihood of falling apart within its leadership makes any large-scale violence untenable , particularly given that the egyptian state ’s struggle against terrorism in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s greatly weakened jihadist groups ’ operational assets in the country . in a country with over 45 million people under the age of 35 , no political player with any strategic insight can afford to permit the prolonged mass impasse . finally , despite significant demographic and economic transformations in egypt over the past four decades , egyptian society still retains its agrarian character , which favors conciliation and compromise . second , a potent force of political islam may now be hijacked by passions , wrath , and a sense of victimization ; but it will inevitably choose to participate in domestic politics through organized structures and processes . finally , despite egypt ’s significant demographic and economic transitions over the past four decades , egyptian society still retains its agrarian character , which favors conciliation and compromise .
powerful states like china and russia are not limiting themselves to authoritarian rule at home ; they are also supporting those in other countries engaged in similar practices . south africa was one of the most peaceful transitions in history to a multi-racial democracy in the early 1990s , and has been a further advance for rights . yet the past decade of the twentieth century was also indelibly indelibly stained by the ethnic cleansing of ex-yugoslavia and the genocide in rwanda ; and , during the current decade , the tide has seemed to turn against the rights cause . the same is true of lesser powers like iran and venezuela . a factor that contributed to their demise was a shift in thinking that transformed conflict between east and west away from one that emphasized economic systems over the eu was the contrast between totalitarianism and respect for rights , which utterly discredited oppressive regimes tied to moscow and helped precipitate them .
this is one reason why the current confrontation between america and china has raised fears of serious damage , particularly if it leads to ever-greater protectionism and the wider “ trade war . ” if it is not , they risk arising from lower levels of growth and welfare . supply chains now can have as many significant international links as homegrown ones , and a substantial share of total internal demand is being encountered in products partly or wholly produced abroad . as technological innovation further reduces entry bottlenecks for both producers and consumers , proliferation of these linkages become even easier , amplifying what has already been viewed as credible . for the longer-term health of both individual participants and the wider system , these relationships must function effectively , rooted in a cooperative approach that is perceived as credible .
if britain insists on pursuing a purist definition of sovereignty , it will have to agree with which the economic bloc is to align and then accept that the bloc ’s rules . this is not about the question of sovereignty , or of satrapy , but it is about the rule of law . if britain insists on pursuing a purist definition of sovereignty , it will need to agree with which the economic bloc will want to align itself , and then accept that the bloc ’s rules . if britain insists on pursuing a purist definition of its sovereignty , it will need to agree with which the economic bloc is to align , and then accept that the bloc ’s rules .
the gamble has been that a solid , durable recovery would allow banks and households to rebuild their balance sheets fast enough to avoid the need for additional bailouts . in the us , which has the most progressive income tax among the major economies , federal tax reforms that would lower rates and broaden the base are being discussed . deleveraging from governments , financial institutions , and households is one major cause of the sluggish economic recovery . in europe , structural reforms targeting higher retirement ages and labor-market flexibility are the most important causes of the sluggish economic recovery . but sluggish growth implies fewer tax revenues and more demands for payments to cushion hardship , deploy pressure on government budgets .
yet dahrendorf was adamant that the npd ’s destiny should be decided by voters rather than courts that proclaimed the communist party that had been illegal . kaul reiterated this idea in a passionate statement ( which was , no doubt , agreed upon in advance by east german leaders ) about excluding west germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s communists from debate . bucerius then the interjected that thadden ’s sister was an outspoken member of the resistance . thadden himself , however , avoided granting himself a direct answer , suggesting that he would not fight alongside his sister . kaul reiterated this idea in a passionate statement ( which was unquestionably agreed upon in advance by east german leaders ) about excluding west germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s communists from debate .
though financing for public infrastructure has returned to 2008 levels , little is being funneled into new projects . most funds have targeted existing infrastructure , investment that is thought to be relatively safe , because they entail little or no construction risk , and they have proven their potential to generate stable cash yields . in order to overcome obstacles to investment , we design an asset class that we now call “ the buy-and-hold of equity ” ( bhe ) . that asset class would all sit between traditional equity and debt , with the ability of investors to hold it to account for 15 years or even longer . liquidity remains limited in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis , a legacy that includes a non-profit regulatory regime , and has demonstrated its potential to generate stable cash yields .
washington , dc – belarusian president alexander lukashenko is a master of political survival . lukashenko was forced by the removal of russian oil-price subsidies in 2009 to beg , borrow , or to steal enough funds to keep belarus ’s economy out of depression . he looted the international monetary fund into extending a $ 3.4 billion loan , promising freer elections in december 2010 , only to burn that bridge with a brutal crackdown when faced with the adverse electoral results and the biggest protests that his regime has ever seen . now russia has taken the harder line , demanding a heavy price for imf loans , which is in any case insufficient to rescue the regime . but , following the recently concluded 64 % depreciation of the currency , the clock appears to be running out of its prolonged misrule .
indeed , it has become increasingly clear , however , for anyone with persistence and a modicum of computer skill , the internet leaks like the sieve . in its current fight with google , for example , china ’s government seems to think that its technologists can provide the means to keep out old-fashioned thought control . but liu ’s jailing also demonstrates starkest terms that china ’s neglect of its human rights is pouring into the rest of the world alongside its massacres of chinese goods . indeed , it has become increasingly evident that china has opened its economy only to sustain the country ’s over-mighty rulers in power , rather than to respect and enhance ordinary chinese ’s lives . great advances in china ’s economy over the last 30 years are something all chinese celebrate .
at the world economic forum in davos in january , liu he , too , remarked that “ strengthening the party ’s overall leadership is the core issue . ” given these mounting concerns , the implementation risks are now being presented in very different light . these views are not coming out of thin air , but neither . at the world economic forum in davos in january , liu he , too , remarked that “ strengthening the party ’s overall leadership is the core issue . ” liu , a master tactician , seems underscoring the link between management power and the pace of reform .
a wide socioeconomic disparity exists between european populations and roma , or “ gypsies ” – many of whom live in extreme poverty . the situations of the 7-9 million roma living across the continent deserve the pressing attention of government leaders as they shape the policies of the enlarged eu . left unchanged , this persistent poverty threatens to become a permanent drag on european prosperity that would be a tragedy for the roma and non-roma alike . the predicament of the 7-9 million roma living on the continent deserves the urgent attention of government leaders as they shape the policies of the enlarged eu . roma are the continent ’s fastest-growing and most vulnerable minority .
on the political front , the crucial lesson is that it is up to the government to ensure order and safety . it need not be this way , however . in order to help find a solution , we have pest ( political , economic , cultural , and technological ) analysis in hong kong ’s current predicament and future prospects . within a “ one country with two systems ” frameworks , hong kong ’s own government has powers to address the internal security issues . but where its actions are deficient , it is the right and the responsibility of china ’s central government to intervene .
and this could mark the beginning of the slow process of europe ’s disintegration . above all , it needs a program of ideas on research and development , on education and social inclusion , that could appeal to large parts of the population across member states . what is needed , above all , is a program of ideas on research and development , on education , and on social inclusion that could appeal to large swaths of the population across the eu . the european parliamentary election , for example , is less than four months away . pro-european forces need campaigning for a coordinated effort to counter the cyclical slowdown , and – most important – for a cohesive , aggressive policy aimed at addressing europe ’s long-term structural problems .
when asked whether america was prepared to become the world of the second-largest economy , it was deeply reticent . their reaction was understandable : even entertaining the possibility that america will become “ count two ” total career suicide for an american politician . over time , intellectuals have an uncanny duty to think the unthinkable , and to speak the unspeakable . they are meant to view every opportunity , even disagreeable ones , and to prepare the populations for prospective developments . elected officials everywhere must adjust , to varying degrees , to fulfill the expectations of those who put them in office .
mexico city – the current era of innovation , in which cutting-edge technologies disrupt entire economic sectors at a breathtaking rate , has long been dubbed the fourth industrial revolution . it is also the theme of the world economic forum ’s annual meeting this week in davos , switzerland , and rightly so . to maximize the benefits , we must take steps now to prepare our economies and societies , with a focus on three key areas : education , the business environment , and connectivity . in the years ahead , the scale and pace of innovation will transform how we produce , redistribute , and consume . human capital is vitally important to the economy ’s success , and mexico is no exception .
and landlords pay a 15 % tax on their rents , whereas unskilled workers pay a 23 % tax on their meager incomes . in fact , italy ’s tax system is skewed in its favor of the savers . a 12.5 % tax is being levied on capital gains from government bonds , while entrepreneurs risk expanding , innovate , and become more competitive , bolstering job creation and economic growth might require reducing rents further . a 12.5 % tax , for example , would enable small business-owners and entrepreneurial owners to expand , innovate , and becoming more competitive , restoring , roughly 50 % of their startup costs in taxes . and landlords pay a 15 % tax on their rents , whereas unskilled workers pay a 23 % tax on their meager incomes .
current polls show that pis ’s popularity has risen to around 40 % – more than twice that of even a previous ruling party , civic platform . and , though thousands – perhaps tens of thousands , perhaps tens of thousands , of protestors have gathered outside the polish supreme court in recent weeks , some eight million votes for the pis voted in the 2015 elections . accordingly , pis chairman jarosław kaczyński may now declare that his party commands the most public support , and that the ecj will most likely not be keen to step in over time . this suggests that while poles might not agree with pis ’s own judicial reforms , they are not keen to gamble very much on free courts or liberal-democratic principles generally . kaczyński knows full well that his party commands the most public support , and that the ecj will most likely not be in time .
tim thought that … hank took a different view , ” ” ” ” and so on , as if the three musk had interviewed the oral historian . major interests do not seem to be as much in narrative chapters covering the same ground as their past books , just as they do in their policy recommendations for the future . there is also some routine praise for the two presidents they have worked with , george w. bush and barack obama , and a reprise of their frustrations with those who did not see the world the way , and constraining their solutions , like sheila bair of the us federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) and various pesky members of congress . they are noteworthy that they could achieve consensus on fairly radical agendas . three proposals in particular should empower policymakers in the united states and elsewhere to think hard .
in fact , sentiment toward trump is even more unfavorable in western europe . in germany , only 6 % of respondents believe that trump is qualified to hold his current house in may , and 91 % regard him as arrogant . similarly , 89 % of respondents in the united kingdom believe that trump is an arrogant state , and only 50 % still believe that the us and the uk have a special relationship now to keep him in office . this may help to explain why trump ’s scheduled nation visit to the uk has stalled indefinitely . the countries where trump has the most widespread support are poland ( 73 % see america favorably ) , and hungary ( 63 % ) , both of which are led by populist right-wing governments .
conventional wisdom always held that a state with the largest military prevails , but in an age of information that could become the state ( or non-state ) with the best story that wins . in the sixteenth century , control of colonies and gold bullion gave spain the edge ; seventeenth-century holland profited from trade and finance ; eighteenth-century france gained from its larger population and its armies ; and nineteenth-century british power rested on its industrial primacy and its navy . shortly thereafter , us secretary of state hillary clinton declared , “ america can not fix the most pressing problems on our own , and the world can not resolve them without america . ” shortly thereafter , us secretary of state hillary clinton declared , “ america can not fix the most pressing problems on our own , and the world can not resolve them without america . ” today , it is far from clear how the balance of power is measured , far less how to develop successful strategies for survival .
the truth , of course , is that authoritarian systems , whatever their short-term successes in holding the line against irresponsible policies , become unsustainable in the long run . a lack of accountability inevitably produces corruption and inefficiency , the problems with which china is now wrestling . more recently , german finance minister wolfgang schäuble is exposing controversy when , evidently drawing inspiration from that experience , he declared that “ france will be glad if one can force parliament on reform . ” the public consensus supports difficult reforms in eastern europe in the 1990s demonstrates that voters are perfectly able to understand and accept the tradeoffs when there is no perceived alternative . the challenge for democracies is to devise mechanisms that enable them to determine policies that are sustainable in the long run while legitimating the democratic process itself .
my father realized that he could not go it alone and that he needed better access to financing . my father realized that he could not go it alone and that he needed better access to financing . he turned to the university of nebraska , where he had received his undergraduate degree and acquired the hybrid maize and other improved seeds that the university of pittsburgh was developing . he had to stay in nebraska , helped my grandfather to save family farm by the banks that had already repossessed one-third of the land . he had to stay in nebraska , helped my grandfather to save the family farm from the banks that had already repossessed one-third of the land .
second , europe must take the lead in the responsible exploitation of its resources , becoming a truly circular economy , which minimizes the waste . just 0.6 billion tons last year , a mere 7.5 % , originate in recycling . just 0.6 billion tons of energy are currently processed into energy , or produce annually in the eu . this means making europe , alongside our auto industry , the first electric-vehicle continent only by 2030 . and it means making europe , along with our auto industry , first an electric-vehicle continent by 2030 .
recognizing this trend , the world economic forum ’s global agenda council has brought a group of experts and practitioners to help infuse substance into america ’s foreign-policy debates leading up to america ’s election , including by preparing a public debate paper . the key to success will be america ’s capacity to retain the best – and to abandon the worst – of that most american of belief : exceptionalism . from my perspective as the one european country , the overarching message should be that america must conceive of itself , not as “ the indispensable power , ” as it now does , but as its “ the indispensable partner . ” but the payoff , for both america and the liberal world order that it created , would be substantial . this is not simply a matter of semantics ; such change will require america to re-learn its role in the world .
but the late angus maddison ’s estimates of historic gdp per capita suggest that china ’s economic “ retardation ” began well before its encounters with the west . xiang argues that china ’s recent economic rise is simply the “ restoration ” of the success that the country enjoyed prior to nineteenth-century western intrusions has eroded its harmonious system . from 1,500 in 1980 to 1870 , per capita income barely migrated out of $ 600 , while the uk ’s quadrupled ( from $ 714 in total to $ 3,190 ) , and even spain ’s was doubling . china ’s political stability , and the relative absence of violence , was thus achieved at the expense of economic dynamism , not in harmony with it . outsiders misread this system , “ built on a clearly defined scheme , ” as xiang describes it , with “ blood-line royal legitimacy at the top ” and “ scholar gentry to administer state affairs ” as a recipe for stagnation .
this principle of regional solidarity extends to morocco ’s deployment of military hospitals , not only in mali , but also in other conflict zones , such as one in jordan that serves syrian refugees as well . moreover , morocco is a loyal , longstanding us ally . its political stability , open economies , and balanced international relations are increasingly aligned with america ’s regional interests in the world as well . making matters worse , the west would do well to begin cultivating a natural partner in such a troubled region . morocco is well positioned to foster security and development across northwestern africa and beyond .
as i grow older , i am no longer sure why this is so important , but the male members of our own species seem to think that it is . the issue of members of women ’s faculty , particularly in the basic sciences , is far more complicated . i suspect that here the problem reflects a fundamental disparity between the way women and their men ’s approach to science as a microcosm of life . a majority of members of my fellow female faculty are no muscle-bound , testosterone-driven type ; but in their scientific careers , they show two types of typically male behavior . the first is the compulsion to be the first to establish totally trivial facts about science .
so far , syria ’s authorities have not reacted to the tharwa project . but the project appears to represent the kind of activity that can help produce visions for change . this , together with the prominence of the consultative council ( which comprises the well-known egyptian sociologist saad eddin ibrahim , french expert of political islam gilles kepel , and flynt leverett , the brookings institution fellow ) , and the sensitivity of minority rights in general , combined to give the project national , regional , and international notice . some in the syrian government could well be mindful of this . it is still too early in a game for that .
that growth reflects the flawed economic model of the pre-crisis years , which relied on indifference to where growth originated , how sustainable it was , and who benefited most from it . every new bilateral deal , every chapter in globalization , should be measured against new criteria . what how sustainable , and how evenly , will there be profound benefits to those who become economically displaced ? will they facilitate genuine development and provide dignified opportunities to those who become economically displaced ? how sustainable , and to what extent they are supposed to be spreading will require beginning to ask the right questions .
cambridge – in a euphoric moment following the collapse of the soviet union , few would have guessed that ukraine – an industrialized country with an educated labor force and vast natural resources – would suffer stagnation for the next 28 years . neighboring poland , which became poorer than ukraine in 1991 , has managed almost to triple its per capita gdp ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) over the next three decades . and that shift would have occurred at a time of mounting challenge for us interests elsewhere around the world . the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
why should emerging-market countries ’ central banks commit this odd financial intermediation – which represent the main costs – already say , as private money yields are higher than they hold down reserves ? why should emerging-market countries ’ central banks make this odd financial intermediation , which represent a major cost , because the capital ’s yield is greater than that of their reserves ? certainly , these countries can resist excessive upward pressure on their currencies by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves as they did in the past few years . admittedly , the result is all the more paradoxical : private funds that flow to these countries are recycled to u.s. treasury securities through investment of accumulated reserves . here currency appreciation has already happened , pushed there by massive capital inflows since the second quarter of 2009 and can already be said to be excessive ( for example , in brazil ) .
that had made the crisis more severe than any of them since the end of world war ii . central banks had to inject unprecedented amounts of money and extend credit on an unprecedented number of securities into a broader range of institutions than ever before . the last blow came when interbank lending , at the heart of the financial system , was impaired because banks had to husband their resources and could not trust their counterparties . the asset-backed commercial paper market came to a standstill , and the special investment vehicles set out by banks to get mortgages out of their balance sheets could no longer get outside financing . credit expansion must now follow a period of contraction , because some of the new credit tools and practices are unsound and unsustainable .
trump ’s greatest challenge is that the other signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal , officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) , from which he withdrew the united states , remain committed to the deal . the european signatories have established a specific mechanism to facilitate trade and entrepreneurship with iran at the risk of american retaliation , while russia and china have scaled up economic and strategic ties with the islamic republic , marking the first time in the western alliance ’s history that america ’s ’s european allies have joined forces with its rivals . likewise , britain , france , germany , sweden , russia , and china have opposed trump by imposing crippling economic sanctions on iran . they are committed to preserving the agreement and doing everything possible to persuade iran ’s leaders to continue to adhere to it . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
an effective solution to this problem exists : solar-power technology . according to the african progress panel estimates , poor african households would save $ 58 per year , on average , by installing solar panels – the money that they can spend on education , health , and productive investment . in other words , some of the world ’s poorest people pay some of the highest energy prices . of course , firms that provide such panels would benefit enormously from tapping this large new market . an effective solution to this problem exists : solar-power technology .
the richest 10 % of people account for about 50 % of ghg emissions , while the poorest 50 % generate 10 % of their emissions . even the ipcc has included assumptions about such technologies in many of its modeled pathways to keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels . even the ipcc has included assumptions about such technologies in many of its modeled pathways to keep global temperatures from rising at more than 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels . unwilling to confront those who are ravaging our planet , its political leaders have lashed out at technological solutions , including geoengineering approaches that promise to suck already-emitted carbon out of the atmosphere . even the ipcc has included assumptions about such technologies in many of its modeled pathways to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels .
and if growth slows , owing to the higher-cost costs of imported intermediate inputs , the fed can offset that by raising interest rates more slowly . meanwhile , us imports account for 15 % of america ’s gdp , and us imports account for 15 % of america ’s gdp . by contrast , us imports account for 15 % of america ’s gdp ; us imports account for 15 % of america ’s gdp . allowing some substitute away from more expensive imported manufactured goods is the figure that falls under 1 % .
suppose further that the us government gets it right 19 times away from 20 times , when it relies on suspicion of engaging in terrorist activities to revoke people ’s citizenship . the ability to revoke citizenship without presenting any evidence in public is one reason why the us government may prefer this course to arresting and attempting terrorism suspects . and yet simply revoking citizenship does not solve the problem of leaving at large a suspect terrorist who might then carry out an assault elsewhere , unless , like sakr , it kills . had it been the case with those decisions that the uk government made in 2013 , there still seems to be a high probability that an innocent naturalized citizen is becoming stateless . suppose that the us government gets it right 19 times , when it relies on suspicion of engaging in terrorist activities to revoke peoples ’ citizenship .
like the fossil-fuel age , china and india , in particular , should stop building new coal-fired power plants at home , and capital-exporting countries like china and japan should stop funding new coal-fired power plants in the rest of asia , such as pakistan and the philippines . government and business together should finance new research and development in order to drive costs even lower . governments should set limits on emissions , and the private sector should compete to deliver low-cost solutions . like the fossil-fuel age and shut down , china should be replaced with clean-energy generation on the competitive footing , for example via renewable-energy auctions . moreover , china and india , in particular , should stop building new coal-fired power plants at home , and capital-exporting countries like china and japan should cease funding new coal-fired plants in the rest of asia , such as pakistan and the philippines .
what the mikta countries share is rapid economic growth and growing influence beyond their own borders . they have development problems , but so , too , are models of economic dynamism and innovation with a substantial stake in how post-wwii global institutions and rules are supposed to undermine . the bottom line , although this is that russia ’s upcoming absence from the multilateral scene will serve as a catalyst for fresh thinking about global challenges . in an alphabet soup of international politics , a nine-member jawbreaker like bicsmikta might ultimately prove too unwieldy to be workable . many of their challenges and dovetail ambitions with those of the api ( the brics , minus russia ) .
other components of that stimulus went to individuals , but , owing to the nature of the fiscal package , increased transfers and expenditure added more to the national debt rather than to gdp . it was too small to close the output gap that left the continuous upward pressure on demand . when the fed saw how weak the upturn remained , it initiated the strategy of “ unconventional monetary policy , ” ” ” ” ” ” combining large-scale purchases of long-term securities ( quantitative easing ) with its promises to keep the short-term federal funds rate extraordinarily low for an extended period . the objective was to encourage portfolio investors to shift to equities and other assets , with the resulting run-up in their prices putting pressure on household wealth and consumer spending . much of the “ stimulus ” simply financed increased spending by state governments , which would pay for other ways .
public rejection of the euro in the september 2000 referendum hinged on the failure of europe ’s ’s ’s supporters to explain the difference between that unchallenged policy and full euro participation . as a result , denmark may be the last to vote , but not necessarily to join . as a result , denmark may be the last to vote , but not necessarily join . indeed , danish voters saw most of the benefits of euro membership already in the eu , owing to the danish krone ’s unchanged link first to the dm , then to europe ’s , over the last 15 years . in denmark , my own country , economic readiness is not the issue .
but there is little reason why international efforts to ensure north korea ’s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed on bringing about domestic reform . conservatives in both the united states and south korea may argue that north korea must move toward denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change . to be sure , north korea ’s regime is not the only obstacles to international engagement , either . one must not assume that those goals can not be pursued in the same way . on the other hand , winning north korea ’s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change may be impossible .
at the heart of europe ’s political crisis is the eurozone ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic and financial malaise , to which neither national governments nor eu institutions seem capable of addressing it . rather than reinforcing pan-european solidarity , economic hardship has led to massive distributional conflicts . the mutual mistrust that characterizes this conflict can irreparably damage both the soul of the union and the european project . and no one should question that the front and its voters mean what they are saying . at the heart of europe ’s political crisis is the eurozone ’s economic and financial malaise that neither national governments nor eu institutions seem capable of addressing .
unless its competitors take extraordinary , extraordinarily costly steps -- like those taken by microsoft against college cape , its rival online browser market , by pouring a fortune into creating its internet explorer and then distributing it in free itself – the first firm to establish a dominant market position will sustaining high returns as long as its industry lasts . in the section of a “ new economy , ” dominated by manufacturers ’ economies of scale , and consumer economies of scope , a firm that sets the way to successful the market share gains a near-overwhelming benefit . what the bigger the market , the larger the cost advantage . the version with the largest of a market share becomes the norm ; it is the simplest that can figure out how to use , the easiest to find support for , and one that is working best with other goods ( which , of course , is designed to work the best with one ) . moreover , information-produced goods are also becoming more valuable for consumers .
that is why its member states must take the lead in proposing solutions . establishing safe , legal pathways for refugees to europe is one of the most urgent priorities . such a system would protect migrants and protect europe ( by enabling them to vet applicants fully ) . but the eu should be more systematically generous in determining how many to admit and implement organized ways to facilitate its entry . this does not imply that every vulnerable migrant must be accepted .
in recent years , american politics and policy institutions have become more polarized than the distribution of views among the american public to suggest . as an editorial in the economist recently concluded , “ america ’s political system was designed to make laws at the federal level more difficult , not easy . ” citizens ’ behavior seems not to have changed nearly as dramatically as have their answers to poll questions . three-quarters of americans feel connected to their communities , and say that the quality of life there is excellent or good ; 40 % said they work with others in their respective communities is the single most important that they can do . the situation was aggravated by the post-2008 great recession .
new york – history at any moment can be understood as a snapshot , telling us where we are , or as a moving picture , telling us not only where we are but where we were , and where we might be , and where we might be headed . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . it is a distinction between the enormous difference , and it could be made available . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
for example , shenzhen ’s urban air mobility ( uam ) project that provides on-demand helicopter transportation leverages the city ’s well-known innovative capacity , while addressing congestion . in turn , innovation can drive pollution abatement . awareness of this is the third pillar of the strategies to address air pollution . this does not necessarily mean inundating people with news stories of global environmental devastation ; on the contrary , that approach can result in desensitization . moreover , innovation can drive pollution abatement goals , at least in part .
a saudi protectorate may be the key to achieving this . after some years of such a saudi protectorate over the palestinians , serious negotiations – more or less based on crown prince abdullah ’s proposals for a general agreement – could return . perhaps , but so far , conventional solutions have proved anything but disastrous . in the meantime , the most urgent priority is a process of de-escalation , stabilization , and political consolidation within palestinian society . everything else having already failed , that may be the only choice left for both israelis and palestinians .
first , the european financial stability facility must serve to rescue the banking system in the same way that member states do . bringing the banking system under european supervision , rather than abandoning it in the hands of national authorities , would be a fundamental improvement that would help to restore confidence . and it would have the added merit of enlightening the german public about the true purpose of relief operations . despite this added task , the magnitude of the rescue package could remain the same , since any amount used to recapitalize or liquidating banks reduces the size needed by governments . this would make it possible for the sovereign-debt crisis to be restructured without precipitating a banking crisis .
conversely , at the beginning , may be able to galvanize many alienated young voters against a government that has earned wary respect but is not much liked . second , with no effective and responsible opposition , governments may become arrogant , careless , and overly oriented toward their own supporters . in this scenario , the leaders of the far-right conservative party , it seems , may be thinking that they can hollow out with offering disciplined support to prime minister david cameron and his policies , because labour may never win under corbyn , anyway . third , at some point over the next year , the uk will face a referendum over its membership in the european union . while nobody knows the positions corbyn will take on this issue , one may speculate that she , like some trade-union bosses backing it , might decide that the eu is the “ rich ” club , thereby precluding a much-needed cross-party consensus in favor of continued eu membership .
the american government felt it had a weak hand in this way because it was not ready to allow aig to default on either of its liabilities . after the government ’s infusion of funds in september 2008 , aig had continued to mount aig , so the government provided substantial amounts of additional capital two months later . the bailout introduced aig large losses on the derivative transactions with financial institutions , mostly sophisticated players like goldman sachs and spain ’s banco santander . at that point , the government asked aig ’s derivative counterparties to take a voluntary “ haircut ” – that is , accepting the discount on the amounts owed to it . when some of these parties declined , the government backed down and financed aig to pay all of its derivative obligations in full .
at last , the world must recognize that the hopes stirred by the 1990 ’s peace process have been totally dashed . israel will feel free to retaliate for cross-border attacks and to continue rocket fire at within the country ’s civilian targets . in some ways , hamas ’s military coup is making things much clearer . israel has long since decided that it has little interest in renewing its control over the gaza strip . gaza is ruled by a totally hostile regime .
starting in the late 1970s , growth started to slow in many advanced western economies , and american president ronald reagan and federal reserve chair alan greenspan ushered in a debt cycle that supercharged activism . the global population grew more than 50 % between 1800 and 1900 , then more than doubled over the subsequent 50 years , with economies growing much faster than during earlier centuries . human lives became markedly more productive as well , and life expectancies rose dramatically . the aberrant period in history is the 100th anniversary or so of america ’s civil war , during which breakthroughs in energy , electrification , telecoms , and transportation fundamentally reshaped societies . human lives became markedly more productive , and life expectancies rose dramatically .
the sadly , the chances that the ldp will reform , or that the dpj develops into a responsible government party in the foreseeable future are slim . the dpj ’s president , ichiro ozawa , who was once serving as ldp secretary general , is an exemplar of this confused legacy . the core of japan ’s political inertia comprises the current pseudo-two-party system comprising the ldp and the dpj , because the parties ’ divisions are in fact devoid of any consistent ideological and policy difference . both parties include conservatives and liberals , defensive hawks , and the doves . the dpj ’s president , ichiro ozawa , who was once serving as ldp secretary general , is an exemplar of this confused legacy .
moreover , labour party leader jeremy corbyn , a hardline socialist and closet brexiteer , insists on leading such a government . that would have required conservative rebels , opposition liberal democrats , and also mps who quit labour in a protest over corbyn ’s leadership to rally behind it , a tall order . a motley crew of rebels also would have to support the creation of a caretaker government that seeks brexit , calling the snap general election , and possibly legislate the second referendum as well . moreover , labour party leader jeremy corbyn , a hardline socialist and closet brexiteer , insists on leading such a government . but bringing down the government would be inadequate to stem a no-deal brexit .
these proceeds should therefore be taxed in the us . curiously , the irs is choosing not to enforce apple ’s ’s obligation to pay taxes on its us-sourced ip profits . asi ’s profit stem from apple ’s intellectual property ( ip ) rights , which are based entirely on research and development in the us ( much of it replaced by federal government financing ) . such profits should therefore be taxed with respect to the american economy . instead , apple charge asi a symbolic levy to allow it to profit from apple ’s us-sourced ip rights , for whom it pays a miniscule tax to the irs .
this gives confrontational politicians a powerful advantage and produces the electoral polarization upon which the pekos have fed . starkly antagonistic pronouncements and positions are prone to gaining the most exposure . each has achieved ( or maintained ) power through having polarizing their societies , and is mobilizing their electoral base . the pekos ’s political style has been enabled by modern news media , which , scrambling for audiences sharing , simplify , and sensationalize issues . this political strategy has undoubtedly been effective .
during this summer , britons had their say on whether they wanted gene-spliced , or as genetically modified ( gm ) , goods in their field , and food . to gauge public opinion in advance of a decision scheduled for later this year on whether to permit commercial gm crop planting , a british government sponsored ( at great expense ) constitutes a series of public debates around the country . local governments and other organizations have held hundreds of additional public meetings . the head of the british debates ’ web assembly , professor malcolm grant , has been referred to as “ a unique experiment to discover what ordinary people really think once they ’ve heard all arguments . ” this suggestion may be amusing a child , but there is nothing amusing when governments apply it , how they increasingly do , to complex policies involving science and technology .
in fact , the kremlin is financing many of these parties still . there are other kremlin supporters just as well , including corporate leaders who want to return to business as usual with russia , and academic apologists for the soviet union , who , 25 years after its collapse , see a chance of vindication . lenin once said that capitalists sell the ropes . today , european governments appear willing to let putin buy votes with which he demolishes the eu . and , with public-opinion polls revealing that a substantial minority of europeans are falling in line with putin ’s rhetoric , his strategy of dividing the eu and nato appears to make genuine headway .
improper agriculture practices also blame : the liberal use of synthetic fertilizer , for example , decimates organisms inhabiting land and reverses their structures . moreover , according to the world bank estimate , 10-30 % of arable land worldwide – a land that would be used by millions of smallholders , pastoralists , and indigenous peoples – has suffered from large-scale investment . in germany itself , construction projects assertion an average of more than 75 hectares a day – over the last 15 years – an average of more than 75 hectares of arable land . at the same time , global demand for food , fodder , and biomass for fuels is growing , in turn driving the value of land – a reality that has not escaped international investors ’ attention . it takes millennia for fertile topsoil to form ; in many places , the cloudburst is now all it takes to wash it away .
the iranian regime is far too astute to cross any of these red lines . an american war against iran is indeed plausible only as a response to a blatant and imminent iranian contest over vital american interests , such as a major terrorist attack , an invasion of an ally in the gulf , or a disruption of the free flow of middle eastern oil to the west . iran , like north korea , will continue its test of obama ’s capacity to build up its international alliances aimed at unleashing the american economy . that is an odd idea , given that today ’s two continuing wars have only compounded the american economy ’s vulnerabilities . convinced that us history will judge the president by his success in containing the iranian threat , broder also predicts that a major war with iran would re-ignite the american economy .
while germany ’s president is not supposed to intervene in the country ’s day-to-day governance , its vote will undoubtedly be influential . in brazil and elsewhere , the imf ’s distorted accounting frameworks ­ – what it does and does not count as expenditures – continue to inhibit the investments required to modernize public-sector enterprises , and introduce a sizeable roadblock in the form of land reform . the imf ’s economic framework still makes no provision for countercyclical fiscal policies because the imf remains ambivalent about the standard keynesian prescription of stimulating the economy in a downturn . it is here that germany should take the pause and look at the record . for example , when the government borrows to buy the land , it treats its debts as collateral , but an offsetting transaction if selling the land through a mortgage effectively goes unrecognized .
washington , dc – donald trump has been officially inaugurated as us president , but questions of russia ’s election interference will not go away . yet one key question often seems lost in the fray : why did russian president vladimir putin do so ? in our view , america ’s intelligence agencies ’ concluding that , by aiding trump , the kremlin was advancing their “ longstanding desire to undermine the us-led liberal democratic order is not an entirely convincing scenario . ” to be sure , it ’s not hard to guess why putin has favored trump by his opponent , former secretary of state hillary clinton . yet one key question often seems lost in the fray : why has russian president vladimir putin done just that ?
moreover , the country is projected to grow at an 8-8.5 % rate in the coming fiscal year . it is fair to say that the usually staid statistics department has stole the thunder from this year ’s budget . nonetheless , finance minister arun jaitley ’s budget has succeeds on several fronts , not least in its convergence of vision and implementation . specifically , it advances the government ’s vision of a pro-growth agenda that enhances the ease with which business in india while targeting improved delivery mechanisms for welfare schemes . no budget change could generate such a label , costing free acceleration of growth .
but it has also followed a conciliatory diplomatic policy toward britain and the us , spending substantial resources to make itself attractive overseas . following the failures of its imperialist greater east asia co-prosperity scheme of the 1930 ’s ( which possessed a soft-power component of anti-european propaganda ) and its defeat in world war ii , japan has turned to a strategy that minimized military power and relied on strategic alliances with america . japan ’s single-minded focus on economic growth has achieved its goal , but the country has developed only modestly faster military and soft power . in its early decades , communist china based its military strength on the 1930 ’s ( which had the soft-power component of anti-european propaganda ) and its defeat in world war ii , japan has turned toward a strategy that minimized military power , relying on strategic alliances with america . but , following the depletion of its maoist strategy in the 1970s , chinese leaders switched to market mechanisms to foster economic development .
xi ’s anti-corruption campaign has gone as far as it is taking down a retired member of the politburo standing committee , china ’s most powerful body . likewise , carbon-dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically since the beginning of this year , and the authorities appear well on the road to hitting the carbon-intensity target established in 2010 . regulatory reform is starting to mitigate the shadow-banking risks , and even some ghost towns are being consolidated by market forces . at the looming fifth plenum , china ’s leaders must build on this progress , agreeing to stay out of reform momentum . regulatory reform is starting to mitigate the shadow-banking risks , and even some ghost towns are locked up by market forces .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
this method of governance makes it appear that at long last we can hold policymakers accountable by setting whether the targets were reached or not . in keeping with the spirit of the times , governments are introducing business criteria to measure efficiency -- and to `` success , '' more generally -- of public services . this means , first and foremost , that they are setting performance targets . this method of governance makes it appear that at long last we can hold policymakers accountable by setting whether the targets were reached or not . so the council of ministers proclaim that the street crime will be halved next spring or that the rate of any generation will pick up to 50 % in five years .
peru ’s president alejandro toledo invented a new extreme sport , a soccer game in which he was sole player . toledo argued that he would send all dishonest officials to jail – words that captured the imagination of peruvians , who yearned to see criminal politicians brought to justice . instead of kicking the ball to victory , he aims in a way that caused his opposition scores . this helps to explain why with more than half of his term left , the man who ran a popular movement to unseat former president alberto fujimori holds an only 7 % popularity rating today – the lowest ranking of any peruvian leader since 1980 when democracy was re-established . toledo assumed the presidency planning to dismantle the corruption that marked fujimori ’s administrations and ended the reign of his crooked intelligence chief , vladimiro montesinos .
a mistake in the us presidential debate may turn the tide of public opinion overnight , as happened to president gerald ford in his debate with jimmy carter in 1976 . conversely , ronald reagan ’s performance in his 1980 debate with carter is often credited by his victory . another event that could turn the tables would be an “ october surprise , ” linked to terrorism , which could shift the agenda from a financial crisis back to a security administration , republican leaders ’ stronger suit . shortly before the election , osama bin laden released a video tape that may have helped president bush defeat senator john kerry . from bin laden ’s perspective , bush ’s policies were more useful to his effort to recruit supporters than kerry might have been .
that search , after all , threatens to divide the nation among the ruling elites . so why not elect a man like lugovoi , who really represents what the elite stands for ? would n’t lugovoi ’s return to politics bring about the ideal solution to the problem of finding the heir to putin ? so why not try a man like lugovoi , who really represents what the elite stands for ? let us compare the two potential presidential candidates , putin in 1999 and lugovoi in 2007 .
the un sustainable development goal of eliminating extreme poverty worldwide by 2030 entirely depends on continued economic growth via trade , technological innovations , and international cooperation . such thinking poses a grave threat to the world of its most vulnerable people . erecting trade barriers , engaging in digital mercantilism , and , more generally , undermining the liberal world order , will severely harm the more extreme poor in africa and other underdeveloped regions , while doing nothing to help the coal miners in west virginia . the powerful will always manage , but the weakness will carry the burden of what is essentially a nostalgic protectionism that erodes the very benefits of globalization . their mythical tribe has been great in some mythical pasts , so why not try to recreate it ?
some argue that it is the state – and , by extension , the communist party of china ( cpc ) – that must retain a prominent role , in order to uphold the social stability needed to sustain economic development . moreover , the chinese state has been integral to coordination problems that are neither susceptible nor efficiently handled by decentralized markets , particularly in the developing world , where market institutions and administrative capabilities can come at various stages of development . national engagement also needs to be directed to help manage inequality and ensure inclusive growth patterns , from which markets can not be counted on to do on their own . without question , the state has been integral to china ’s development , not only by investing in areas like infrastructure and technology , but also by serving as a backstop as nascent markets and private-sector institutions developed . others argue that spurring the innovations needed to reach high-income status requires the state to become less like a market participant and more like the referees , a regulator and a arbiter of economic and social top priorities .
egypt ’s fiscal deficit , for example , will still surpass 11 % of gdp this year . almost all political players in egypt , as in other arab countries in transition , recognize the need for economic reform . but economic sense does not translate into a policy response that has been painfully slow or non-existent . the government ’s ’s ’s reduction of fuel subsidies last year did not follow the additional reforms , and the required tax increases were delayed soon after president mohamed morsi announced it . but egypt ’s own leaders have stalling the terms of a much-needed international monetary fund loan .
our unicef survey of 126 developing countries found that among the almost one-half that are cut to public expenditures , a common adjustment fund includes public-sector wage cuts or caps , withdrawal of food subsidies , and targeting and rationalizing their already meager social-protection systems . often , such adjustment measures are accepted without being carefully scrutinized by their socioeconomic impact . how many poor chileans will miss out on education because teachers are absent because of low wages , or simply because impoverished children must work to supplement their family incomes ? and yet , in a world where they are in a very best position to do everything , all people will suffer . how many poor children will miss out on education because teachers are absent because of low wages , or simply because poor children must work to supplement their family incomes ?
the first scenario is dismal : germany fails to integrate refugee crises socially and economically ; political discontent surges ; and newcomers have become increasingly frustrated with their plight . indeed , germany ’s ’s future could play out in two ways . the world has a big stake in which scenario prevails . the first scenario is bleak : germany fails to integrate refugees socially and economically ; political discontent surges ; and newcomers have become increasingly frustrated with their plight . any steps they take to frighten that frustration embolden right-wing populists and could lead to violence from both sides .
what is clear is that the interest in a “ military as institution ” depends on the military ’s capacity to establish far greater separation from the regime . successful political transitions also help , if more and more citizens come to feel that they have “ own ” the protests and the consequent transition . at this point , the democratic transition will most likely require that the army play a more active role in protecting the protesters . by contrast , the army ’s decision to allow mubarak loyalists – some riding camels or cohorts – to take charge in cairo ’s tahrir square and attacking thousands of anti-government demonstrators was the classic “ army as the government for which the government is moving . ” what is clear is that the interest of a “ military as an institution ” depends on the military ’s capacity to establish far greater separation from the regime .
given america ’s unwillingness to join the icc ( or to bring its own torturers to justice in america ’s courts ) , such a role would have been vulnerable to both international and domestic political attacks . at the same time , obviously , they would work in close cooperation with the ugandan forces . yet does the operation of uganda , following so closely on the libya intervention , herald a police role for america whenever the un or the icc , which , lacking its own police forces , rely on its members , and cross-national cooperation – the judges that it needs ? some doubt that american policymakers have become increasingly receptive to the international criminal court ’s potential to undergird the terms of a new form of global engagement . yet the extent of american cooperation with the icc has thus far exceeded even the constructive role the obama administration proposed .
one poll found that 19 % of americans believe that their incomes were putting them in the top 1 % of the income distribution – and that up to 20 % , more hope of reaching the top 1 % someday . these are not the beliefs conducive to social democracy , but they are the result of these . so why are n’t americans feeling more alarm about their country ’s rising income inequality ? part of the reason for not doing so is that most americans fail to recognize what is happening . deep in the middle of american ideology and culture is a constellation of beliefs and attitudes : belief that the future will be brighter than the present ; that what you accomplish with your own hands ; that individuals should rely on themselves , not the state ; that people can cross the oceans and the mountains to create for themselves a better life ; and that those who succeed have succeeded in doing so not through luck and corruption but through preparation and industry .
stockholm – our generation has a unique opportunity . they emerged from the largest summit in the un ’s history , the “ rio +20 ” conference in 2012 , followed by the largest consultation that the un has ever conducted . that is the course set by world leaders when they have met at the un in new york on september 25 to adopt the un ’s sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) . if we fix our minds to it , we could be the first in human history to leave our children nothing : no greenhouse-gas reduction , no extreme poverty , and no loss of biodiversity . recognizing this , the 17 goals range from ending poverty and improving health to protecting the planet ’s biosphere , and to providing energy for all .
if an algorithm does n’t do the job of silencing less privileged voices , online trolls often foot in , directing hateful and threatening speech at whomever they choose . accordingly , the wiisiest is often rewarded with a megaphone while less polarizing , less privileged voices are drowned out , even providing the smart , nuanced perspectives that may truly enrich the public debate . victims of online harassment often respond with self-censorship , and many , with their sense of safety and even self-worth peddled , remove itself out of social media altogether . accordingly , the wiisiest german blogger richard gutjahr is often rewarded with a megaphone while less polarizing , less privileged voices are drowned out even as they are delivered through the smart , nuanced perspectives that may actually enrich the public debate . victims of online harassment often respond with self-censorship , and with many , with their sense of safety and even self-worth eroded , remove themselves out of social media entirely .
i single out america not because it is unique in its neglect , but because it is unique in its capacity to lead . yet africans do not vote ; they buy us products ; they do not threaten violence . they are simply poor , hungry , and disease-ridden . indeed , few of the rich world do better than america 's . africans do not vote ; they buy us products ; they do not threaten violence .
this is because krugman refuses to take seriously keynes ’s crucial distinction between risk and uncertainty . hence , after he headed it in 1932 , there can be “ no escaping ” prolonged and perhaps interminable depression , with direct state intervention to promote and subsidize new investment “ ” – something that the obama administration is rightly doing . on the question of what caused the crash , that debate is more even about . krugman is hampered by who attributes the crash to “ irrationality , ” ” which , as cochrane points out , is no theory . keynes , in my opinion , was to emphasize the “ extreme precariousness ” that pertaining to which our estimates of prospective yield have had to be made .
cape town – nowadays , people are all too often left to decide between do what is morally right and do what is economically beneficial . indeed , their possibilities sometimes seem to be mutually exclusive , making decisions about which path to action to take exceedingly challenging . that has been the case – ranging from the perspectives of this archbishop and former finance minister , with the world ’s response to climate change . the moral imperative is incontrovertible , because the effects of climate change – including extreme weather , changes in temperature , and rising sea levels – are felt most briefly by the global poor , who have also benefited the least from the economic activities that it causes . the moral imperative is incontrovertible , because the effects of climate change – including extreme weather , changes in temperature , and rising sea levels – are felt most fast by the global poor , who have also benefited the least from the economic activities that cause it .
hallyday was the child of the generation that watched america ’s gis entering paris , and it was being invented for itself an american own ascendance . he was the consummate artist of the french scene , a chameleon beamed on satellite tv , dripping with fake swedish and true glitz , the artist who , like the novelist , confusingly hopeless that he seemed to condemn him to live at the edges of every form of excess . and then there was the ’60s rocker that his absence seemed like a part of a show , somehow making us forget that he was no longer with us . abiding in each of us was hallyday rocker that was the sights set by the sad wolf and cheekbones hewn by giacometti , a catcher full of rye chinese grese ; his father , a character from modiano , who , between bouts of drinking , pawned gifts granted to him by his son . hallyday was so well lamented that his absence appeared part of a show , somehow making us forget that it was no longer with us .
above all , every advanced economy has pursued policies designed to deliver high wages that would ensure high levels of consumption and thus rapid growth . the keys to that period of growth and happiness have been strong social-welfare systems , and mainly keynesian domestic and foreign economic policies in all big states in the world . of course , it was subject to ups and downs , but it was not subject to financial crises of the type we see regularly . job insecurity back then was , of course , mostly unknown , and mass poverty vanished . it was , of course , subject to ups and downs , but it was not subject to financial crises of the type we see regularly .
but , like de gaulle ’s ’s declaration and may ’s slogan , churchill ’s own statements have employed the language of political ambiguity . the us has an interest , and associated , but not absorbed . that seems to reflect the stance , expressed by cameron and former chancellor of the exchequer george osborne , that helped set the stage for brexit . in the aftermath of the euro crisis , they argued that europe needed more fiscal integration ; but without the uk ; there would be no british financial involvement in future european rescue operations . solidarity ( at least the kind that cost money ) stopped in the english channel .
in this crisis , an american president should form a united front with human-rights groups that can advise him precisely how to follow , sustain , and account for the protestors ’ safety . what the west can accomplish is apply pressure on iran – as well as on other governments in the future – to assure and account for the protesters ’ safety . barack obama says that america is “ stands with respect to those who support the free assembly . ” natan sharansky has said that this tactic – a west monitoring and demanding accountability for the treatment of individual internal dissenters . that will be welcome news to the people living under america ’s dictatorial regimes have installed and propped up by an american-inspired opposition leaders and journalists languishing in us-supported jails in those countries for having engaged just such protest .
russian membership in the world trade organization has the potential to strengthen the rule of law , fight corruption , and give russia a stake in better relations with the outside world . closer ties between russia and the european union make good sense for similar reasons . russia should be treated as a major power , implying consultations on important global issues . there should also be some understanding for what the russian and russian people have gone through the last two decades . losing a country and a special place in the world is the sort of trauma that could fuel the emergence of extreme and potentially violent nationalism .
but a consensus has emerged in brazil that the left party can neither win nor govern with hard-left ideas , nor lula ’s presidency has challenged this view . perhaps most of the opposition , fernando henrique cardoso , the relative achievement of privatization and liberal market economies around the world , and the growth of brazil ’s ’s middle class as well . the consensus may have reflected the successes of lula ’s predecessor , fernando henrique cardoso , the relative accomplishment of privatization and the liberal market economy worldwide , as well as the growth of brazil ’s middle class . whatever the case , for key brazilian left leaders , including rousseff , capitalism has become part of the solution , rather than the core problem . with brazil and its center-left social democratic president , investors are taking every form of risk .
when things can be made , used , broken/charged , and recycled closer to home , the need for transportation diminishes dramatically . my reduced cost will , of course , be someone else ’s ’s ’s ’s reduced revenue – and not only apple ’s . recycled materials do n’t need to be shipped to centralized processing centers , and then forwarded to factories . one big loser in this world will be freight businesses ( along with junkyards , logistics firms , and centralized recycling operations ) . products will not have to be made in those factories and then shipped to customers , or with inventories shipped .
london – in the 1960s , the green revolution – which included the rise of higher-yielding crop varieties , the spread of irrigation infrastructure , and the distribution of advanced fertilizers and pesticides to developing-country farmers – bolstered farming production worldwide . but chronic hunger remains pervasive , especially in developing countries , which suffer the most from crop shortages and food-price volatility . by 2050 , the global human population is expected to surpass nine billion , according to the world bank . to be sure , surmounting these challenges will not be easy . achieving food security means ensuring that all people have the consistent , affordable access to the right kinds of nutrients , despite land and limitations on water , climate change , and the rising prevalence of resource-intensive western-style diets that accompany rising incomes .
europe is to turkey “ the principle of moderation ” and inenticement to remain democratic . in reality , turkey needs europe as much as europe needs turkey . turkey , not the european union , is currently making its presence felt . indeed , for many years , erdoğan ’s domestic critics of erdoğan ’s government have been denouncing what they describe as the regime ’s “ putin-like ” “ putinization ” . but the course of history may very well change quickly .
even so , government expenditures on cancer averages around $ 4 billion per year . experience , on the other hand , indicates that governments often struggle to align public spending with underlying or mounting problems , such as the public-health threats until it reaches the crisis point . more people have died from cancer in america last year alone than they have in fighting . in fact , over the last year , ’s 580,000 cancer deaths exceeded those of roughly 430,000 combat deaths , on average , in world war i , world war ii , the korean war , and the gulf war . that alone stands at more than 0.5 % of america ’s annual military budget of roughly $ 718 billion .
a journalist visiting the kingdom of saudi arabia recently asked me why five out of six students whom he interviewed at king saud ’s university still believe that al qaida is not responsible for reporting on america ’s attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon in america last year ? i was using to believe that denial of saudi complicity in the attacks reflected our discomfort with what happened on that dark day . i had used to believe that denial of saudi complicity in the attacks reflected our discomfort with what happened on that dark day . so far , we are no closer than we were after the assault to answer to that question , because we ca n’t even find the nerve to wonder it is . dealing with this question has become increasingly frustrating for me , because i have run out of plausible explanations .
while tunisia was an extreme case of the regime furthering the economic interests of a small insiders , the pattern has been widespread . moreover , income inequality has widened , with the global phenomenon of increasing concentration of wealth at the top highly pronounced in many arab countries . top incomes in these countries have largely stemmed from political patronage rather than innovation and hard work . this is why the knee-jerk , simplistic “ washington consensus ” prescription of more liberalization and privatization are inappropriate for the arab world in 2012 . top incomes in these countries have stemmed largely from political patronage rather than from innovations and hard work .
but that is no longer the case , either . few countries are more integrated into the postwar order than germany , which , like japan , owes its post-1945 economic resurgence to the rules-based trading system . trump ’s protectionist policies are thus challenging the entire german economic model as he has existed since the 1950s . indeed , trump ’s recent moves are not just about trade , but about america ’s departure from the pax americana itself . germany ’s economy relies heavily on exports , which means that it is acutely vulnerable to the trade bottlenecks and the punitive tariffs imposed by major trade partners .
during macron ’s first five-year term , therefore , he should focus on boosting france ’s gdp growth to an average of at least 2 % per year and reducing the unemployment rate to below 6 % . the simplest way to achieve both goals would be to focus on where france is underperforming relative to other eu countries . part of the challenge for unemployment is tied to the hidden cost . france has some of the eu ’s highest hourly workers , and a natural outcome is tepid hiring . with inequality also increasing , many french are rightly angry that labor is taxed far more than capital gains .
nonetheless , putin ’s approval ratings remain at about 80 % . if low oil prices persist and western economic sanctions remain in place , russia will run out of cash through the end of 2016 . in early december , putin signed the 2015 federal budget , which foresaw 2 % annual gdp growth , and a budget deficit that was amounting to 0.5 % of gdp . but collapsing oil prices , coupled with tough economic sanctions imposed by america and europe , meant that at the end of last month , the us government foresaw 4 % decline in gdp and a budget deficit of 3.5 % of gdp , and that , following budget cuts worth 1 % of gdp . based on these figures , it is estimated that , by the end of this year , russia will be spending up to 70 % of the reserve fund accrued – or so , when oil prices were high .
given that libra will take the form of private money tied to a basket of stable major currencies , how would that work in practice ? a standard “ efficient market ” analysis does not help us answer that question , because in perfect markets such flows , such flows would be the self-correcting argument . if argentina ’s people could shift from pesos to a basket of stable , single-touch currencies , would n’t they then pour into that safe asset at the first hint of trouble in the domestic economy ? as one facebook executive puts it , “ we want to send money to be as easy as to send a text message . ” but , of course , libra is selling as much more .
should bush , bernanke , or new us treasury secretary henri paulson cause investors to lose their faith in american financial assets at some point over time , a rising euro will help shield european interest rates from the effects . recent upward momentum on ten-year german bonds , which might have been expected to go higher because of the deterioration in inflationary expectations during this period , barely recede . the yield on ten-year german bonds that might have been expected to go higher because of the worsening inflationary expectations during this period barely shifted . at the same time , the recently toughled euro helped keep european long-term interest rates — the key determinant of economic activity — as inflationary expectations deteriorated somewhat in the euro-zone periphery . this is a huge plus for sustaining economic recovery , but it could start now .
italy and germany were nineteenth-century amalgamation of a colorful variety of small and medium-size political units . of the six bigger eu member states , only france has a truly well-defined centralized political system . of poland ’s six bigger eu member states , only france has a truly well-defined , centralized political system . the united kingdom resembles a precise counterpart within the political world , but scotland today is governed by a political party that wishes to override the union ’s 1707 act , with a future ready to be labeled by the scottish referendum in 2014 . italy and germany were nineteenth-century amalgamations of a colorful variety of small and medium-size political units . the united kingdom resembles a precise counterpart in the political world to a well-known physical phenomenon of splintering or fissuring .
money , therefore , is a question of trust , without which no society can function . we believe in the banknotes , because we collectively decide to trust the government when it says that 100 is 100 , rather than ten , or 50 . we do n’t grow up wishing to work for crooks and liars . just as we watched our leaders ’ commands to fight and die because we trust their judgment , we entrust our careers and our money to those who run the bank of citigroup and goldman sachs and other such banks , because we believe that their leaders will be fair to their employees and clients , and honorable in their business practices . once that trust breaks , so do the bad things that do .
he created an environment in which demands for radical change led to a compromise , rather than rage , in sharp contrast to , say , the violent breakup of yugoslavia . like francis and sanders , it was an unlikely reformer . despite rise to power with the kgb ’s backing , it did not surrender its thought processes to such a machine , in the ways that president vladimir putin obviously did . likewise , far from curbing the democratic machine ’s mold , sanders is working to pull the party back again “ to the social democratic left where it belongs to ” to the social democratic left . like francis and sanders , gorbachev has been an unlikely reformer .
those in the developing world who believe that a bargaining history has occurred in bad faith have a strong case to do so . unsurprisingly , wealthy countries ’ negotiators dump around large numbers when describing the bargains from even an imperfect agreement . whatever economics , take this route may be tougher today than it has been in the past : with so many developing countries becoming vibrant democracies , electorates can punish governments that embrace what is universally viewed as another unfair trade deal . america ’s agricultural subsidies are going just that way . those in the developing world who believe that a bargaining history has occurred in bad faith are a strong case .
princeton – recently , physicists at the great hadron collider ( lhc ) differ in the world of the most powerful particle accelerator , located near geneva at the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) , announced that the celebrated discovery of the 2012 of the higgs boson was really that of higgs boson . now , the standard model of particle physics is finessed , except for one important thing : the black foot . to be sure , these prophets have been neither first nor the last in their species . four years ago , the doomsayers predicted that the lhc would produce microscopic black holes that had swallow the earth in a matter of months . the latter-day nostradamuses have provoked widespread fear , not to mention lawsuits for the majority of the country ’s high-energy robotic physics experiments .
throughout the democratization process of the 1980s and 1990s , successive governments tried to tame the hyperinflation , which peaked at 2,477 % in 1993 . reintroducing the “ real plan , ” launched in 1994 , has succeeded in restraining annual price growth to an “ acceptable ” 22 % by the subsequent year . over the course of the democratization process of the 1980s and 1990s , successive governments tried to tame the hyperinflation , which peaked at 2,477 % in 1993 . today , as central bankers in the advanced countries fret about the threat of deflation , brazilian policymakers are again being forced to respond to widespread fears of slowing growth and the return to high inflation . monetary policy has long played an important role in brazilian politics .
not surprisingly , the atmosphere at this year ’s world economic forum was grim . those who think that globalization , technology , and a market economy would address the world ’s ’s problems looked subdued . not surprisingly , the atmosphere at this year ’s world economic forum was grim . those who think that globalization , technology , and a market economy would solve the world ’s problems looked subdued . against the backdrop of the subprime crisis , disasters at many financial institutions , and the weakening of the us stock market , these “ masters of the universe ” seem less omniscient than they did in a short time .
the european central bank has provided a heavy volume of emergency “ liquidity ” financing to banks , which they are using to purchase even more government debt . this is holding down interest rates on that debt in the short run but generates even bigger potential losses when a potential default is underway . now , in view of the profound sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone periphery , government defaults are threatening to take down large banks . banks and policy are deeply intertwined in all of the advanced economies , including the us . diamond has discovered that policymakers in the eurozone ’s periphery are deeply intertwined .
even so , brazil has a long way to go . for starters , anemic investment in conventional infrastructure since the 1980 ’s has created an increasingly heavy drag on tfp , contributing to wasting rates and inefficiency in current production systems . this could be addressed by fine-tuning the division of labor in infrastructure investment and governance between the public and private sectors , with crowding targets in the latter . provided that the government continues its commitment to a comprehensive poverty-reduction strategy , including improved access to health care , financial services , and education , brazil ’s overall productivity should improve in the years ahead . indeed , despite low average growth rates , the per capita income of the bottom quintile has grown at more than 6 % annually in the 2000 ’s , owing largely to cost-effective social-welfare policies .
according to the most recent figures running through july or august for most countries , there are “ two-thirds ” countries that recorded the inflation rate above 10 % . in the period after the eruption of the oil shocks of the 1970s until the early 1980s , nearly two-thirds of these countries recorded the inflation rate above 10 % . venezuela ( which did not publish official inflation statistics later this year ) and argentina ( nor did it release reliable inflationary data for a few years ) figure prominently in that group . iran , russia , syria , ukraine , and a few african countries comprise the rest . the share of countries recording outright deflation in consumer prices ( the greece line ) is higher in 2015 than it was experiencing double-digit inflation ( the red line at the same time ) .
overcrowded classes in often lacking physical surroundings with no needed equipment result in ever-prolonged trials , impairment of matter , and much of unhappiness among both students and professors . for the most part , the fast fixes that they impose have done so far have not been hugely successful . in the absence of sufficient resources , one can simply let universities deteriorate . there is , of course , an alternative . in the case of higher education , one can simply let universities deteriorate .
only the bloodshed , the sad to say , can seal such a diplomatic bargain . as a political activist in the final days of yugoslavia , i tried to construct upon the philosophy of un violence , leading demonstrations , and other forms of peaceful forms of dissent . the two million kosovars suffered from milosevic 's rule in each aspect of their lives , from basic safety to education . for years , they tried to express their grievances through peaceful means . kosovo 's need to free itself from milosevic 's grip has been so evident throughout the decade .
likewise , efforts at nation-building along secular lines reflected egyptian president gamal abdel nasser ’s pan-arabism and the syrian ba’ath party , resulting in the establishment of the united arab republic , the union between egypt and syria that lasted from 1958 to 1961 . tunisia adopted its new constitution , on january 27 , thereby clearing the way for what would constitute the most secular and fairest elections in any of the region ’s states . a half-century later , the simultaneous revolts in the arab world stemmed from neither political tendencies , nor reflected in broad popular rejection of dysfunctional and corrupt authoritarian governments . tunisia adopted its new constitution , on january 27 , thereby clearing the way for what would constitute the most secular and fairest elections in any part of the region ’s states . yet , with syria mired in a brutal civil war that claimed more than 130,000 lives , libya on the brink of collapse was its gain , and egypt ’s return to its military and proscribing of the muslim brotherhood , tunisia experienced its only success .
berlin – how we eat in the industrialized world is unhealthy , unjust , and unsustainable . worldwide , an estimated 300 million tons of meat are produced annually , and the united nations food and agriculture organization estimates that the annual total will rise to 455 million tons by 2050 if demand continues to grow at its current pace . so vast amounts of meat can be produced everywhere on an industrial scale and at high social , political , and ecological cost . and now our industrial model for meat production is being exporting to the global south , particularly india and china , where meat consumption has been rising among these countries ’ emerging middle classes . far too many of the flesh that we consume today is being produced under questionable ecological , ethical , and social conditions .
cambridge – for some time now , the four horsemen of america ’s macroeconomic policymaking have been taxation , regulation , commerce and infrastructure . while i considered the latter region in less detail , evidence suggests that regulation is , at best , only a minor contributor to growth . the fourth area exists only so much rhetoric : an infrastructure program currently is not some part of a macroeconomic policy repertoire . having studied the first in detail , i found tax cuts that were a positive contributor to economic growth . the third area matters enormously , which makes trade tensions so worrying today .
but there will come a time when this tailwind subsides and china starts rejoining the so-called frontier of the advanced economies . as gordon observes , long-lasting productivity dividends linked to urbanization have occurred – a trend that could continue for at least another decade in china . chinese policymakers ’ new focus on innovation-led growth seems to recognize this risk . without powerful innovations , sustaining high productivity growth will be an uphill battle . at that point , china will be tackling some of the same productivity challenges confronting america and others .
but the plan was supposed to depress economic activity further , and failed to establish an adequate basis for calculating how much debt restructuring puerto rico will need . the sad truth is that the opportunity for the right of rico ’s fiscal vessel has not been seized . by contrast , the oversight board has recently certified a new fiscal plan and an agreement with holders of bonds issued by puerto rico ’s urgent special-interest fund company ( cofina ) , which may place the island in a debt straitjacket indefinitely . and the cofina deal is itself part of a larger debt-restructuring effort that relies on unrealistic assessments of the commonwealth ’s economic circumstances . at $ 17.8 billion , the stock of cofina bonds ( backed by future sales-tax receipts ) accounts for more than one-third of total debt restructuring by puerto rico .
ten years on , what impact have principles displaced . we have aroused awareness of the plight of the displaced , brought about changes in government policies , and raised billions of dollars in responding to their fundamental need . the achievements are notable , if insufficient . the achievements are notable , if insufficient . humanitarian efforts continue to be strengthened , including through the new swift financing mechanism , the un ’s central-emergency response fund .
andrew carnegie , the wealthiest man of veblen ’s era , was blunt in his moral judgments . wearing a watch that cost 200 times as much as one that does the better job of keeping time says something else , even while worn by people who are not self-governing some relatively poor country . essentially , such a person is said ; “ i am either extraordinarily ignorant or merely plain selfish . ” we can adapt that judgment to a man or a woman who wears the $ 30,000 watch ’s watch , or buying out similar luxury goods , like the $ 12,000 handbag . essentially , such a person is said ; “ i am either extraordinarily ignorant or merely plain selfish .
on the other hand , parfit argued , desires can be irrational . if causes and individuals could easily have been three separate books , on what matter really : the first two volumes were published in 2011 , while the third , in a press when parfit died , had just appeared . in this monumental work , totaling roughly 1,900 pages , parfit challenges the idea – nearly universally assumed by economists , and by many philosophers from david vitter onward , that the role of reason tells us how to get what we want , but not to tell us what to do . he shows that both the “ total , ” and the “ average ” answers , have a paradoxical or counterintuitive implications . in this monumental work , totaling roughly 1,900 pages , parfit challenges the idea , almost universally assumed by economists , and by many philosophers from david vitter onward , that the role of reason consists to tell us how to get what we want , but not to tell us what to want .
furthermore , we must reduce mental-health inequity , frequently ignored questions . seeking mental health care should be as routine and unremarkable as efforts to seek treatments for high blood pressure , diabetes , or heart . often , this is an issue in lower-income communities , where populations may be at greater risk of pathology , and often facing the highest hurdles to receiving care , partly owing to a lack of specialized resources available in wealthier districts . there are some innovative approaches to addressing this problem , such as zimbabwe ’s ’s friendship bench , and i look forward to learning more about this project from one of its representatives at davos . by acknowledging mental health and restay-at-home issues at work , we can blur our differences in our homes , schools , and communities as well .
because of this , americans can not afford to take even the minutest of a chance with their own ports , the consequences of a error being too staggering to contemplate . experts argue that the odds of a terrorist attack owing to a dubai takeover are small . but the damage inflicted by the attack might be tremendous , because ports are thought to be one of the few ways terrorists might smuggle nuclear weapons in america . the american public understands this , too , even if their president does not . should the harm inflicted by a terrorist attack also be small .
but the four political developments being redrafted by the international security agenda are likely to transform chicago into a high-profile summit in its own right . first , the revolutions in the arab world , together with nato ’s military intervention in libya , have returned the alliance ’s attention to the middle east and northern afghanistan . second , an international financial crisis will have enormous effects on nato members ’ defense budgets . third , in a recent speech last june , outgoing us secretary of defense robert gates revived the debate on transatlantic taxation and solidarity within the alliance itself . at long last , the first nato summit to take place at the united nations in 13 years is taking place not only during an election year , but also as president barack obama ’s hometown .
can we really count on these farmers , many of them desperately poor , take a leadership role in addressing our twin challenge of food security and environmental sustainability ? we believe that the answer to both questions is a resounding yes . together , they govern vast areas of our planet , including more than 80 % of farmland in sub-saharan africa and asia . yet smallholders can not be ignored when they co-exist with climate-change solutions : the world ’s 1000 smallholder farms account for 60 % of global agriculture production , and make up less than 80 % of food supplies in developing countries . so can they produce more food , while protecting the natural environment ?
lifting such restrictions would not only give the economy more access to the economy , but also boost long-term gdp growth . over the past decade , foreigners have been barred from making investments in more than 40 industries designated as “ critical for national security ” by the us government . this ban , while beneficial for industry insiders , has diminished russia ’s access to financial markets and , more critical , new technologies that follow the pattern of financial inflows . the financial sanctions that followed russia ’s coerced “ reunification with crimea ” in 2014 intensified russia ’s further , as has the country ’s own moves to retaliate : a series of sweeping trade restrictions , including outright prohibitions on food imports from the european union and the us . lifting those restrictions would not only give the economy an immediate boost ; it would also boost long-term gdp growth .
during negotiations with eu leaders ahead of the referendum , british prime minister david cameron extracted an opt-out clause in the matter of a decision to move toward ever-closer union . the relationship between cee countries and the uk has always been rather fraught . in the 1990s , the uk turned out to have been a proponent of eu membership for cee countries at a time when leaders in france and germany remained very hesitant about eu enlargement . but uk support had a catch : british leaders , reluctant to embrace the eu ’s long-stated objective of an “ ever-closer union ” that implies political unification , and shared national and federal sovereignty – made no secret of their desire to use eu membership to resist deepening european integration . should it prevail in the referendum and convince voters to remain , it would send a dangerous signal to illiberal politicians in eastern europe .
and law students should focus on the crossroads of big data and human rights , thereby helping them navigate a world in which human beings ’ worth can no longer be taken for granted . entrepreneurial majors should study the economic and political history to avoid becoming a blind determinists . and law students should focus on the crossroads of big data and human rights , in order to gain the insight they will need to defend people from forces that might seek to transform individuals into disposable components . economists need to learn from computerization students , because it will be engineers to build a future workforce . educators preparing students for this future must start now .
in my experience , 99 % of all censorship occurs with writers and producers themselves . sporadic complaints and warnings from above enabled them to develop an intuitive sense of the boundaries of acceptable content , thereby creating evidence that is free from offending material from the outset . in effect , the system has become largely self-regulating . serious breaches can result in reprimands or dismissals . top-down hierarchy is both autocratic and arbitrary ; lower levels have little collaborative input , and no right of appeal .
tokyo – japanese prime minister shinzo abe ’s government has decided to extend the diet ’s current session on 95 days until september 27 made to the longest steady session in the japanese parliament ’s postwar history . abe ’s activism at the diet comes at the heels of his performance on the recent g-7 summit in germany , where he broke with japan ’s tradition . but the summit showed japan not to stand on the diplomatic sidelines . the reason is clear : abe is determined to pass a batch of national-security bills permitting a reinterpretation of japan ’s ’s constitution that enables the country to play a greater role not only in enhancing its own national security , but also in advancing world peace . for the preceding 39 years , japanese representatives to the g-7 focused on economic discussions at such meetings , content to remain largely silent as the industrialized world ’s other leaders surveyed the planet ’s political hot spots and recommended action , or , more often , inaction .
in february 1996 , kohl urged that nato put enlargement at hold until the next russian and u.s. presidential elections passed . he instructed ministers not to discuss the matter publicly , and suggested that the talks should not be left with the hands of nato 's machinery alone . in germany 's parliament , the german chancellor announced that yeltsin would " renew the necessary dialogue and address specific issues more urgently , like nato enlargement … and have been able to reach agreement with president clinton , president chirac , and prime minister major , that the us would now refrain firmly from acting firmly in dealing with the important nato-led enlargement in some framework in order to make moscow not feel that we are creating a fiat compli . " to underline this , the chancellor 's first foreign policy activity after his return from his summer holiday was a visit in early september to the ailing boris yeltsin , with whom kohl had friendly relations . this visit yielded another appeal not to rush nato enlargement .
the result has been a litany of “ post-utopian ” values that include a heavier emphasis on individual liberty and individual responsibility . in this world , without utopia , individual liberty is the ultimate supreme value . but when , as with any change of such magnitude , the holdouts are . the result is a litany of “ post-utopian ” values that comprise a stronger emphasis on individual liberty and individual responsibility . at the same time , those changes are triggering a change in human consciousness , with some of their appeal .
london – the gravity of the euro crisis has finally sunk in . so far , many questions have been answered about design ; implementation will be at least as demanding . eurozone leaders must now aim to preserve not only the single currency , but also the gains from european financial integration . the stakes could not be higher , either . governments and international financial institutions have scrambled to craft not only the single currency , but the gains from european financial integration .
washington , dc – while much of the developed world is properly worried about myriad privacy outrages on the hands of big tech and demanding – and securing – for individuals a “ right ” to be forgotten , ” ” ” ” ” ” many parts of the world are posing a very different question : what about the right to be seen ? and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to america ’s interests elsewhere around the world . the recently targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has much interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
the swiss re-examined their own government ’s own drug policies with pragmatic eye . health-care professionals took the lead in a campaign to press the government – through mechanisms for direct democracy – to shift its focus from arresting and punishing drug users toward public-health policies that are premised on scientific evidence of what works . likewise , the swiss federal ministry of public-health research overseen an experiment in prescribing heroin to people who had lived with opiate dependency on a massive scale . the swiss federal state ’s public-health administration also oversaw an experiment in prescribing heroin to people who had lived with opiate dependency over substantial periods . it has consumed untold numbers of victims in afghanistan , burma , colombia , the us , and mexico .
washington , dc – the impact that groundbreaking technological advances like artificial intelligence will have on the functioning of our economies and labor markets was a hot topic for a long time to come . but jerry kaplan ’s recent book humans need not apply : a conduit for wealth and work in an age of artificial intelligence has impressed me the true size of the socioeconomic stakes . one relatively well-known recent example of the digital revolution ’s impact on the workings of markets is the ability to earn vast returns in high-speed trading by being a micro second “ ahead ” ” ” for everyone else . another is the capacity for price discrimination by new e-market makers like uber , which is thus appropriate every penny of the old “ consumer surplus made up of microeconomic theory . ” early a new kind of enhanced by uber could emerge , an integrating automobile , airbus , ships , airplane travel , and hotel rooms in one super-app left .
to that end , finding ways to identify and maximize forms of complementarity is vital . some 2.1 billion people worldwide worldwide lack access to safe , readily available fresh water at home , and more than twice as many – a whopping $ 4.5 billion do not safely manage sanitation , severely undermining health outcomes , and fueling river pollution . in a world of scarce resources , policymakers must prioritize their investments , including by differentiating indispensable from want . global health and conservation professionals must cooperate more closely to find these solutions – and persuade policymakers to pursue them . with an increasing share of the world ’s population – including many of the same people – feeling the effects of environmental degradation and climate change firsthand , finding solutions simultaneously that advance environmental protection , water provision , and health could not become more important .
this is an unwelcoming development for software providers , whose business model is based on licensing and annual maintenance fees , rather than electricity usage . indeed , ceos and other top executives need technologists , or at least technology-savvy , and constantly evaluate how innovations will affect the status quo , specifically their profit pools . companies across industries now need to invest in understanding the new technologies in order to learn opportunity , or mount efficient defenses quickly . indeed , ceos and other top executives must become vulnerable as startups become better equipped , more competitive , and a capable group , like larger firms , to reach buyers and users everywhere . indeed , large firms in almost any field are vulnerable as startups become better equipped , more competitive , and capable , like larger firms , to reach buyers and users everywhere .
by 2013 , the proportion had sunk to 13.5 % . over the last 22 years , the world ’s 193 governments will come together to develop the new global targets that must be met by 2030 . the challenge amounts to this generation ’s greatest opportunity to translate high aspirations into concrete goals . over the last 22 years , the world ’s 193 governments will come together to develop almost two billion more people , no small feat . although the developing world had 1.7 billion more people per year than it was in 1991 , 209 million fewer were starving .
fifteen people were killed , and much more injured in what is remembered as the peterloo massacre . the greed and corruption of that era satirized in 1873 by mark twain and charles dudley warner in their book the gilded age : a story for today . ultimately , the reform act of 1832 abolished the rotten boroughs , extending the franchise to the new middle class ( the working class and women would have to wait ) . moreover , the united states , too , went as a period of robin ber-baron industrialization in the 1870 ’s and 1880 ’s ’s ’s . the greed and corruption of that era was satirized in 1873 by mark twain and charles dudley warner in their book the gilded age : the story of today .
but , thanks to farage – and the farage who have taken over the governing conservative party , an economic self-harm act that clearly runs counter to the national interest is portrayed as the apotheosis of british patriotism . narrow-minded nationalism is not simply a british malady : throughout the west , much of the public sees globalization as a leaderless , lacks a human face , and , akin to the uncontrolled coalmine . but , thanks to farage – and the farage who has taken over the governing conservative party , an economic self-harm act that clearly runs counter to the national interest – is portrayed as the apotheosis of british patriotism . moderate leaders everywhere must now respond not only to the economic discontent of the millions they are losing out , but also to cultural pessimism and the dismissal of politicians as being subsumed only on their own , by granting succor to the populist nationalism promoted by trump cheerleader stephen bannon and his ilk . what makes things worse enough in britain is also a series of gross errors of political judgment , during and following the 2016 referendum campaign .
it has been successful because of strong public support for the fight against corruption . ande proposed the creation of a new court by amending the constitution . every firm and business association needs to decide on the best strategies and tactics to pursue in their own countries . a survey of existing laws and regulations found that many of them were conflicted and overlapping . ande proposed the creation of a new court by amending the constitution .
a year ago , every one gathered in the streets of kyiv knew what we stood up against : a corrupt government that sought to command life and labor and a dispose of state property at its will . in evicting that regime , we believed that this form of absolutism was ended . instead , those who benefited most from the regime = s corruptions insisted that their rights to the land that they stolen were inviolate . in so far as formal legal rights existed , no court could be relied upon to enforce these rights when our rulers saw their interests as being challenged . how , then , did ukraine achieve this state of cynicism ?
one community was provided with round-the-clock access to micronutrient and protein supplement called atole . another community nearby had the same program , except that micronutrient supplement was provided without protein . for children who received atole , the risks of stunting fell by more than one-half . moreover , there were more than one-half that of health workers who visited their mothers . stay in school longer , learned more , scored higher on cognitive tests in adulthood , and were more likely to work in higher-paying , skilled jobs .
from day one , the coalition has been riven by feuds . poland , hungary , even russia : in all three , infighting among reformers allowed a political heirs to the communists to reassert power . poland , hungary , even russia : in all three , infighting among reformers allowed a political heirs to the communists to reassert power . such a squabbling seems to be the postcommunist crime . the ministers acted as adversaries rather than partners .
though the economy was at full employment , they rebelled against the status quo in the name of dubious utopias inspired by fidel castro of cuba , and mao ’s ally , china . the difference between then and now is that those who took to the streets to protest macron ’s proposed fuel-tax increase is animated not by a utopia but by desperation . what they joined with well-organized trade unions is what helped the movement reach a critical mass , at least temporarily . in this sense , neither the yellow vest uprising , nor the french brexit , is unlike that of the french brexit , in which it amounts to a shooting act in their foot . whereas the british resorted to the ballot box , the french have enacted a mixture of barricades , marches , and corestone cast .
and she has little doubt that the west , in responding to the arab league ’s entreaty to intervene , avoided a replay of srebrenica in north africa . she worries about the early human-rights violations , especially women ’s rights , which she fears could multiply . what strikes me the most are that she sees , even then , the beginnings of tribal conflicts and the upcoming contest among the islamists to outdo one another in fundamentalist purity . she feels that in acting as she has done , she has been faithful to her most cherished values and beliefs . it is she who remembers everything and regrets none at all .
the most prominent feature , then , is trade . facing escalating geopolitical competition with america , china is scrambling to win friends in the region . as the largest trade partner of many asian countries , china will offer attractive trade terms to its neighbors , much as it has done with singapore . although china ’s charm offensive is extremely recent , its contours are already clear . over the last six months , america has abandoned its four-decade-old policy of engaging with china , embracing an eu containment strategy .
london – “ shorting ” is a tactic well known among the finance of the cognoscenti . it means betting against an asset with borrowed money in the expectation of making a profit when its value swings down . for example : on january 1 , 2010 , it seems to me myself that the play will soon be up to the greeks . a speculator can “ short ” a government by borrowing its debt at its current price , in the hope of selling it later at an inferior price and pocketing the difference . a speculator can “ short ” a government by borrowing its debt at its current price , in the hope of selling it later at a low price and pocketing the difference .
in response to such extortionary practices , king abdullah ii decried the emergence of a character assassination ” through the online news media , and demanded that the government establish a regulatory framework for this unruly new sector . indeed , the lack of restraint allowed dubious journalistic practices to flourish . taking advantage of the news media ’s implicit authority , they published any potentially damaging rumor of individuals or groups with means and influence , then offering to remove a narrative in exchange for a previously paid advertisement or a outright cash payment . moreover , many people launched news web sites exclusively for financial gain . jordan ’s diverse tribal mix reflected in newly established web sites , some created with tacit backing and even funding – from security agencies or other official or political groups .
the poison of terrorism has now lashed out down to the un ’s humanitarian work , with the tragic bombing of its iraqi mission . predictably , president bush has restated his determination to wage war on terrorism . dozens of innocent human beings have been killed , including one of the deadliest peacemakers in the world , sergio vieira de mello . other leaders have declared that the un should not abandon its mission . yet the bombardment is raising political questions that called for answers .
but now russia threatens to recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia if the west recognizes the serbian province of kosovo as an independent nation . to expand russia ’s political clout over georgia of separatist regions , gazprom , without taking trouble to ask for the authorization of georgian ’s democratically elected leaders , has started constructing a gas pipeline that connects russia and south ossetia directly . although there has been no interruptions of gas supplies from tbilisi to south ossetia , this step is necessary for the kremlin to ensure even greater integration into this georgian region into russia ’s economic system . now russia threatens to recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia if the west recognizes the serbian province of kosovo as an independent nation . to the extent that the overwhelming majority of citizens of abkhazia and south ossetia have already been given russian citizenship , recognition of those two regions ’ national sovereignty would be wholly fictitious , and indeed an interim measure on the road to their full annexation by russia .
the sad truth is that many of today ’s elites seem to have learned nothing from history and thought and act as if interests and values were totally disconnected from one another in the real world . so long as trump is good at entrepreneurship , they appear unworried that he is america ’s one biggest threat to america ’s soul and values , as well as its image and interests abroad . back then , german bankers and bosses deluded themselves in thinking that they could master their country an vulgar new chancellor . and they were persuaded that , despite hitler ’s bizarre behavior and appearances , he remains the best defenses against communism . sure , trump may turn a bit too far with the chinese on trade , but at least he was asking the right questions .
even more worryingly , this would open the door for provisions to outlawing benign , low-risk data mining that is driving online ads . the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s privacy crackdown is at risk of undermining all of this . online advertising enables eu citizens to access affordable information , educational material , commerce channels , and entertainment sites without having to pay less ; and what amounts to is being spent in europe is growing fast . even more worryingly , this would open the door for provisions to outlawing benign , low-risk data mining that is driving online advertising . online advertising enables eu citizens to access information , educational material , commerce channels , and entertainment sites without much to pay for them , and what is being done in europe is growing fast .
for example , a joint soas-oxford study on menstruation in uganda found that adolescent girls often missed school because they lack access to clean sanitary products . but when reusable sanitary pads and education about menstruation was delivered to girls in at least eight schools , attendance rose by an average of more than 17 % . today , the bloody good period donates sanitary products – including pads and tampons , as well as diapers and toiletries – to more than a dozen uk resource centers for asylum-seekers each month . but the silence surrounding the natural process of menstruation must be broken , so that women and girls can acquire the sanitary products they need at affordable prices . when program programs are developed alongside rigorous research , the effect can be dramatic .
a new law regulating the judiciary , for example , had been the revolution ’s demand for a revolution from its early weeks . it had already backed down twice : once in july 2012 , after abandoning its effort , under pressure from the workers ' party council , to reinstate an elected parliament ; and once when it sought to remove public prosecutors by making egypt its ambassador to the holy see . for morsi , the dilemma was that the constitutional court might strike down the law , rendering efforts meaningless . but , for many revolutionaries , there were other ways to sack the tainted prosecutor and cleanse the judiciary . morsi ’s “ constitutional declaration ” was a decisive – albeit undemocratic , polarizing , and thus politically costly – step to break the impasse .
tillerson ’s nostalgia for 1823 was not shared south of the border , where , as one mexican commentator highlighted , the monroe doctrine – which was intended to justify gringo interventions , ” ” ” ” and where china has increased engagement is viewed as a counterweight to america . moreover , it amounts to treason of america ’s longstanding commitment to uphold a rules-based monetary system that is discouraging competitive currency devaluation . in foreign policy , american secretary of state rex tillerson endorsed the revival of the monroe doctrine , nineteenth-century pronouncements of american primacy in the western hemisphere , aimed at keeping european competitors at – also in central and south america – in order to curb china ’s increasing leverage . the trump administration has also unveiled a new , more aggressive us nuclear policy . its nuclear posture review proposes using nuclear strikes in response to non-nuclear threats , and deploying new “ low-yield ” nuclear devices to deliver a submarine equivalent to those that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 .
unless they are backed by strong institutional structures at all levels , such arrangements will prove futile in managing capital flows . in other emerging markets , too , a key challenge is to ensure that all macroeconomic and structural policies advance common goals . policymakers in both advanced and emerging countries alike should focus on underlying failure that destabilize their economies and impede growth , rather than attempting to cure symptoms through manipulation of monetary policies or capital controls . at the same time , the governance structure of a multilateral institution like the international monetary fund needs to be reformed , to bolster their legitimacy in emerging markets . otherwise , such institutions will remain ineffective in confronting collective problems relating to macroeconomic-policy spillovers , and in providing crisis-prone insurance .
though the challenges facing the middle class are well documented , america ’s leaders have mostly failed to recognize fully the struggles of middle-class households , much less to implement effective countermeasures . meanwhile , the economic challenges facing the developed-country middle class are largely the result of two factors : the rapid loss of white – and of the blue-collar jobs to automation , and the shift of middle - and lower-value-added jobs to countries with lower labor costs . the latter pattern depressed income and wage growth not only in the tradable sector directly , but also in the non-tradable service sector , owing to the hollowing out of displaced labor . the economic challenges facing the developed-country middle class are mostly the result of two factors : the rapid loss of white – and of the blue-collar jobs to automation , and the shift of middle - and lower-value-added jobs toward countries with lower labor costs . the fall in labor conditions and falling real minimum wages may have contributed to income polarization , though these are probably secondary factors .
zurich – finland ’s central-bank governor , olli rehn , has reiterated his call for the european central bank to conduct a long-overdue review of its policy framework . the upcoming change of leadership at the institution , with christine lagarde , the international monetary fund managing director since 2011 , arguably successful mario draghi as president , offers an important opportunity to heed that call . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . the targeted killing by the united states by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
for decades , europe constituted the world of the most successful , stable , and predictable region , a place where history seemed to have all but ended . the goal of making the continent peaceful , whole , and free was largely realized . yet dramatic change has come , until now . one factor is the willingness and capacity shown by vladimir putin ’s russia to use military force , economic coercion , and cyber-manipulation to advance its agenda . such scenarios , until fairly recently , were unimaginable .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . batang toru is just one of many planned infrastructure projects worldwide that is officially thought to be environmentally sound , despite posing serious environmental risks . for example , construction is almost complete on a railroad line through kenya ’s notorious nairobi national fleet , despite public outrage over an “ incomplete and incompetent ” report on the environmental impact . batang toru is just one of the many planned infrastructure projects worldwide that is officially believed to be environmentally sound , despite posing serious environmental risks .
in many ways , those measures succeeded : monetary expansion played a major role in bringing the economy back from the brink . but , over time , the capacity of central banks to affect the real economy declined . for the ecb , this generates an especially serious challenge . today , and for the foreseeable future , domestic inflation is increasingly being influenced globally , rather than local , development , and financial ( in ) stability and fiscal policy are far more influential than monetary policy . after all , unlike other central banks , it must account for the preferences of the 19 sovereign national governments with little to no structural , fiscal-policy coordination .
looking at a fast-growing city like houston , texas , we might see the true effects of the urban heat island . today , the fastest-growing large cities are occurring in asia , and this year alone . in august , temperatures climbed 12.5 oc above the surrounding rural areas , reaching the 40oc – a scorching heat that affects not only the downtown area , but also obscured some 8,000 square kilometers . there are an even more dramatic increase , to be sure , in tokyo . in august , temperatures climbed 12.5 oc above the surrounding rural areas , reaching the 40oc – a scorching heat that affects not only the downtown area , but also obscured some 8,000 square kilometers .
and , as coworkers started to exercise alongside each other , enlightened employers came to view such recreation as a precious source of physical and mental well-being . a rising minority began to pursue intense physical activity not in fields or factories , but in leisure settings . gyms became new sources of community , too . some people saw these changes taking place and began to worry about them . the swede of one ’s brow was no longer joined by productive work but by consumption , often by conspicuous consumption .
some , such as the danish people ’s party , want to follow the united kingdom ’s lead and hold its eu membership vote . hungarian prime minister viktor orbán has declared that he will hold a referendum on proposed quotas . others want to escape europe , block the trans-atlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) with the united states , or limit labor mobility . according to the european council on foreign relations , there are 32 referenda in 18 countries across the eu . the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s scheme for refugee relocation has proved to be especially divisive .
it has repeatedly said that us exports are good for america : they create jobs . but american exports are other nations that are ’ imports , so obama ’s argument amounts to telling others to lose their jobs . from the start of his presidency , obama ’s defense of the liberal trade regime has been inadequate . it needs to remind america that imports are also good : one can surely ask its audience to think about jobs in ups cargo aircraft , freight trains , and trucks that carry imports in the american interior . the main problem , however , is that obama has been unable to confront , and has laid to rest ; america ’s labor unions are ’ fear-driven trade hostility .
it was only in the eighteenth-century eighteenth century that greed became morally venerable . it was now deemed healthily promethean to turn wealth into money and re-set it to work to generate more money because of its ability to do that one benefited humanity . it was only in the eighteenth century that greed became morally venerable . the end of capitalism meant simply the end of the urge to listen . it was now deemed healthily promethean to turn wealth into money , and it was putting it to work to earn more money because of that one benefited humanity .
by driving users underground , criminalization contributes to the deepening public-health crisis . this pattern persists across central and eastern europe , where governments have also been reluctant to imprison drug users . poland is also choosing to treat possession of even the smallest amount of drugs as a criminal , as demonstrated by the fact that an estimated 60 % of people sentenced to drug holding drug possession are marijuana smokers . by driving users underground , criminalization is contributing to a deepening public-health crisis . rather than focus on treatments that work , the polish government chooses to give priority to the long-term rehabilitation centers located in the depths of poland , which has little , if anything , to do with evidence-based medicine .
frankfurt – the european central bank is at the center of the big , risky experiment . crisis management has been transformed through major market distortions , with certain segments of their performance no longer explainer through fundamental economic data . by contrast , financial markets are flooded through liquidity , if not by all of them . the unintended consequences of this policy have become increasingly visible , and will become increasingly tangible with the american federal reserve ’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy . meanwhile , financial markets are flooded with liquidity .
within the indian ocean , nato is working with the european union , and from many others to police large sea-lanes threatened by pirates . in the indian ocean , nato works with the european union , and many others to police large sea-lanes threatened by its pirates . nato is developing a ballistic-missile defense capability to protect our european populations and territories against one side ’s grave and growing threat . the alliance has evolved into what is essentially a security-driven organization that is flexible , efficient , and cost-effective . threats have gone global and become more global .
meanwhile , the trump administration is attempting to turn back the clock , by betting on the resuscitation of the dying – and lethal – fossil-fuel industry . while china ’s dependence on fossil-fuel reserves has left it mired in a deep environmental hole , the authorities are determined to step up . describing the shift to electric vehicles as a jobs killer , trump has advocated ending federal subsidies that encourage domestic development , produce , and purchase , like the us ’s $ 7,500 federal tax credit . meanwhile , the trump administration is trying to turn back the clock , by betting on the resuscitation of the dying – and the lethal – fossil-fuel industry . and , anticipating an eventual replacement of conventional motor vehicles globally , the authorities are providing generous domestic subsidies .
provided non-discriminatory , such border pricing would enhance global welfare and be compatible with the rules of the world trade organization . but calculating an appropriate tax would be extremely difficult in practice . it would , for example , necessitate the fiscal equivalent of regulatory ceilings . the measure might also invite countries like the united states to retaliate with distorting measures , making the rules somewhat perilous . moreover , a tax would likely have regressive distributional effects , hurt the poor the most .
ideally , such cooperation would occur within the eu ’s institutional framework . eurozone countries , along with others , would be willing to join the eu in the future ( a “ eurozone plus ” ) , might simply decide to use legal means to enhance cooperation . moreover , article 138 would enable unified eurozone representation at the center of the international monetary fund and the world bank . if all eurozone members took part , article 136 of the eu treaty on the functioning of the eu could be used to support their action.the degree of this provition.it alleges that , “ the [ european ] council shall adopt the measure of measures specific to [ the european ] member states , ” ” ” ” ” and that only [ european member states would take sides on the vote ” – is wide . the group could then expand cooperation across three additional policy areas :
and agnes m. sigurðardóttir , iceland ’s bishop , has warned that a ban would effectively turn judaism and islam into “ criminalized religions , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” because anyone practicing circumcision might be subject to a fine of contravention [ of ] religious freedom . for his part , imam ahmad seddeeq of iceland ’s islamic cultural centers have countered that circumcision is an integral part of muslim faith , and that the gunnarsdóttir ’s bill amounts to a clash of faith [ of ] religious freedom . gunnarsdóttir accepts that “ everybody has the right to believe in what they want , ” but she insists that , “ children ’s rights come above the right to believe . ” complicating matters further , both sides are basing their human-rights arguments on the basis of their human-rights arguments . for his part , imam ahmad seddeeq of iceland ’s islamic cultural outhead warned that the ban would effectively turn judaism and islam into “ criminalized religions , ” ” ” ” because anyone practicing circumcision might be subject to up for six years in
but policy analysts can not limit themselves to the classic instruments of nuclear deterrence , punishment , and denial , because they assess opportunities for deterrence and dissuasion in cyberspace . moreover , they should pay heed to mechanisms of entanglement and norms . entanglement can alter the cost-benefit calculus of a major state like china , but it probably has little effect on a state like north korea that is weakly linked to the global economy . to be sure , entering any adversary ’s network and disrupting attacks poses the danger of escalation . “ persistent engagement ” may nonetheless help to stimulate deterrence at such a difficult time .
here , the eu ’s summit in december was an important step forward in terms of deepening political union and building stronger governance among the eurozone ’s member states . moreover , if we want the eu to emerge stronger from the crisis , it must also strike a better balance between austerity and pro-growth policies , because , without growth and higher employment , the eurozone ’s problems can not be resolved . but more will be required to restore financial stability , for example , by enlarging the general firepower of the european financial stability facility . acknowledging a more stringent , more rigorous stability pact is also a imperative to achieve greater integration . moreover , if we want the eu to emerge stronger from the crisis , it must also strike a better balance between growth-enhancing policies and pro-growth policies , because , without growth and higher employment , the eurozone ’s problems can not be resolved .
it ultimately financing through retail bank deposits , the banks ’ wealth-management products , and private-equity funds . shadow banking in china is dominated by lending to higher-risk borrowers , such as local governments , property developers , and small and medium-size enterprises . in 2007 , the volume of shadow-banking transactions in the u.s. exceeded that of conventional banking assets . in 2011 , chinese shadow banking totals only some $ 2.2 trillion . shadow banking in china has been dominated by lending to higher-risk borrowers like local governments , asset developers , and small and medium-size enterprises .
in 2009 , obama envisioned a settlement of the conflict through a powerful international community commitment . in 2011 , he asserted that only both sides ’ willingness could ensure a successful outcome . clearly , the american people can not do much to resolve the conflict . there is no overarching explanation for obama ’s successive middle east failures , but there are several factors worth considering : the surge in the number of asymmetrical conflicts , in which the traditional use of force is largely ineffective ; increasingly blurred headlines between difficult allies and rigid adversaries ; and major political differences between a centrist us president and a congress that is dominated more than ever by extreme ideas . but obama himself bears a large part of the blame .
but it can be extraordinarily good for any developing country , which fosters a dampening balance of inward investment and local entrepreneurship , and exploit the proceeds of export-led growth to invest in their infrastructure and skills . in the future , however , this type of trade will probably become less important . as economists like mit ’s david autor have shown , the effects of this in a advanced country can be both bad and bad for some workers and good for society ’s gains . china ’s dramatic economic success would have been impossible without labor-cost trade initially driven by labor-cost disparities . with wages in china now rising rapidly , its labor cost advantage is set to shrink rapidly .
beijing – just how fast is china ’s population aging and what does a lower share of the working-age population mean for the country is one of economic development ? nowadays , most demographic predictions for china are based on the country ’s total fertility rate ( tfr ) of 1.8 , have been all but unchanged for 20 years . but population-survey data published by the national bureau of statistics ( tfr ) suggest that tfr has been below 1.5 for many years , and the united nations ’ recently published report , world fertility patterns , 2009 , revises china ’s tfr to 1.4 in 2006 , placing it among the world ’s low fertility countries . a prolonged period of low fertility implies that the rate of china ’s population is aging and working-age population is slowing . could – and should – be doing this , particularly for the country ’s “ one child ” policy , to slow this trend ?
until the currency crashes of the 1990s , emerging-market and developing countries tended to target their exchange rates . but , having repeatedly missed their targets , they have repeatedly missed their targets . the problem with these monetary-policy approaches is that while a particular numerical target may be rational when it is set , successive unexpected developments often make the targets hard to live with one another . many then switched to inflation targeting ; but they tend to miss those targets even more often than advanced countries do . after the monetarist approach failed , some switched to targeting inflation targeting .
indeed , the dangers that europe now faces in the wake of socializing debt far outweigh the mere potential financial crisis . the lesson to be drawn from the greek debacle is that the eurozone needs to develop sovereign-debt insolvency procedures as soon as possible , thereby preventing other sovereigns from turning their creditors into creditors through debt mutualization . unless this wisdom is heeded , europe together will become impossible . if the european union ’s national governments want to help one another in a crisis , they should provide unilaterally humanitarian assistance , with no conditionality and no redemption . if you lend to a friend , europe should no longer be a friend .
finally , orbán and his supporters maintain their grip on power partly by relying on gerrymandering and voter suppression ( which mostly affects the hungarians living in western europe ) . they do n’t make america great , or even right ; they make it hungarian . orbán is a pariah in european circles for having dented hungarian democracy , yet trump recently welcomed him to the white house by describing him as “ respected everywhere in europe . ” trump and his advisers have evidently learned a big role from orbán on racist immigration policies , and on how to destroy a liberal democracy . trump ’s republican party is using similar tactics .
while orbán has used economic pressure to force the closure of the hungarian opposition media , trump has described the press as “ the enemy of the people ” and threatened libel activism against critical outlets . at the same time , trump has purged some 17,000 of public officials by firing us state department employees , shutting down his government , freezing up pay , and creating an atmosphere of hostility to honest , open debate about how to formulate and execute a policy . trump is doing much the same , with the consequence that america ’s government is now losing around 94 % of its legislative court cases . by politicizing america ’s administrative agencies , beginning to capture the department of justice and committing itself to turn its ideological judicial appointments , trump is now far along his quest to corrupt judicial appointments , and compromised libel behavior against critical outlets . making matters worse , orbán has destroyed hungary ’s independent civil service , and thoroughly politicized law-enforcement administration .
to decide not to challenge these data , folta continues , and instead to try to publish a map show that munich is squarely in the gulf of mexico , opposing all other figures , and the claims of millions of rather dry germans , do not make you brilliant . in fact , folta offers a brilliant send-up of ayyadurai ’s work . but it is unclear from ayyadurai ’s article that the data were used and there is no validation of the model . “ if you developed a computer program that integrated internet data to predict the munich location , and the program told you it was squarely in the gulf of mexico , opposing all other figures and the claims of millions of rather dry germans , does not make you brilliant . instead , this means that you have made a mistake , within your agenda , its assumptions , or its input ’s data , all of which are testable .
but , by the fall of 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis , eurozone heads of state did not consider creating a joint bank-rescue fund . instead , they settled on a package of national measures to stabilize the national banking systems one by one . in other words , europe faces a fundamental , collective-action problem . the sum of the headline commitment was impressive , amounting to more than 20 % of gdp . experience showed that only an acute crisis can force europe ’s leaders to act together in a concerted effort .
then , in 1999 , another indo-pakistani skirmish over kashmir erupted , after pakistan sent troops into the indian-controlled district of kargil . a 17-day war ensued , but the status quo prevailed . the two sides fought again in 1971 , although kashmir was not the focus . western pakistan was forced to surrender , and east pakistan became an independent state of bangladesh . after the civil war pitting then-west pakistan against the bengali freedom fighters of then-east pakistan fueled a surge of east refugees , india began to support rebel groups there .
moreover , the tubercle bacillus engages in trench warfare , gaining resentment against conventional antibiotics , and canonical vaccination approaches , as well as delaying diagnosis and determination of drug sensitivity . with the rise of the 1980 ’s in parts of hiv making a promise of a immune system , tb re-emerged , and has been the number-one killer of hiv/aids individuals . treatment of tb requires at least three drugs that have been administered over at least six months . roughly 15 million people suffer from co-infection by hiv , and mycobacterium tuberculosis , a primary causative proxy in most tb cases . roughly 15 million people suffer from co-infection by hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis , a primary causative agent in most tb cases .
in 1954 , france rejected the european union ’s proposed constitution , which could have marked the beginning of the process of political unification . now the disadvantages of strengthening europe ’s fiscal union do n’t end there . ironically , continued progress toward fiscal union would make political union all the more unlikely for one simple but an important reason : france . europe ’s strongest military strength by far france has thwarted any attempt to pool europe ’s armed forces . in 1954 , france rejected the european union ’s proposed constitution , which could have marked the beginning of the process of political unification .
now , central banks must reconcile the need to maintain price stability with accountability , regardless of whether they are legally mandated – to minimize financial vulnerability . this will not be easy , not least because of another new operating burden that many central banks have placed on : macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision . above all , micro-prudential supervision implies the risk of political pressure , interference with central banks ’ autonomy , and policy conflicts – all of which might influence financial intermediaries ’ behavior , by compelling them to assume greater risk . now , central banks must reconcile the need to maintain price stability with accountability – regardless of whether it is legally mandated to do so – to minimize financial vulnerability . this , in turn , will have powerful tools at their disposal , not least because of another new operating burden that has been at the heart of many central banks : macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision .
under standard economic reasoning , this is inefficient . if the small , unproductive firms closed off and bigger , more productive firms hired their workers , total output and well-being would soar . so , why does n’t this happen routinely in the developing world ? if the small , unproductive firms closed down and bigger , more productive firms hired their workers , total output and well-being would soar . compared to developed countries , an unusually large number of small , unproductive firms coexist with a small number of large , productive firms .
as china ’s new leadership team emerges , global attention has centered on president jiang zemin ’s successor . mr. zhu has been china ’s jack welch , the tough-minded , longtime ceo of the american conglomerate general -- a man celebrated for his candor , his global sophistication and insistence on performance . but that is misguided , for perhaps the most important moment in china ’s recent history of boom and transformation was the appointment of zhu rongji ( pronounced “ joo rong-jee ” ) as premier of the national central committee , a position once held by deng xiaoping . given the obvious relevance of the post in recent years , the pick of mr. zhu ’s replacement may hold an even more relevance than president jiang ’s departure from the center stage . even before he became premier , mr. zhu , as the president of the people ’s central bank of china , was well known as the architect of china ’s 8 % annual economic growth in the 1990s , and mastermind his successful fight against inflation .
by contrast , trade among african countries accounts for only around 10-12 % of the continent ’s successful demutualization of its stock exchanges . by 2050 , the combined gdp of the top 11 african economies should reach more than $ 13 trillion , surpassing brazil and russia ( but not china or india ) . twenty-three bourses are currently operating in africa , and their combined market capitalization has soared from $ 245 billion in 2002 to $ 1 trillion in 2002 ( 2 % of the world ’s total ) by the end of 2009 – as high as the world ’s fifteenth-largest stock exchanges . yet , partly because a few african countries have escaped the hang-over of the global credit crisis , more investors are shifting their focus to business opportunities there . for some analysts , the emergence of countries like brazil as economic powerhouses stemmed in part from the successful demutualization of their stock exchanges .
establishing nationally , regional , and global standards is not an easy one , but it is absolutely necessary . some countries suffer when skilled workers emigrate . but failure to develop mechanisms to enable migrants to take advantage of their abilities causes leads to even more damaging . trained doctors , for example , should not be driving taxicabs of the world ’s poorest people . • accelerating eligibility for residency rights and citizenship .
unlike trump and the united kingdom with a “ leave ” campaign , the national front already has a predictable core constituency , amounting to roughly one-quarter of voters ’ voters . headed into the election campaign , fillon may run on a pro-european platform , as evidenced by his pivot during the second-round debates , when he has suggested that he favors forming a european governing government . what ’s more , political catholicism still appeals to many french voters , and the church itself wants to lure catholics away from the national front and return to its more traditionally conservative fold . fillon , for his part , can probably muster the same level of support and may even skim votes away from le pen , given that around 8 % of primary voters described as the national front ’s backers . his old-french coalition is far right and disaffected working-class voters will not arrive by unannounced or defy expectations , as has occurred in america and the united kingdom .
for years , poles ranked owsiak as the country of the greatest moral authority , ahead of the pope . national media ’s narrative , portraying owsiak and civic platform as guilty parties in the wake of adamowicz ’s killings , will only undermine the pis . generations of poles participated in a charity ’s ’s fundraising drives . he pursues power without first considering the consequences of his actions . kaczyński has repeatedly demonstrating his impulsiveness verging his own .
new york – the latest fast-food hamburger you ate may have cost yourself next to nothing . but what did the tomato slice on that burger on that burger cost the worker who have it there ? almost anywhere in the world , including in the united states , costs can be shockingly high . in florida , the tomato pickers earn an average of only $ 0.50 for every 32-pound ( 14.5-kilogram ) bucket . appalling wages are only the start .
xi has said little about the chinese dream ever since , and his silence has created great difficulty . when xi first unveiled his slogan , after being chosen as the ccp ’s new general secretary , he defined it in simple , open but nonetheless generic terms : the “ chinese people ” dream of living in the same way as all other people around the globe . china ’s increasingly zealous of propaganda officials evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for a new party chief , quick hijacked the slogan ; the china dream has replaced the “ model of china ” in formal political branding . unfortunately , china propagandists that double down on being censors have a perverse ability to discredit anything they try to brand . whatever the new administration is touting it as part of its ambitious effort to make the “ china dream ” come true .
even in animals whose genes are more readily studied and far better understood , such as drosophila , a miniscule fruit fly , does not exist within a simple , one-to-one correspondence between a gene and a behavioral individual trait . fruit fly genes looks surprisingly similar to our own -- as it is to those of most other humans . even many aspects of their behavior resemble our own . instead , a wide variety of genes influence each characteristic . fruit fly genes is surprisingly similar to ours -- as it is to those of most other entities .
environmental degradation , particularly deforestation , is accelerating and corruption is running rampant , with cash derived from the opaque sources flowing into cambodia ’s casinos , banks , and the real-estate market . cambodia is currently bereft of its natural resources – including timber , rubber , and sandy scores – for private gain . pension fiduciary and fund managers now insist that the labor-intensive companies that they invest are operating in ethical , transparent ways that limit reputational risk . investment decisions on emerging-market funds are thus increasingly ahead of rigorous esg screenings – screenings that , after 34 years of hun sen ’s dictatorial rule , cambodia has little chance of passing . gone are the days when robust esg behavior has been a fine bonus for investors .
in the wake of world war ii , european countries ’ national interests were aligned . simply put , talk of a “ brexit ” exposed europe with a common army failed in 1954 , stressed that economically common ground was the key to european integration . while the british had been especially open on the nationalist nature of their support for european integration , there was no less mindful that other eu members were not mindful of their domestic concerns . simply put , talk of a “ brexit ” exposed europe with an economic and political fault lines , with no less mindful of their domestic concerns . robert peston , in his 2005 biography of then-british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , described brown ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ pragmatic view that the eu was very only insofar as it delivered the practical advantages of peace and prosperity to britain .
they view even the euro as a weapon against the dollar , and rejoice when the euro is “ strong ” and the us dollar is “ weak ” . this is a dangerous state of affairs for those on either side of the atlantic who hold national faith in the values of the enlightenment and in the constitution of liberty . there is such a thing as the west . america has found a new “ empire of evil ” in “ terrorist ” states and organizations ; europe has found a new adversary to help it integrate within the united states . quite a few in europe define the eu as an instrument for clinging to its own vis-à-vis the united states .
perhaps it will replace the widely criticized foreign minister , witold waszczykowski . in that case , tusk would most likely return to domestic politics , where the ninth victory against the pis would be that punishment kaczyński deserves . the most saryusz-wolski may realistically hope for may is some form of government seats in poland . he is only kaczyński ’s small , useful duma ” in an effort to score a political victory over a man representing the greatest threat that the pis faces . what the pis does , for its part , may hope is that some kind of coalition of countries ( such as those ruled by the social democrats ) will propose another alternative to tusk , whom eu member states will elect to avoid escalation of the conflict with poland .
i can not help but recall the situation in this summer of 1992 , when a small majority of danish voters rejected the maastricht treaty . now the eu is once again in the irish stew . but this time it is hard to see a way out of offering a second referendum . renegotiating the treaty is off the question because doing so would open a pandora ’s box of demands from everybody else . so the issue lies with iran , and must solve it .
but experiences around the world suggest that this is precisely the risk outlook . even were banks healthy , the deleveraging process , and the associated loss of wealth mean that , more likely than not , the economy will remain weak . in any case , the issues are not limited to the american economy . other countries ( like spain ) have their own real-estate crises . and a weak economy means , more likely than not , more bank losses .
for now , however , although it has increased its capacity to give military forces access to the un , nato or eu operations , germany has made it abundantly clear that it does not view itself as a military power . german policymakers continue to believe that the political and economic means for influence are more effective than violence , implying a further development of the soft-power tools , including digital diplomacy . they are also eager to develop more “ networked ” national and european foreign policies that take into account the actions and possible contributions of non-state actors . this , in turn , would be a wise choice , now that it has become apparent that germany has not embraced it as a military power . german policymakers continue to believe that the political and economic means for influence are more effective than violence , implying a further development of the soft-power tools , including digital diplomacy .
if greece and other countries are to ensure their citizens ’ health and prosperity in decades to come , they will have to find ways to prevent current economic activity from increasing an already unsustainable ecological burden . to be sure , countries with greek deficits often can fill some of the gap via global trade when they are allowed to pay for essential imports . if greece and other countries are to ensure their citizens ’ health and prosperity in the next few decades to come , they will have to find ways to prevent current economic activity from rising too far an unsustainable ecological burden . the mediterranean region has been able to ensure that its members have unique , breathtaking , natural capital is one of its greatest assets – a reason that , every year , more than 200 million tourists flock to the region , feeding the region ’s economies . for that to happen , ecological resources must come to be viewed as a valuable endowments to be managed wisely .
ms. park once pledged to provide her loans to working-class families from elementary school to college years , while contending that local universities should be empowered to have greater autonomy . but she also must persuasively outline a practical strategy to resolve south korea ’s most serious problems , including high unemployment , deteriorating education performance , and north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear-weapons program . she favors engagement policies and the six-party talks in order to resolve the country ’s nuclear woes . come presidential election-day succession in 2012 , south korean voters will elect a candidate that embodies the pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue . ultimately , park ’s success will depend on her campaign ’s efficacy further in defining her character along these lines .
and that growth requires higher public investment in infrastructure and human capital . up-front gradualism must be the name of the game . a fiscal compact like the one approved recently makes it helpful to anchor expectations about future adjustments , but only if the new system is as elastic enough to be politically credible . up-front gradualism must be the name of the play . up-front gradualism must be the name of the game .
second , the international monetary fund , under the g20 ’s “ mutual assessment process , ” has hinted that the united states is reducing its fiscal deficit to 3 % of gdp , more than $ 400 billion , in additional cuts a year . most recently , the european central bank has reiterated its position that serious fiscal consolidation will generate enough growth for the private-sector confidence that spending gains by us households and firms will more than offset lower spending by governments . the imf , however , believes that current fiscal plans will discourage american economic growth . america ’s major trading partners want america to grow and buy more of its exports . the imf , for its part , believes that current fiscal plans will deter american economic growth .
indeed , totalitarian pressure did , like john paul ii and alexander solzhenitsyn , the men for whom religious faith had bought freedom from mendacity and solitude . what i admit is that i view the legacy of communism firmly with greater skepticism . but it did the same for andrei sakharov and vaclav havel , who were defending their supreme values with their reference to , and in their language lay , humanism itself . i admit , i take for granted that i view the legacy of communism with greater skepticism about it . for most people , however , life under the totalitarian dictatorship was inennobling rather ; he was , rather , having an everyday immersion to falsehood , spiritual depravity , and material corruption .
when the un asked nearly ten million people around the world to list its priorities , the un emphasized better education and health care , fewer corruption , more job insecurity , and affordable food . at the same time , the world bank ’s climate-smart focus issue is at odds with what the world of its poorest citizens want . clearly , the evidence shows that direct policies are far more effective . when the un asked nearly ten million people worldwide to list their priorities , it emphasized better education and health care , fewer corruption , more job training , and affordable food . at the same time , global warming has come to a close some 16 issues .
trump , too , bemoans america ’s contributions to the green climate fund ( and sneers at the name for some reason as one well ) . he complains that america has already committed more than $ 1 billion without explaining to the american people and the world that $ 1 billion is a contribution of $ 3.08 per american . trump carries on about the paris accord ’s supposed bias in favor of india , but fails to acknowledge that india ’s per capita emissions stand at 1.6 tons , on average , one-tenth of america ’s level . consider the most recent figures for the year 2014 from the international energy agency 2016 . the us co2 emissions from energy and industry averaged 4.5 tons per person ( 32.4 billion tons per person in the iea ’s tabulation ) , whereas america ’s emissions were almost four times that level , 16.2 tons per person ( 5.2 billion tons for its 320 million people ) .
as one wag has put it , “ we have met with the un and it is us ! ” as one wag has put it , “ we have met with the un and it is us ! and when they ca n’t bargain on a course of action , it ’s hard for an organization to operate . true , un secretary general ban ki moon can make speeches , convene meetings , and propose actions , but his role is more secretary of state than general . what hard power the un has to be aggrieved and borrowed by member states .
perhaps for this reason , there has been talk of a meeting in astana between the presidents of russia and france , america ’s secretary of state , and presidents of armenia and azerbaijan . a meeting of us presidents , after all , is the ultimate negotiating forum and must result in genuine , sustainable success . otherwise , no amount of negotiation can help to set the caucasus straight , powerfully undermining some key restraint that prevent both sides from trying once again to achieve a military solution . there is a reason not to hold a similar meeting between the two great opportunities and the serious risks that the two sides face . that prospect holds both great opportunity and severe risks .
were the problem simply to be a matter of the gross violation of the organization of american states ’ democratic charter – certified convincingly by oas secretary general luis almagro – solutions measured in months or years could have been considered . but venezuela is not merely a political problem ; there is a humanitarian disaster of unprecedented proportions . governments in both the americas and europe find themselves in a cogent , uncharted waters . true , venezuela ’s president nicolás maduro is ruling unconstitutionally , relying on emergency decrees and the all-powerful , one-party , illegally set constituent assembly while ignoring the elected national assembly and prohibiting opposition political parties . but the impact of his misrule is , such that venezuelans die from starvation , the health-care system has collapsed , and violence and contagious diseases are now practically beyond their control .
aside from the bjp ’s wholesale acceptance of twitter , modi ’s youthful chief minister of jammu and kashmir , regularly interacts on twitter , and his much elderly rajasthan and kerala counterparts , ashok gehlot , and oommen chandy , respectively , have leapt facebook accounts in the same breath . similarly , omar abdullah , india ’s youthful chief minister of jammu and kashmir , regularly interacts on twitter , and his much elderly rajasthan and kerala counterparts , ashok gehlot , and oommen chandy , respectively . but the pace at which the political world is embracing social media accelerated dramatically over the past year . chief minister of west bengal mamata banerjee announced the opening of facebook to receive and react to the public ’s questions . similarly , omar abdullah , the political world ’s youthful chief minister of jammu and kashmir , regularly interacts on twitter , and his much elder rajasthan and kerala ’s counterparts , ashok gehlot , and oommen chandy , respectively , respectively
so long as a country is internationally subordinated to the uncontrollable force of globalization , its future is in the hands of its new industries . but , in agreeing to open regional economies to imports , its poor and developing countries must be permitted to allow some means of protection of their new industries . related to it is the fact that , ultimately , nowadays , economic development depends less on a specific country and more on regional integration that can serve to avoid the adverse consequences of those financial speculations boosted by globalization . so long as a country is internationally subordinated to the uncontrollable forces of globalization : currency compatibility , free trade , shared the rule of law , and most of all common will be left to correct the rules of the game according to the region ’s whole . only that kind of equal cooperation can secure a solid political basis for integration .
is it fair to expect that egyptians would continue to pay for their past repression and impoverishment at the hands of mubarak and his cronies ? because this money had clearly benefited mubarak but not his people , should he not be mubarak rather than his victims who are held accountable ? is it fair to expect that egyptians would continue to pay for their past repression and impoverishment at the hands of mubarak and his cronies ? when egyptians went up against mubarak in january , they were confronted with guns paying for their borrowed money . a prudent lender was forced to weigh these facts before the loans had been made .
claims of alternative strategies must therefore be set at a somewhat lower level – say , the original exchange rate that might have been chosen to make east germany a very low wage country . even that is a dream since , in the face of high unemployment , east german wages have risen substantially every year relative to west germany . one alternative strategy , remotely conceivable , is that west germany would foresee the failure of its own experiment before embarking upon it . perhaps those are ideas en vogue in korea as it thinks of a possible reunification , but even there would be a hard time knowing when the time comes . at an even more depreciated conversion rate , the us would simply experience an increase in the wage rate of inflation .
and online platforms are facilitating increased consumption while expanding market-access opportunities and funding for smaller firms . china ’s leaders should aim to accelerate and build upon these trends , rather than pursue additional fiscal and monetary stimulus . public investment is high enough ; expanding it now would shift the composition of aggregate demand in the wrong direction . new firms in the service sector , $ 3.6 million of which were started just last year , are generating incremental jobs , thanks partly to a new streamlined licensing framework . and online platforms are facilitating increased consumption while expanding market access and funding for smaller firms .
faced with aggression from the kremlin , it is vital that poland and hungary abide by such groups have a fundamental set of values and principles . hungarians and poles must be reminded that russian president vladimir putin is actively trying to divide and weaken the eu and nato . but it also needs to be reminded that the eu itself is developing a more comprehensive mechanism for legitimating the rule of law within the union . one would be inconceivable for nato heads of state to go ahead with its planned leadership summit in warsaw in june , where poland remains mired in its constitutional crisis , with the government disregarding the rule of law , and views a respected international body . the eu has mechanisms to regulate economic policies , safeguard the environment , and police the single market .
many fear , with good reason , that fossil-fuel interests will exploit solar geoengineering to oppose emissions cuts . but that risk is hardly a sufficient reason to abandon or suppress research on solar geoengineering . at the same time , the overwhelming majority of those who are being researching solar geoengineering , or are advocating for its inclusion in climate-policy debates , are backing far stronger emissions-reduction action . many fear , with good reason , that fossil-fuel interests will exploit solar geoengineering to counter emissions cuts . yet most researchers are not driven by such interests .
instead , america has succumbed to the temptations of unilateralism . it is almost tempting to think that america ’s great cold war adversary , the soviet union , with its sudden disappearance from 15 years ago this month , has left its own trojan horse for america , the poisoned gift of unilateralism . to achieve this , america would have to understate its power to the goal of shaping the new order , much as it has done at the close of world war ii in 1945 . national greatness for a world power always arises from its power to shape the world . if a great power is to forgets this or lose the ability to act accordingly , the decline will begin .
that means engaging with sincerely with african governments to figure out how best to support domestic agendas for development and diversification . for their part , the industrialized economies must do more to support the african petroleum industry , and to ensure that the harmful effects of oil-producing power appear to be mitigated . the upcoming abu dhabi international petroleum show and a conference hosted by the abu dhabi national petroleum corporation of peru will participate in barkindo , along with numerous african energy ministers and oil-industry leaders , respectively , provides an ideal opportunity to initiate such a process . working with other stakeholders , campaigners for sustainable and just transition campaigners can also accomplish something more : allowing carbon energy to have a positive effect on economies that have so far experienced only the negative effects of twentieth-century oil-development . for such strategies to work , but for their part , the oil industry must get on board .
yet , though one-third of the west bank closed to the palestinians to make room for a few thousand jewish settlers , only 10 % of its largely rural population was refugees , a large number of them owned by their land , and a diverse range of jobs were made available . by contrast , 70 % of gaza ’s population comprised refugees living through difficult conditions within scores of refugee camps , and thus depended largely on work in israel . palestinians ’ access to egypt was restricted , and much of gaza ’s predominantly unskilled labor depended on the un relief works administration that built up and maintained local refugee camps . economic development in the gaza strip was limited under egyptian rule under egyptian rule , and the region suffered the burden of absorbing palestinian refugees fleeing the fighting in southern syria of mandatory palestine to later became israel . the 1967 war placed all of the compulsory palestine ( as it did with sinai and the golan ) under israeli military occupation .
when the financial crisis erupted , the same thinking may have crossed the minds of hank paulson , ben bernanke and tim geithner , america ’s treasury secretary , chairman of the us federal reserve bank and president of the new york fed , respectively . after world war ii , the same thought may have crossed the minds of hank paulson , ben bernanke , and tim geithner , who was america ’s treasury secretary , chairman of the us federal reserve bank , and president of the new york fed , respectively . now a decade later , three of them have co-authored what could be drafted as a version of the 2.1 of that episode in history . all three published lengthy memoirs explain why they have done , and have not done what they had and do not do – inevitably with degree of self-justifying in each case . now , a decade later , the three have co-authored what one might describe as a version of 2.1 of that episode in history .
in this sense , east asia ’s economies embraced the process of “ creative destruction , ” described by the austrian economist joseph schumpeter , whereby economic structures were continually revolutionized from within . similarly , in the 1990s , when china addressed the buildup of bad debt and unfinished construction projects , the result of state-owned enterprises ( soes ) of chronic loss-making and excessive property investment , respectively , by implementing institutional reforms that stimulated growth in an increasingly dynamic sector , offsetting soes ’ falling returns on capital . in this sense , east asia ’s economies embraced the process of “ creative destruction , ” described in part by the growth of the nonfarm sector , the result of policies designed to stimulating township and village enterprises . moreover , by implementing incremental reforms that facilitate – and even encourage – replacing old , inefficient sources of growth with the new , more dynamic ones , expedited that process . the goal was not to redress the problems they faced directly , but to induce new , more efficient activities that would help turn debt into assets and maximize usage of an economy ’s capacity .
brussels – as the protests over china ’s crackdown in tibet , and the debate over kosovo ’s unilateral declaration of independence continues to fester , the injustice of taiwan ’s continuing international isolation has barely stirred a flicker of concern , despite taiwan ’s recent presidential election and a referendum on the united nations membership . similarly , much of the world is protesting in the name of tibet , owing to the fact that countless millions have witnessed china ’s brutal suppression of tibetan culture . this neglect is not only shortsighted ; it can also prove dangerous . taiwan , by contrast , does not capture our attention because it is stable and flourishing economically . this seeming dual standard may be explained partly by a sense of guilt : the west has , for the most part , embraced kosovo ’s independence in an effort to assuage its own culpability for not preventing slobodan milosevic from campaigning for ethnic cleansing there .
a second change for the better would , i hope , be much less controversial : cut the power bestowed at the uk on non-elected special advisors or spads , who has now become dominant figures within all of the government departments . throughout my 17-month experience as our secretary of state , i have become convinced that spads ’ overstrength , and haughty access , undermines the uk ’s enormously excellent civil-service service , as well as elected and appointed ministers . may ’s two chief spads , fiona hill and nick timothy , have taken on this danger to worrying levels . many are now eagerly offering their views on whether the uk should look anew at the “ norway model ” of its relations with the eu , or some other scheme that maintains uk participation in the single market . whatever the options , it is now clear that britain needs a policy that can command broad and genuine support .
it would be naive to imagine that nanotechnology can evolve with no risk to our health and environment . setting aside the question of the nanomaterials ’ toxicity , preliminary outcomes suggest that fabricating nanomaterials entails risks that are smaller than they are comparable to those associated with many current industrial activities . indeed , many of the ingredients used to make nanomaterials are currently known to current human health risks . setting aside matters relating to the nanomaterials ’ toxicity , preliminary results suggest that fabricating nanomaterials entails risks taking less than or comparable risk to those associated with many current industrial activities . while efforts to halt the development of the anti-nanomal-inspired technology would be as irresponsible as it is unrealistic , responsible development of such technologies demands vigilance and social dedication .
today , nearly 4.5 billion people have internet access , and around one in three internet users are under the age of 18 . would-be traffickers need only a laptop or smartphone with high-speed internet connectivity to move into business . would-be traffickers need only a laptop or a smartphone with high-speed internet connectivity to move into business . today , nearly 4.5 billion people have internet access , and around one in three internet users , just under the age of 18 , is continuously anticipated . would-be traffickers need only laptop or smartphone with high-speed internet connectivity to move into business .
it should not come as a surprise that the euro began to slide against the dollar contemplating the country ’s disparities in economic performance between america and europe . indeed , the recent intervention and us support from america and japan demonstrated that europe is here to stay , and that markets are convinced of its success . we all owe it to the euro to be a hard but promising start . and it should not come as a surprise that markets have tested european political leaders ’ willingness to stay silent where monetary matters . for their part , the euro has experienced a hard but promising start .
people learned that it pays to buy dips , and were not weaned off a habit until it stopped paying off . now that internet fever has abated , we hear that the “ fundamentals ” are reasserting itself . but this view is as absolute truth as the previous notion that the boom would last , forever , because the internet economy created new fundamentals . indeed , the internet ’s boom/bust cycle is bringing into question prevailing economic theories about financial markets . what , then , should be obvious today is that so-called fundamentals , which supposedly determine stock prices , are reasserting themselves .
palo alto – since the development of toxicology in the sixteenth century , its guiding principle has been that “ the dose makes the poison . ” the right dose can be a therapeutic godsend , but consuming too much of it can be fatal . the risk that some substance poses broadly rests on two factors : its intrinsic capacity to cause harm , and one ’s exposure to it . the right dose makes it broadly dependent on two factors : its intrinsic capacity to cause harm , and one that ’s exposure to it . it is a rule that applies to the medicines used by patients worldwide many billions of times per day .
given libya ’s lack of democratic experience , some view this as the likely outcome of the post-qaddafi era . but libya is not the only country that has struggled to shift from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identity . albania , mongolia , and india have successfully passed out more complicated tests – offering some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavorable conditions . cyrenaica is qaddafi-free , tripolitania is not , and fezzan has not fully joined the revolution . the fourth scenario is partition , with old three-province , ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : cyrenaica ( the east ) , fezzan ( south ) , and tripolitania ( the west ) .
they argue that the ecb ’s quantitative easing by itself , with no fiscal relaxation , would have been ineffective . but they also stress a crucial question : how will quantitative easing stimulate the economy ? giavazzi and tabellini ’s proposals may entail too big a stimulus . they are proposing tax cuts that are equal to 5 % of gdp for 3-4 years across all eurozone countries , financed by very long-term public debt – all of which the ecb is set to purchase . the bank of england has presented qe as a pure monetary-policy tool that sustains economic growth in the face of necessary and desirable fiscal consolidation .
standard & poor ’s has received some justified criticism for the analysis behind its recent decision to downgrade america ’s government debt ; after all , there was little economic news that could explain the move ’s timing . but s & p ’s assessment of the political situation is on target : creating dysfunctional paralysis at the heartland of the government , the tea party has proved willing to impose dramatic costs on the broader economy and to ensure substantially slower growth . and the tone of political debate , not surprisingly , has become much nastier . confrontations and brinkmanship have become new watchwords of american politics , even as america ’s government ’s fundamental ability to pay its debts is on a par with the tea party ’s ideological rigidities . never mind that eye-popping growth projections in representative paul ryan of the us budget plan , for example , are entirely implausible ; those projections matter politically , because , without them , the full sting of the proposed medicare cuts would readily apparent .
on trade , trump and xi agreed to a 100-day plan for discussion on reducing america ’s trade deficit with china . on trade , trump and xi had agreed to a 100-day plan for discussions on closing the american trade deficit with china . both appeared to recognize that a stable us-china relationship was essential to enable them to focus on their respective challenges . moreover , the us embraced china as a way to revamp the framework for bilateral engagement by creating the us-china comprehensive dialogue , consisting of four softer terms : diplomacy and security , economic issues , law enforcement , and cybersecurity , as well as social and cultural issues . trump , for his part , embraced xi ’s invitation to visit china early .
against this backdrop , efforts to tame the deep-seated sunni-shia rivalry ( by , for example , improving relations between saudi arabia and iran ) , though undoubtedly important , should not take priority over a strategy aimed at addressing sectarianism plaguing the sunni gulf . that strategy must center on federalism , and it must be . the uae and qatar have already instituted a compulsory military service to adult males . had federalism in somalia been introduced , for example , when the north-south rift emerged , it probably would not have ended as a failed state . and kuwait is considering following in jordan ’s footsteps by reintroducing conscription already in most sunni states ( as well as iran ) .
the left ’s yearning for peace is perceived as naïve , if not an exercise in political lunacy ( and in either case an unpardonable betrayal of jewish identity ) . the left ’s own yearning for peace is perceived as naïve , if not an exercise in political lunacy ( and in either case an unpardonable betrayal of jewish identity ) . israeli elections are in some ways the tribal affair ; people vote on the basis of memories , insults , religious sensibilities , and group grievances . netanyahu has positioned himself as a magnet for fear and advanced xes of a wide array of aggrieved voters , including russian immigrants , orthodox jews , most traditionalist israelis , and religious settlers . israeli elections are in some ways the tribal affair ; people vote based on memories , insults , religious sensibilities , and group grievances .
but there is little question that protecting – and even enhancing – women ’s jobs and income prospects will require upgrading their skills in order to seize the new and changed opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution . according to mgi research , more than 100 million jobs could be created during the next 10-15 years as health-care and education need to grow . women ’s success in e-commerce attests to the strength of digital technologies to level the economic playing field , to the benefit of individual women , their communities , and their societies , and to the global economy . moreover , among the new jobs that will emerge will be created , many in fields such as education and health care , where women have traditionally thrived . it is not yet clear how automation will affect women ’s employment .
russia had conquered muslim territories in the volga-ural region , the caucasus , and central asia , brutally repressing any opposition . with little short-lived exceptions , however , the government enacted a more pragmatic policy . indeed , russia ’s links with the muslim world went back thousands of years , rooted in a tradition of tolerance . until the tsarist 19th century , sedentary muslim elites collaborated to an imperial aristocracy , just when it was absorbed in the 20th century by national communist elites into the soviet nomenclatura . with little short-lived exceptions , russian imperial rule failed to encourage orthodox evangelism .
hong kong has experienced an unprecedented 17 weeks of mostly peaceful demonstrations ( occasional episodes of violence have attracted disproportionate media attention ) . the trigger was the proposed extradition law , which many feared would expand the mainland ’s reach into hong kong ’s politicized judicial system . the absence of any plan for bringing together diverse protest groups , and hong kong ’s government , has become a source of mounting concern . such a plan would have to do at least two things . first , every party ( including china ’s central government in this case ) needs to recommit to the “ one country , two systems ” framework .
to address this distortion head on , and to provide clarity about resource allocation , the egf should direct its scarce funds on two fairly active labor market programs : wage insurance and mobility allowance . the allowance of such a narrowly focused approach is also clear : margin of choice for eu members about how the egf funds are to be spent in their home country would be minuscule . wage insurance could offer workers whose pay was slashed after an displacement compensation for up to two years amounting to half the difference between old and new wages . the very simplicity of such a scheme will likely ensure the high visibility and reasonable take-up rate . wage insurance could offer workers whose pay was cut after an displacement compensation for up to two years amounting to one-half of the difference between old and new wage .
to be sure , the rise of asia ’s middle class is not the only change that we should expect . but kharas ’s projection suggests , asia will account for about two-thirds of the world ’s middle class by 2030 . in other words , what asia will displace does not just the west , but even the other emerging regions . to be sure , this is the true kind of business opportunity that asia ’s middle class represents . as it stands , asia ’s share has been 28 % ( after which it was including japan ) .
nonetheless , the challenge that these new parties are posing to europe could prove to be singularly disruptive . a greek exit from the eurozone , combined with financial and political turmoil inside greece , would be perceived as a major defeat for european integration , particularly after the laborious efforts have made it to hold together a monetary union , and , with it , the european dream . such an outcome would become even more disheartening in light of the tragic terror attacks in paris , and after unity marches in france and across the continent rekindled a long-fading sense of european solidarity . populist parties , on both the far right and the far left , are gaining electoral gains . such an outcome would be even more disheartening in light of the tragic terror attacks in paris , and after unity marches in france and across the continent rekindled a long-fading sense of european solidarity .
taken together , all of these deficiencies cast serious doubt on the eu ’s claims to be at the forefront of the debate over a fundamental reshaping of global economic governance . european governments are only now reluctantly accepting the need to scale back their over-representation in multilateral bodies , recognizing that it undermines , rather than enhances , the eu ’s overall influence by pushing other powers to separate arrangements . but , while deliberation prevails over how much europe should retreat from its historic domination of multilateral bodies , there is little vision beyond this . indeed , when europeans think of reforming global governance , they limit themselves to numbers of seats and voting weights in international actors . european governments are repeating the mantra of effective multilateralism , ” ” ” ” it seems that they have no comprehensive strategy for translating this into a coherent policy .
são paulo – a decades-old legal fight between consumers and financial institutions over the impact of brazil ’s money on economic policies of the 1980s and 1990s is approaching . during the late 1980s and early 1990s , the brazilian government was struggling to stabilize the country ’s economy and the currency . in december , lawyers representing claimants presented brazil ’s supreme federal court , with a request to ratify the settlement that had been reached with the banks . if the court eventually approves the deal , a settlement would pile billions of reals to the pockets of savers . but , more than a long-awaited payday for some one million claimants , court-ordered restitution would also mark the official end of brazil ’s seemingly inexorable war on hyperinflation .
one measure of this deficiency is borrowing rates ; in east africa , where my organization works ; in east africa , where my organization works ; women borrow about 13 % less farm-related money than men do . these barriers have had a dramatic impact on social and economic progress . but , in many cases , this has not translated into greater control over the finances . women today dominate african agriculture , a continent of the most important industry in the world . illiteracy , limited land ownership , and agency restrictions all of conspire to reduce rural women ’s access to farm financing .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for several decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . the modi government ’s supporters tout some slew of new repressive legislation , including the criminalization of talaq-e-biddat , muslim practices of instant divorce ” , as a display of resoluteness .
one solution is to channel around the liquidity injections toward countering this factor-cost asymmetry . liquidity injections and low interest rates have a microeconomic effect , which has received little attention : they reduce capital costs for labor costs , which could be particularly potent in economies with flexible labor markets , which enables short-term hiring . as a result , for every $ 100 of new liquidity , the us could use up to $ 60 to buy assets and the remainder to give marginal job-creation subsidies , which could be particularly efficient in economies with flexible labor markets , which allow for short-term hiring . even if employment subsidies were offered only for , say , one year , firms would be tempted to use more labor during this period . that is very likely to exacerbate the us unemployment problem ; it is certainly not mitigating it .
what is clear is that the experiences of countries that implemented the treaty were not particularly positive when they gained these countries ’ high tolerance for bureaucratic regulatory regimes that stifle innovation and development in the name of lofty aspiration . it is over-wrought , bewildering , and complex – in a short time , inimical to innovations that could have benefited the world ’s poor . the seed treaty is being cut out from the same anti-capitalist , anti-science , an anti-innovation cloth as the convention for biological diversity ( cbd ) . and it has much in common with the asat nagoya-kuala lumpur supplementary protocol on accountability and redress to the cartagena powerful protocol – yet another anti-genetic-engineering screed , which accomplishes little except to frighten potential entrepreneurs away from agricultural biotechnology . it also mirrors the flagrantly unscientific , anti-genetic-engineering protocol on biosafety to the cbd .
madrid – beleaguered by the anti-global reactions of both the left and the right , it was thus a triple divide , between anti-globalization conservatives , pro-globalization liberals , and the re-distributionist leftists . for much of the post-1945 era , those divisions vanished as right and left fought battles for redistribution within national economies . “ there is , ” he wrote in an echo of today ’s globalization debates , “ some circumstances capitalistically disorganized economies in which greater cultures are not victorious but rather loses in an existential struggle with lower cultures . ” for much of the post-1945 period , those divisions vanished as they did in the interwar period – the anti-international right had moved toward fascism , the left to communism – democratic politics became paralyzed . “ there is , ” he wrote in the echo of today ’s globalization debates , “ some situational ” capitalistically disorganized economies in which a higher culture is not victorious but rather loses in an existential struggle with lower cultures .
but the veil that exists over the way that the omnipotent party makes important decisions has been lifted somewhat because of a volume of unique material about the behind-the-scenes events surrounding the infamous tiananmen square massacre of 1989 . the materials contained in that book that i brought out of china and chose to make public are , consist of hundreds of documents , including the minutes and transcripts at which high-level leaders in people ’s forebears deliberating on how to manage tienanmen demonstrations ; key speeches ; notes on crucial telephone conversations among leaders ; and dispatches from security agencies ; and dispatches from the police and the military . taken as an present and participant in tiananmen events , and as someone with access to an historic archive , i feel my obligation to publish this track of rulings that lay behind what has been so far . the chinese leadership ’s penchant for secretiveness comes out , and it seems proverbial . taken as a whole , those documents provide a rare glimpse into china ’s modus operandi .
in the 1970s , for example , slovakia , like other communist states , was dreary , oppressive , joyless , where mediocre party hacks set the tone , and creativity stifled beneath a blanket of enforced conformism . recordings through the rolling stones and other western groups were banned . rock and roll was seen as a dirigiste form of capitalist decadence . a locally rock band named plastic people of the universe , performing in english , was sacked at the turn of the 1970s in the early 1970s for the practice of peace . and yet records were smuggled into slovakia and other eastern european countries , where treasured young rock fans , including the dissident playwright václav havel , who would later become the country ’s president .
there is , of course , an appealing rationale for saying that governments should have to balance their budgets just like the rest of us ; sadly , this is no less straightforward matter . certainly , there is an appealing rationale for saying that governments should have to balance their budgets just like the rest of us ; unfortunately , this is no less straightforward . after all , governments typically have myriad ongoing spending commitments related to basic services like national defense , infrastructure projects , aid to education , and health care , not to mention to pensioners . no government can simply walk away from these responsibilities overnight . the debt-ceiling absolutists underestimate the massive adjustment costs of a knee-jerk exit in debt finance .
take iraq , where the looming “ shia crescent ” is often blamed for much of the mayhem . while this perception may persuade at first sight , it is ultimately based on generalizations revealing more about its proponents than actual realities on the ground . take iraq , where the looming “ shia crescent ” is often blamed for much of the mayhem . president hosni mubarak of egypt , for example , argues that shiites are “ always loyal to iran , ” while jordan ’s king abdullah has exaggerated the axiom of the rising “ shiite crescent ” in the region . ironically , this perception has brought israel some , if anything , rather unlikely partners on the ground .
it does n’t help that the financial institutions in china funneled at least $ 1 billion into “ green ” finance to coal-related projects in the first half of this year . firms can not keep producing oil , gas , and internal combustion engines while gradually shifting to cleaner technology ; they need a clean break . as matters stand , coal , oil , and gas could still supply 85 % of their primary energy use by 2040 , down only slightly from the 90 % that today . to complete the shift away from fossil fuels will require drilling for the core of the global economy . firms can not keep producing oil , gas , and internal combustion engines while gradually shifting to cleaner technology ; they need a clean break .
indeed , unlike in 2002 , when the farc could make impossible demands on the government today favors the state , forcing the rebels to retain their demands realistic . as a result , armed conflict becomes increasingly expensive for the rebels . the agenda will focus on ending the conflict , without making endless debates about theoretical or doctrinaire questions . indeed , indeed , unlike in 2002 , when the farc could make impossible demands on the government today favors the state , forcing the rebels to hold them realistic demands . the farc is unlikely to stage a media spectacle at the meetings in norway and cuba .
the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) remains intact , as do trade relations with china and other key american partners . but it is also another area , where obama has set the bar high during his two terms . the most positive note that can be said about trump ’s ’s ’s ’s first year in economic policymaking is that he has not delivered on his campaign promise to disrupt trade . the administration has imposed tariffs in january on solar panels and washing machines ; but those are small relative to the size of the us economy . yes , this is a volatile data series , for it is rising and falling with the usual pattern of events .
but southeast asians are not immune to this kind of nonsense , either . perhaps this is how jewish conspiracy theories have been passed on to the same day . all these books are contingencies about the protocols of the elders of zion , a “ forgery ” for the first time published in 1903 , which japan arrived after its defeating the czars in 1905 . malaysia ’s former prime minister , mahathir bin mohammed , said that “ jews rule the world through a proxy . ” the chinese , for their part , picked up many modern western thoughts from the jsdf .
it needs not only closer economic ties but also closer political ties . they will have to give them an answer to a strong european parliament . italy needs not only closer economic ties but also closer political ties . german chancellor angela merkel ’s own constituents hate bailouts because they know that it is bailing out bailing out italy . they oppose anything that is likely to smacks of european political integration .
new york – striving to revive the world economy while simultaneously responding to the global climate crisis upended a knotty question : are statistics giving us the right “ signals ” about what to do ? in our performance-oriented world , measurement issues have taken the form of heightened relevance : what we measure affects what we do . we may also be confronted with false choices , seeing the trade-offs between output and the environmental protection that do not exist . if we have the wrong measures , what we are trying to do ( say , increasing gdp ) may actually actually contribute to a deteriorating standard of living . a better measure of economic performance , on the other hand , may show that steps taken to improve the environment are good for the economy .
bangkok – friend recently asked a apparently naïve question : “ what is money ? what is money ? we are now learning in introductory economics that money is a medium of exchange . its banknotes are only pieces of paper , with some attached . how is i able to trust that it is worth what it says worth ?
sometimes , however , even sacred cows must be slaughtered . when this was first made in 1985 , the schengen area included a mere five countries ( belgium , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , and west germany ) . with the refugee crisis turning schengen into a threat to the eu ’s credibility as a collective entity , and to its national governments ’ capacity to maintain order and the rule of law , that time is now . eu membership has since ballooned to include the 22 of the eu ’s five member countries – with four of those left out ( bulgaria , croatia , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , and romania – owing to join in the forward-looking – plus the four non-eu members ( norway , iceland , switzerland , and liechtenstein ) . to be sure , the idea of abolishing borders within europe holds great symbolic significance and appeal .
at the same time , he realizes the power of his kremlin aides as well . he simply wants the oligarchs to stick to their sphere of activity , leaving politics out for him . no doubt , putin nowadays seems to behave like a peacemaker . for him , he has no interest in reinforcing the power of his kremlin aides . but the issue will not go away .
though the world ’s attention nowadays is fixed on the risks of an escalating sino-american trade war , the threat of an equally destructive transatlantic conflict can no longer be ignored . the danger now is that political uncertainty in germany , france , italy , and the uk will produce an opening for populists and self-proclaimed “ illiberal ” democrats like hungarian prime minister viktor orbán to build more royals ( physically like metaphorically ) and mobilize the ghosts of nationalism . moreover , europe ’s external environment has become more dangerous than ever . was it supposed to celebrate one morning , and decide to impose heavy import tariffs on european cars , things could get very ugly , very fast . moreover , trump seems genuinely convinced that german cars in the streets of new york poses an opening to us national security .
a bank with a thin margin and limited liability has little to lose and will tend to gamble , a bias that is exacerbated by deposit insurance and its too-big-to-fail policies . in fact , greater competitive pressure can increase the fragility of banks ’ balance sheets , making investors ever more prone to panics . the result will be more incentives to assume risk factors . beyond the regional crisis , there is a trade-off between competition and stability . it can also erode the value of institutions .
vaccines have already eradicated smallpox and the dramatically reduced child deaths and diseases associated with measles , diphtheria , and tetanus . yet , sad yet , the world has yet to take action . most live in poor and remote communities that continue to lack access to essential vaccines that are universally available in better-off countries . this is one reason why a high-income child in a high-income country is 18 times less likely than a low-income child to die before reaching their age of five . fortunately , however , the world is taking action once again .
and , because a child believes that everyone operates under his particular definitions of the right and the wrong kind , he can not comprehend that someone else may see things differently . as the pioneering baby psychologist jean piaget showed , infants in their early stages of development follow a phase of egocentrism : they naturally concentrate on their own needs and do not think part of the policy . to the infant mind , it ’s not up to the wrong ; the world is simply under-briefed . a child might snatch of another child ’s ’s toy , break it , and then deny having done so . rather than admit to breaking the rules , they lie in coordinating one another .
its greatest shortcoming is its lack of roads , bridges , ports , and other infrastructure , where the contrast with china is only stunning . it is this difference , more than anything else that sets the two economies apart . unless your products can access the global economy as a whole , you can not conquer . it is this difference , more than anything else that sets the two economies apart . over the last five years , china has multiplied a five-fold highway system .
nowadays , there are two types of populists : exploitative and enlightened . in an environment of ignorance , populist politicians make willing prey on those who feel ignored . but , because those politicians are so appealing to so many , they , no less than easily swayed voters , must become scrutinized . the issue is whether a brand of politics that threatens liberal democracy may also be reformulated to save it . the critical thinking has become increasingly dismissed as an elitist endeavor , while unaccountable social media , “ fake news , ” ” ” ” ” and “ alternative realities ” dominate public debate .
a recent feature that stands out over this period of historically slow productivity growth has been weak demand . throughout industries , slow recovery in demand following the financial crisis has been key to holding back investment . a mgi survey , for example , conducted last year , found that 47 % of firms increase their investment budgets did so because of increased demand or rising expectations . the crisis heightened uncertainty about the future course of consumer growth and investment demand . we know from corporate decision-makers that there is a critical mass of demand for investment .
here is a country that has long cherished its “ exception ” from conventional rules of market economics , an foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets , and claims to offer a well-balanced middle ground . the french no longer care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a “ third way , ” ” ” ” ” for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets to defend “ higher ” values from the single-minded pursuit of materialism . that view , having spread since world war ii by a quasi-marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the french do not even bother to comprehend how markets operate . they look upon economics as an ideological battleground , where all views can be entertained without being confronted with rationalist , far less with the facts . yet the facts have been dealt with in a hard time .
health care and social security already consume half of america ’s federal budget , up from its one-sixth in 1965 , and those outlays relative to gdp are projected to more than twofold . avoiding this outcome will require america ’s political leaders to constrain the growth of entitlement spending and to spur support among middle-income individuals . for example , to ensure that nobody working for 30 or more years will live in old-age poverty , social security needs a higher minimum wage for lower-income workers , with more affluent seniors seeing less growth in benefits over time . while social security and medicare remain vital to ensure wellbeing in their retirement , their role must be updated to suit today ’s needs . while social security and medicare remain essential to securing the wellbeing of their retirement , their roles must be updated to suit them today .
new york -- president george w. bush was correct to call pakistan the most recent national and provincial elections “ a victory for [ its ] people . ” collectively , they voted against musharraf and religious extremists , and in favor of democracy , the rule of law , as well as good governance . but , even as he articulated these words , his administration worked behind the scenes to defeat pakistan ’s will by seeking to dictate the composition of its next coalition government and prop up the election ’s largest loser , president general pervez musharraf . millions of pakistanis delivered a clear message at the polls . bush is playing a dangerous game , risking pakistan ’s implosion of its political process to contain its own legacy .
it evades the immune system fast , so the body ’s natural capacity to fight , or clear , is limited . moreover , long-term treatments are not the same thing as a remedy , and no tool of public-health tools ( in addition to clean drinking water ) has ever matched the preventive power of an entire vaccine . at the same time , three of five hiv-positive individuals are not receiving an antiretroviral therapy , and no treatment for them at all . in parts of the world , hiv is , in many cases , an extremely complex virus . it mutates rapidly within the individual and among the country ’s geographic location , established latent reservoirs within the cells that can emerge and replicate months , or even years later .
according to this argument , academic researchers should either publish their research openly or leave the university before pursuing commercial interests . similarly , the universities which employ them should abandon product development to existing companies . but it is useful to remember that the university was accused of subverting its own ideals and social role ever since time immemorial , yet what in the past initially looked to many like a conflict of interest often came to be declared confluence of purposes . for example , during the late 19 th century , as american universities began their research at the heart of their academic mission , they were accused of forsaking their traditional pedagogical role . many professors argued that research claims would render their teaching obligations impossible to fulfill .
brussels – throughout the crisis , the european central bank ’s behavior has conditioned the tension between what it can do and what it has been allowed to do . the ecb is the only institution in the european union that offers unlimited financing to governments , but its governing statute prohibits government bailouts . yet the ecb has channeled massive amounts of liquidity into the financial system , indirectly softening the pressure on the country ’s sovereign-debt refinancing . it has bought up government bonds for 18 months , worth more than € 200 billion ( $ 254 billion ) on secondary markets , under its securities market program . moreover , it has delivered loans to the banking sector , most recently launching a three-year refinancing operation that has generated demand from eurozone banks up to € 489 billion .
america would have faced these problems even if it did not simultaneously face a financial crisis . the bush administration failed to see the problems coming , denied the difficulty when it came , then minimized its significance and , finally , panicked . excessive leveraging , combined with bad lending and risky derivatives , caused credit markets to freeze . the bush administration failed to see the problems coming , denied the difficulties that were coming when it arrived , then minimized its significance and , finally , panicking . after all , when banks are unaware of their own balance sheets , they are not about to trust others ’ .
recognizing these benefits , myanmar has put education at the heart of its reform agenda worldwide . as former south korean education minister and commission member lee myung-bak remarked during our visit , teaching young people to think critically about their own time , but the results can have powerful knock-on effects for a rural knowledge-based economy . vietnam and south korea are offering inspiring examples for countries transforming their education systems within a generation . one priority – to improve inclusivity , for example , is already being underway . for example , the government currently is working to encourage instruction in more local languages , over 100 are said in myanmar , the rural areas .
but what if economists ’ compensation assumed in theory wo n’t happen in practice ? in that case , pareto optimality is not socially optimal . the eu has policies that exacerbate competition , whether in business , labor markets , or domestic production , can be socially destructive and politically explosive . and yet , what if market-fundamentalist politics explicitly forbids income redistribution or regional , industrial , and education subsidies that could compensate those who suffer from free trade and labor-market “ flexibility ” ? in the case of the case , pareto optimality is not socially optimal .
madrid – economic globalization , combined with a rebalancing of power among the world ’s north and south , has made developing countries and many companies within them key global economic actors . this provides a new rationale for strengthening the international investment regime , and should broaden interest in developing a more efficient investment-protection framework . once upon a time , global foreign direct investment ( fdi ) has flowed out of only a few sources : the traditionally affluent states of europe , north america , and japan . but cross-border investment from countries like brazil , india , and china is now flowing not only to other emerging and transitional economies , but also to the old fdi-exporting states . such changes have heightened the complexity of the international investment regime , and should broaden interest in developing a more efficient investment-protection framework .
the worry now is that information technology is on the bend of a “ hockey stick ” curve , where it will suddenly take off at far more speeds than it did before . left to its own devices , the computers and the internet have made it possible to send information almost costlessly , and to do business across cultures and continents . the resulting changes wo n’t all be welcome in an economic fashion . the worry now is that information technology is on the bend to the “ hockey stick ” curve , where it will suddenly take off at far more speeds than it has in the past . the resulting pace of change will often occur in nature , not in the future .
copenhagen – amid a rising wave of concern about climate change , many countries – including brazil , australia , the united states , and sweden – passed laws in the 2000 ’s ’s ’s outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs . but it ’s a point of taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to address global warming . the intention was understandable : if everyone in the world exchanged mostly light bulbs for the energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs ( cfls ) , we could save 3.5 % of all electricity , or 1 % of our co2 emissions . many contend that this agenda is being propelled by knuckle-dragging of climate-change deniers . republican leaders ’ current attempt to roll back america ’s effort to ban incandescent bulbs revived this discussion .
the key to boosting these gains , according to the iadb , is to adopt a new strategy that expands access across and within markets . this indicates that for the uk , mega-regional trade agreements that provide access to multiple markets , but that entail lower levels of fiscal and regulatory integration than the eu is the best way forward . after all , it is this approach , which will enable uk firms to take a position in well-developed and integrated supply chains , serving a much larger market than those that a bilateral agreement would ensure them access . the inter-american development bank , for example , reports that the trade gains from latin american countries have been meager . the key to boosting those gains , according to the iadb , is to adopt a new strategy that expands access both to and within markets .
the provision of high-quality basic services like education and health care is viewed as crucial for achieving equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility . for starters , public-sector investment is broadly below the levels needed to restore and sustain growth , in part owing to fiscal constraints in an overly indebted country . on the other hand , income inequality that is not an too extreme , and that does not emerge from corruption or privileged access to markets , is being understood and embraced . against this backdrop , one can examine current growth patterns in the global economy and its different segments . growth patterns that systematically exclude subgroups founder on loss of political and social cohesion , and ultimately on loss of support for such a strategy .
if the rule of law is to be upheld , democratic self-defense must not be shown to appear ad hoc or arbitrary . there is less consensus about parties inciting hatred and committed to dismantling core democratic principles , especially because many extremist parties in europe go out of their way to emphasize being not anti-democracy ; on the contrary , are fought on behalf of “ the people . ” one criterion that appears universally accepted is a party to exploit , encouragement , or at least condoning violence – as was probably the case with golden dawn in attacking immigrants in athens . thus , the brexiteers ’ criteria should be delineated in advance . for starters , it is important to recognize that lines need to become unambiguously visible before extremist parties even emerge .
for them , patriotism means harder-aimed at protecting the national interest and adopting more social policies that help the working masses , rather than the jet-setting fat cats . a democracy in which the majority feels neglected or exploited is unsustainable . elected officials clearly need to find answers to high unemployment and falling living standards . for them , patriotism means harder-going efforts to protect the national interest and adopt more democratic policies that help the working masses , rather than the jet-setting fat cats . elected officials obviously need to find answers to high unemployment and falling living standards .
while official us figures show overall import prices down 11 % in the 12 months through august , this is almost entirely the result of lower energy costs . so , on an overall trade-weighted basis , the renminbi is substantially larger relative to the currencies that it competes . even more relevant , the decline in the renminbi and other currencies during the last year has had very little effect on american import prices , because chinese and other exporters are priced out of dollars , and do n’t adjust when exchange-rate changes . more important , wealth , and consumption in china are intimately related to real-estate values , not equity values . finally , the renminbi ’s recent decline against the us dollar was just 2.5 % , from cn ¥ 6.2 % in the 12 months through august , far below the double-digit declines in the japanese yen , the euro , and the british pound .
so , while we can expect the multi-year process of rebalancing and closing the gap between actual and potential growth , precisely how long it will take depends on policy choices and the speed of structural adjustment . in any of the many cases with which i am familiar , effective leadership was the catalyst . in southern europe , for example , the process will last longer , because there are more missing components to recovery in those countries . there is nothing automatic about this . so , while we can expect the multi-year process of rebalancing and closing the gap between actual and potential growth , precisely how long it takes depends on policy choices and on accelerating structural adjustment .
but the belarusian economic model can not survive , with the us trade deficit forecast to exceed $ 7 trillion ( 14 % of gdp ) this year . like spain in a dictator last years , a political opening is unlikely . finally , the eu should work to francoize belarus . belarus can not borrow enough to cover it . as with spain under franco , belarus ’s economy will change before lukashenka does , laying the basis for rapid development as soon as he is gone .
at the same time , asian n-11 countries like the philippines and vietnam have grown significantly since 2005 , while mexico ’s performance has been rather disappointing , with egypt even more so . finally , these countries have extremely heterogeneous economic and social conditions and very different levels of wealth . for example , south koreans now enjoy a standard of living similar to that in the european union , which makes many analysts ’ persistent categorization of south korea ’s economy as an “ emerging economy ” has ” all the more baffling . meanwhile , mexico ’s and turkey ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s wealth levels have come anywhere near that of south korea , and yet remain significantly wealthier than the rest of the n-11 ’s , some remain among the world ’s poorest countries . collectively , asian n-11 comprises some 1.5 billion people and its current nominal gdp stands at around $ 6.5 trillion .
turkey ’s recent invasion of northern syria , owing to its betrayal of the kurds who have spearheaded the struggle against the islamic state ( isis ) , has also undercut eu interests . on both sides of the atlantic , populist politicians have regularly mock the notion of an alliance based on shared values , while china and russia continue to broaden their spheres of influence unchecked . far from the aberration , trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s trade wars and betrayal of its allies represent a new norm for global order . for the first time since world war ii , europe finds itself without a notable ally or partner . multilateralism , human rights , and respect for international law are now under threat everywhere , owing to demagogic attacks on liberal-democratic principles and trump ’s open backing of authoritarians .
comparatively few europeans seem to question the moral obligation of accepting the asylum-seeking refugees fleeing from syria ’s civil war , or of political oppression elsewhere . whether or not public sentiment is changing in the wake of the paris attacks , economic migrants are viewed with greater negative consequences . he forecasts that labor shortages create a cap that restricts annual gdp growth to 1.8 % in the years ahead , and a mere 1.3 % from then until 2050 . comparatively few europeans seem to question the moral obligation of accepting the asylum-seeking refugees fleeing in syria of civil war , or of political oppression elsewhere . taken together , he seems to question the moral obligation of accepting the refugees fleeing syria ’s civil war or political oppression elsewhere .
and yet no international treaty covers climate-induced migration – a gap that must now be tackled . not since 1951 has international refugee standards received so much attention . according to the international organization for migration , climate change could displace as many as one billion people every year by 2050 . and yet no international treaty covers climate-induced migration – a gap that must now be addressed . according to the international organization for migration , climate change could displace so much attention .
lukyanivska , kyiv , has been rumored to have no atheists in a foxhole . here , after my show trial and four and a half months in a cell , i have discovered that no atheists are currently in jail , either . here , after my show trial and four and a half months in a cell , the loneliness of a prison cell is almost unbearable . god , one realizes is one ’s only friend and only affordable family , because – deprived even of access to a trusted priest – there is none else in whom to confide one ’s concerns and hopes . when , despite unbearable pain , you are being interrogated – including in your cell – for dozens of hours with no break , and an authoritarian regime in its entire system of coercion , including its media , attempting to discredit and destroy you once and for all , prague becomes the sole intimate , trusting , and reassuring conversation that one may have .
and some donors , such as france , germany , and the european investment bank , are lobbying oecd development assistance committee member countries to count unsubsidized loans as official development aid funds allow them to meet their oda targets . but education , a critical public good , should not be left behind in pursuing non-grant-based aid . this reverses the trend over recent decades of an grant-based funding , especially for elementary education . loan buy-downs can help keep donors of the education sector systemically vital , ” and could show a mechanism to leverage the extra resources for education , for which capital-strapped countries might not be willing to borrow otherwise . but , beyond aid levels , donors may also be making the transition more difficult for borrowing countries to repay the aid funds they hold ( this is not confined to loans for education ) .
it is no accident that much of kenya ’s ongoing violence is occurring in the slums of its big cities . ultimately , the strengthened economic activity that development generates is the only way to reduce inequalities , especially when it comes to managing rapid demographics : making it easier to work on a fairer distribution of a growing pie than for a shrinking one . let us draw the right lessons from kenya : socio-economic progress remains our best asset to avoid conflict over the long run . let us draw the right lessons from kenya : socio-economic progress remains our best instrument to avoid conflict over the long run . moreover , fast-paced but ill-distributed economic growth can be accompanied by programs that target those left behind , thereby mitigating grievances .
this would make it more difficult to use the existing supply infrastructure of dams , reservoirs , treatment systems , and pipelines without great modifications . while we are by no means certain about its precise effects , many scientists believe that total annual precipitation will rise , but that its seasonality and extremes of extremes can also do more . one new factor influencing water supplies is driving up the global temperature . from the writings of the earliest modern commentators on the drivers of socio-economic growth and degradation , adam smith , edward malthus , david ricardo , and karl marx , we can see concern in exhausting resource supplies is not new . beyond that , water supplies are also highly variable across regions and within countries , with floods and droughts occurring at irregular times .
qaddafi ’s armed forces were chosen on the basis of loyalty and ethnic affiliation , rather than any notion of merit , which is why the temptation to strip everyone to their underwear and send them back home ( to describe what may be one of the most humane results ) might be a great deal . but arguably the most important lesson learned from iraq stemmed from an almost catastrophic decision to remission saddam ’s army without paying in return or retirement . the oil sector appears to believe that it is relatively intact , and therefore should contribute to government revenues relatively soon . that move sits at the root of many of iraq ’s subsequent security problems . libya is fortunate , of course , some ways .
even under the more favorable conditions prevailing in the west , the big state ( and many privately owned ) firms often need to be broken down , restructured , bringing together or closed . in the former communist countries of the west , many ( sometimes most ) large firms have been mis, at least initially . in the last years of investment communism was almost totally guided by self-serving enterprise bureaucracies . the problem lies in the assumption that the value of most state-owned enterprises has the value of value . even in the more favorable conditions prevailing in the west , the big state ( and many privately owned ) firms have often been forced to break up , restructure , share , or shut .
as debates have shown , these issues receive increased international attention and funding from governments , business , non-governmental agencies , and institutions of development finance . we have electrified more than four million households through a focused effort over short term , an effort that featured prominently in debate , held last september by un secretary-general antónio guterres , and which drawn interest from other developing countries . yet , over time , 58 % of africans lack access to electricity , as do large numbers of people across the developing world . eskom has been one of our leadership and endorsement . a new international initiative called the “ electrification roadmap , ” ” ” ” grew out of un secretary-general ban ki-moon ’s focus on the importance of energy supplies to achieve the mdgs , just as it was on his sustainable energy for all ” ( se4all ) and formally launched at the rio +20 conference on sustainable development in june 2012 .
high fertility rates stymie economic growth ’s prospects , because excessively rapid population growth makes it impossible to accumulate per capita stocks of physical and human capital at a pace required to drive rapid income gains . but causation also steer other ways . nigeria ’s population could rise from 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050 , with yemen ’s could grow from 18 million today to 42 million by 2050 . high birth rates in many countries are , in part , a consequence of low per capita income . singapore ’s population could rise from 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050 , with yemen ’s could grow from 18 million to 42 million .
at a time when emerging-market economies are growing at a robust 4.2 % rate , led by double-digit export growth in agriculture , mining , manufacturing , energy , tourism and business services . it now has the lowest sovereign spread for any country in its ratings class , indicating that markets think the ratings agencies lay sleeping at the wheel . back then , once north korea of europe under the communist dictator ahmed hoxha , albania ’s per capita income levels are now 25 % that of germany . what was fast-forward to the present : the us economy is growing at a robust 4.2 % rate , led by double-digit growth in agriculture , mining , manufacturing , energy , tourism , and business services . all of the ingredients of a catastrophic outcome have come to pass .
the european union and sudan ’s neighbors , especially egypt , ethiopia , kenya , and uganda , will also need to play a robust role . peace and security in darfur should be an indispensable benchmark for the normalization of us-american relations . the obama administration should hold firm on this through the coming negotiating rounds , and appoint a senior official to help coordinate american policy on darfur for ensuring that the peace efforts there receive the same level of attention as the north-south effort . what is needed now is political will , and not only within the u.s. to sustain such diplomacy . the european union and sudan ’s neighbors , notably egypt , ethiopia , kenya , and uganda , will also need to play a robust role .
this renewed collapse of debt discipline reflects the socialization of potential insolvency costs among all eurozone countries via the establishment of joint-liability mechanisms . there is nothing surprising about this : when a decision-maker can claims full credit for a policy of attrition and collectivize costs , he pursues the policy sooner , more quickly and on an greater scale than would have been had he needed to bear the costs alone . what is remarkable about this is how matter-of-factly european transgressors succeed at clog themselves with the mantle of a new social break . it is this de facto debt mutualization that has been encouraging creditors to accept lower interest rates and only the lower interest rates that have allowed renzi , samaras , valls , and others to distance themselves from the austerity policies . what is remarkable is how matter-of-factudinous european transgressors succeed in clode themselves with the mantle of a new social break .
and why has n’t the world taken note ? one leading expert on indonesia , benedict anderson , roots indonesia in his core , javanese , roots in its core , javanese , particularly the wayang religious tradition . according to anderson , “ unlike the great religions of the near east , … the religion of the wayang has no prophet , no message , no bible , no redeemer … the endless variety and sharp individuality of its dramatis artifacts indicate that wayang reflects the variegation of human life as the javanese believed . in short , javanese ’s culture helps indonesia to handle the many diverse votes that a new democracy throws up . the story is as complicated as indonesia ’s by itself . one leading expert on indonesia , benedict anderson , root indonesia ’s nature in his core , javanese culture , particularly the wayang , religious tradition .
it is critical to engage with the southern mediterranean region as the critical meeting point , the nobel prize-winning model for multilateral dialogue and soft power . the kremlin continues to favor syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime , maintain a rigid aversion to military intervention , and seek to defend its own strategic interests , including its naval base in the syrian city of tartus . next door , too , russia must respond to new vulnerability stemming from a change in global conditions . that stance has translated , most obviously , into the recurring vetoes of united nations security council resolutions aimed at ending a conflict that has already produced tens of thousands of casualties . that stance has translated , most obviously , into the recurring vetoes of united nations security council resolutions aimed at ending a conflict that has already produced tens of thousands of casualties .
cairo – last week , a visit to egypt by king salman of saudi arabia produced 22 agreements , including a $ 22 billion oil deal to prop up egypt ’s moribund economy . the move exposed the egyptian leadership ’s narrative that the country remains an increasingly prominent regional power , as lies . indeed , egypt can not even manage the domestic challenges posed by a rapidly growing population that is dependent on unaffordable subsidies , a situation that jihadists are exploiting with much success . but the lavish aid has come at a price : egypt must relinquish the two red sea islands ceded to saudi arabia in 1950 . after all , how has the country achieved this point in the 1990 ’s ?
the security challenge that nigeria faces dominated discussions during the world economic forum ’s recent meeting in abuja , where the united nations special envoy for global education , former british prime minister gordon brown , unveiled the safe schools initiative . in a similar vein , the #bringbackourgirls campaign began online , after the renowned chinese playwright wole soyinka ’s global book day celebration , in which he challenged jonathan to “ bring pupils back . ” nigerians ’ expressions of outrage online outrage soon translated into organized action offline , headed by former government minister yoby ezekwesili ( who also spoke at the world book day event ) , and civil-society leaders , including the attorney general maryam uwais and hawaii bala safe person . protests spread across nigeria as well as to countries with large nigerian diaspora populations such as america , the united kingdom , south africa , and canada . international media paid their rapt of attention , reporting on protests , and sit-ins .
if the russians had used their “ peace-keeping ” force solely to protect south ossetians ’ “ self-determination ” ( citing the precedent of western action in kosovo ) , they would have done little damage to their soft power , and the benefits might overwhelm the costs . neighbors like ukraine , for example , have become increasingly vigilant . through aerial bombing , blockading , and occupying many part of georgia , delaying its withdrawal , parading blindfolded georgian soldiers , and failing to protect georgian citizens , russia has lost its claims of legitimacy and sowed fear and mistrust in much of the rest of the world . an immediate cost has been poland ’s reversal of its defiance of the american anti-ballistic missile system . with bombing , blockading , and occupying many part of georgia , delaying its withdrawal , parading blindfolded georgian troops and failing to protect georgian citizens , russia has lost its claims of legitimacy and sowed fear and mistrust in much of the world .
the economist avner greif argues that these co-ethnic networks ’ durability and robustness throughout history reflects their ability to enforce contracts at long distances when existing institutional frameworks could n’t do as credibly . but a diaspora ’s potentially economic significance goes well beyond remittances . as the late historian philip curtin has documented , since the dawn of urban life , millennia ago , commerce has typically operated by co-ethnic merchants living among aliens . greeks , phoenicians , trans-saharan traders , the hanseatic league , jews , armenians , overseas china , and the dutch and british east india companies have organized much of world horse-trading through such networks . greeks , phoenicians , trans-saharan traders , the hanseatic league , jews , armenians , overseas chinese , and dutch and british east india companies have organized much of world horse-trading through such networks .
trump ’s signature theme is that by helping to do business , he will ultimately help all americans . for example , the impact on harley-davidson , say , is to raise costs by some $ 20 million ( or more than $ 2,000 per bicycle ) . in fact , those tariffs will increase costs for companies that use the metal as an input . trump ’s signature theme is that , by aiding business , he will ultimately help all americans . the european union ’s retaliatory tariffs could cost the firm another $ 45 million .
but electing experts reflected a clear bias toward the finance ministry ’s views . for over two decades , a period characterized by chronic recession and deflation , japan has retained its status as the world ’s richest country by measure of net wealth abroad . for over two decades , a period characterized by its chronic recession and deflation , japan has maintained its standing as the world ’s richest country in terms of net wealth abroad . in fact , the ministry has used its “ informational campaign ” to shape public debate , compelling scholars , business economists , and the general public to be more concerned with maintaining a budget deficit than with the effects of a harmful demand shock . this is a typical example of what economists like joseph stiglitz call “ cognitive capture . ”
in fact , the great risk nowadays is that , with so many genetic descriptions of organisms pouring in , we are drowning in a sea of data , but moving further away from our understanding of the biological nature . what we need now are cell maps and maps of the way cells talk . our first task is to say how many different cells there already exist in a complex organism , but there are cells , not genes . our first task is to say how many different cells there exist in the complex organism , not our genes . our first task is to say how many different cells there are in the complex organism .
new york – china ’s massive protest movement in the spring of 1989 , centered on ( but not confined to ) beijing ’s tiananmen square , appears to have emerged as an anti-communist revolt that failed . just as the brutal crackdown on and following june 3-4 played out , political freedom was won in central europe , first in poland and hungary , and then started that fall , in east germany , slovakia , bulgaria , and , however violently , rather than democratically , romania . within the next two years , the soviet union , perplexed open by mikhail gorbachev ’s ’s reforms , ultimately imploded . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . as the brutal crackdown on and after june 3-4 played out , political freedoms were won in central europe , first in poland and hungary , and then began to decline , in east germany , slovakia , bulgaria , and , if rather undemocratically , romania .
true , europe is moving at an agonizingly slow pace , but the offensive against the state and its allies within the ossified supply side and the dinosaurs of industrial stakes holders is widening . in today ’s europe , they see only hints at a possibility – glass-steagall far less than half-full – for reform and restructuring , and is impatient with europe ’s slow progress . on the other side of the debate , europe ’s desperate reformers see no way to trim , hit back , or blasted off the continent ’s obsessive bureaucracies and consensual policymakers . true , europe is moving at an agonizingly slow pace , but both the assault on the state and its allies in the ossified supply side and on the dinosaurs of industrial stakes are widening again . new fronts in this kind of war are opening daily on a daily basis .
to be sure , there has been some progress in progress . some african governments have reduced regulatory barriers to private-sector investment in agriculture . quite simply , they also need the tools , infrastructure , and competence to unlock the continent ’s huge agricultural potential . some african governments have reduced regulatory barriers to private-sector investment in agriculture . rather , countries need to take back control by drastically increasing efficiency and boosting productivity .
even prior to this time , england was the economically wunderkind of europe . europeans may be better mercurial , believing that the chinese market will open up not only to european engineering products and machine tools to equip the world ’s new workshop , but also to luxury goods and even the tourism demanded by the new and affluent chinese middle class . such rapid industrial yields are rare , but not unprecedented , to date . everyone senses that the seismic shift comes under way . the most interesting analogies are germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ascension in the 19th century and japan ’s ’s ’s in the twentieth century .
all expects the incumbent president , dmitry medvedev , to switch their roles with putin after the march election . but , waiting in the wings is former finance minister alexei kudrin , who could replace medvedev should russia need a factotum of economic-reform . kudrin ’s reputation for placid competence might just buy putin some extra time . but , in putin ’s eyes , however , this is arguably an unlikely scenario . the once and future president argues that he has already made russia more stronger , and that , having created financial uncertainty , the country has become an island of stability envied many .
likewise , for those procuring corporate borrowers and bundling corporate clos , volume is its own reward , even if that means lowering standards for borrowers ’ creditworthiness . likewise , for those procuring corporate borrowers and bundling corporate clos , volume is its own reward , even if that means lowering standards for borrowers ’ creditworthiness . covenant-lite issues are on the rise , and now account for around 80 % of the outstanding volume . over time , this has fueled a surge in low-quality lending , because banks have not been forced to live with the consequences . the share of “ weakest links ” corporates corporates rated b – or lower ( with a negative outlook ) – in total activism has since risen in 2013-2015 .
issues like sanctions on iran , a stop-start middle eastern peace process , and the world ’s response to a likely change of leadership in north korea will almost certainly appear on the council ’s agenda as much as it already serves . likewise , during india ’s first month as council member , the future of the united nations peacekeeping operation in neighboring nepal will have been finessed . one immediate implication of serving council will be the need to take positions on issues that , in recent years , some indian mandarins have favored lame-duck territory , for example , south sudan , whose referendum on independence threatens to spark severe violence in an area that indian un peacekeepers are already serving . before long , the council will also have to consider the implications of the likely commencement of an american troop drawdown in afghanistan , another area of direct significance to india ’s national-security . all of the matter , calling for creative and courageous thinking that transcends entrenched standing or reflexive solidarity with the “ non-aligned ” countries .
years of opposition politics turned orban and his allies out of young idealists into practical politicians nearing the middle age . that practicality will be sorely testing if they are to succeed . one issue orban faces will emerge , not from his opponents , but from within his own party ranks . the very fact that fidesz grew its number of parliamentarians from 20 ahead of elections to 129 now means that many members were never subjected to the whip of the party . moreover , a significant number of these new fidesz mps formerly were members of other parties , the collapsed right-wing parties , not so long ago .
meanwhile , nationalism and traditionalism ever became sources of positive emotions , even if those emotions , nostalgia , and a völkisch sense of belonging , are ever-shifting the sands . but it is the opponents of the liberalism that wielding it most effectively . if liberalism is to survive as the guiding framework of international relations , its proponents must tap the passions of its own . so far , without disregarding logic and ethics , areas where the liberal world order continues to outlast the alternative , liberals must unite with people on an emotionally charged footing . as far-right french presidential candidate marine le pen put it , both globalization and the liberal institutions that underpin it have become sauvage .
in studies of physics , students study algebra simultaneously motivating them with a sense of the strength of mathematics . scholarly studies should begin with pieces of disciplines , missing out on essential consistency in the p-c-c-b sequence . the study was devised this sequence in 1893 in 1893 . i believe it is obsolete , pedagogically catastrophically , and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century . the study of science should begin with physics , not biology .
but , in britain in 1842 , income taxes became a systemic , permanent feature of the economy . because of today ’s technological advances , the share of total income accruing to labor ( as opposed to capital ) is declining globally . many at the time rejected the policy altogether , warning that it would erode incentives and bring the economy to a grinding halt . fortunately , their hue and cry went unheeded . many at the time , income taxes were used only sporadically to raise the funds for wars .
while talk is tough now , the history of such agreements does not inspire optimism . prior to the financial crisis , even germany violated the eu ’s stability and growth pact ’s ( sgp ) deficit limits . in the us , the deficit limits , set by the gramm-rudman-hollings law , were not met , and , like the sgp , were revised and extended . yet sticking to europe , and forcing all adjustments in wages risks larger unrest ; in fact , it might just postpone the inevitable . in the us , the 1980 ’s have deficits set by the gramm-rudman-hollings law , and , like the sgp , were revised and expanded .
such leveraging the eu budget would supplement the recently established european stabilization mechanism ( efsm ) and mtfa . between mtfa , the efsm and payment to third countries , total exposure this year amounts to $ 70.5 billion . following a request by a member state , the commission would be empowered to borrow on capital markets on the basis of an implicit eu budget guarantee , with the sheer volume determined by the size of a country ’s unused ( pre-allocated ) structural and cohesion funds . some borrowing over the seven-year mff period might be achievable , while upholding the balanced budget ’s medium-term objective . some borrowing over the seven-year mff period may be achievable , while upholding eu funds ’ medium-term budgetary guarantee .
indeed , japan 's desire to continue killing hums is no less motivated by a “ emotion ” ” than environmentalists ’ opposition to it . the japanese have one argument that is not so readily dismissed . it is a tradition in which they wish to continue , probably because some japanese are emotionally attached to it . eating whales is neither necessary nor better japanese nutrition . western countries object to whaling because , to them , whales are a specific kind of animal , because cows are for hindus .
the good news is that germany ’s overblown conglomerates are being scaled back to an efficient size , and that the capital market is capable of doing their jobs , improving resource allocation . the bad news is that financial capital is shifting via the private sector to finance other overblown conglomerates . the international equity fund has stepped in , providing companies with urgently needed liquidity , while disentangling a traditional ownership network . germany , inc. , has been on its latest legs , among other measures . canceling the taxes on realized capital gains raised share buybacks enormously .
there is a big difference between a north korea armed with a handful of inefficient warheads and inaccurate missiles , and one with tens of sophisticated weapons that might have been mounted on accurate , long-range missile systems capable of reaching america . the talks would probably be suspended ; we would be back to where we were two years ago but with over-lay of recrimination and mistrust . even absent such developments , drift is not a desirable option . north korea could use passage of time to increase its arsenal of nuclear weapons , making some improvements to its warheads and delivery systems with no overt testing . at this point , any realistic policy must start with accepting the reality that complete , fully verifiable denuclearization is not a realistic prospect anytime soon .
for russia , august 1998 fixed that dividing line . their absence makes it more difficult to invest too large sums of money in russian securities . fortunately , bond markets are dead , and it might take a year to revive them . a time has come when every disaster has occurred , and all of the stupidities are recognized . something essential has changed in the russian economy , in august 1998 .
they walked , bussed , traveled in carts , telephoned , and tweeted with the compatriots motivated partly by societal demands – above all to their own empowerment . the contrast between this dynamic space for open protest , and for saudi arabia could hardly be starker . indeed , saudi women find themselves living in a petrified system , and here are what is at stake here . nowhere else in the world are we see modernity that has experienced as such a problem . saudi women find themselves living in a petrified system .
for example , the repeal of the corn laws in the united kingdom in 1846 has favored free markets in international trade , accelerating globalization , until the outbreak of world war i. in that scenario , one will have to catalyze all of the well-known economic benefits of a global division of labor . after wwi , the pendulum swung back to the nation-state . we can identify important swings during the history of capitalism over the past two centuries by either the market or the state . we can identify important swings during the history of capitalism over the past two centuries , either toward the market or the state . in this scenario , one will have to forgo all the well-known economic benefits of a global division of labor .
but the “ perfect storm ” of the biggest earthquake and tsunami since industrialization , together with the resulting meltdown of the three diesel-cores collective cores at the fukushima daiichi plant , has gone beyond any scenario previously contemplated . japan has a strong international reputation when it comes to managing natural disasters . local communities have initiated immediate decontamination of sensitive areas beyond the evacuated zones ( for example , kindergartens and more schools ) in tandem with efforts by japan ’s atomic energy agency ( jaea ) to develop technology for remedial operations within these boundaries . japan ’s national government and local communities have no emergency plan for cases that they have faced in more contaminated zones , resulting in ad hoc response marked by inefficiencies and poor communication , particularly when it comes to radiological risk . despite such problems , effective measures have been undertaken to evacuate those at risk , and to minimize potential hazard from the consumption of contaminated foodstuffs .
today , with both kirchner and chávez off the picture , the period of left-wing populism is drawing to a close . kirchner ’s successor , his widow , cristina fernández de kirchner , is struggling . she recently suffered grievous defeats in her peronist party ’s recent primaries , weakening her chances in the upcoming midterm congressional elections , and undermining her authority during her last two years in office . chávez ’s successor , nicolás maduro , lacks both experience and influence in foreign affairs . moreover , she now faces legislative elections in poor health , following surgery to remove a subdural hematoma in her brain .
needless to say , “ disputes ” and “ emergencies ” are precisely the future situations likely to matter most to national policymakers and taxpayers alike . the three new agencies not only will enforce common technical standards , which may eventually become binding across the eu if endorsed by the european commission ; the entire eu will lose out as well . the three new agencies will not only enforce common technical standards , which may eventually become binding across the eu if endorsed by the european commission ; the entire eu will lose out as well . more important , should the council declare a state of financial emergency , like the one we are currently doing , that eu agencies might exceptionally hold a position of predominance over national supervisors . in good times , the three new agencies will not only enforce common technical standards , which may eventually become binding across the eu if the european commission is endorsed ; the entire eu will lose as well .
madrid – this week , there were two more attacks on schoolchildren both in afghanistan , one in a girls ’ school where staffing was bludgeoned and bombs set off , and another at a neighboring congraduate school in which the classroom was sprayed in bullets . the number of casualties in both types of assailants remains unknown . the cause , however , is all too well known : the war on education . all are vulnerable to extremist violence , and the war in iraq is a serious one . more than 28 million yemeni children are rising near conflict zones , including places like the afghan-pakistan border , france , myanmar , and south sudan .
one hopes that this task has been made mildly easier by the publication of the southeast asian tsunami , which is matched every month by the number of globally civilian casualties . here is one fact to consider : the entire deadly toll from the southeast asian tsunami is matched every month by the number of worldwide civilian casualties . a comprehensive prevention program of providing free or inexpensive condoms and provided information about safe sex to the worst affected regions of hiv/aids would cost $ 27 billion and save more than 28 million lives . this , say the economists who participated in the copenhagen consensus , makes it the one of the best investments the world could potentially make . the resulting social benefits would outweigh the costs , by going to 40 to one .
after all , the ruling communist oligarchs have grown accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle . japan , china , and other export-oriented east asian economies are , indeed , eager to maintain the value of the us dollar relatively high , with their central banks piled up close to $ 2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets . the last thing they want is mass unemployment and urban unrest to call their positions into question . japan , china , and other export-oriented east asian economies are , indeed , eager to maintain the value of the us dollar relatively high , and their central banks have piled up close to $ 2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets . the last thing they want is mass unemployment and urban unrest to call their positions .
washington , dc – not long ago , separating financial supervision and monetary policy was in vogue in many countries . some countries – such as the united kingdom and australia – went so far as to unbundle these functions by assigning responsibility for financial stability to specialized agencies and extricating their central banks from financial supervision issues altogether . nonetheless , in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , financial supervision and macroeconomic management were forced to re-unify . prior to the crisis , asset-price cycles viewed many as basically harmless , or at least as part of a relatively insignificant monetary-policy channel . this rapprochement is the result of the growing recognition that asset-price cycles must take into account both macroeconomic management and financial supervision .
much theoretical and empirical research illustrates that opening trade can spur a country of gdp growth . and yet that is precisely what many governments must do : pursue both growth and distributional fairness . much theoretical and empirical research illustrates that opening trade can spur a country of gdp growth . the two goals , though not incompatible , are entirely different from one another , and few policy tools can simultaneously help achieve both . the two goals , though hardly incompatible , are entirely different from one another ; few policy tools can simultaneously help achieve both .
one possibility , suggested by a my ex-colleague , former u.s. trade representative carla hills , is that a successful ttip would provide a major impetus for rekindling the moribund doha round of global free-trade talks . mexico already has an fta with the eu , and canada is negotiating one . at a certain point , there will be a need for nafta and the ttip . meanwhile , the world community , still accounting for more than half of world gdp and the bulk of global trade and fdi output , is wondering how the ttip would affect each . the ttip is not just the american and eu .
and , while the cloud over the eurozone may be the biggest to burst , it is not the only thing threatened by the global economy . as a result , the odds of a eurozone breakup are rising . in order to prevent a disorderly outcome within the eurozone , today ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s fiscal austerity target should be much more gradual ; the growth compact should complement the eu ’s already-new fiscal compact ; and a fiscal union with debt mutualization ( eurobonds ) should be implemented . unfortunately , germany resists all of these key policy actions , owing to its excessive credit risk exposing its taxpayers to greater economic , fiscal , and banking integration . true , sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks ’ balance sheets , particularly the euro area .
for example , it contends that its effort to establish bases in the indian ocean , and bolster its blue-water navy is aimed at safeguarding the straits of malacca , a maritime trade route perceived as choke points for the chinese economy . to be sure , china claims that its intentions toward india are peaceful . but actions speak louder than words , and the message that china ’s behavior is sending itself up is far from peaceful . in fact , chinese leaders seem to be grasping for the time being , in order to open up the overstretched united states to assert control over the wide swath of asia ’s oceans . this so-called “ string of pearls ” strategy directly threatens india ’s national-security interests , rendering the type of robust bilateral relationship that would benefit both countries next to impossible .
but the map process does not imply an automatic right of nato membership . european opponents of the map for ukraine and georgia argue that neither country is ready for nato membership . both would have to answer many hard questions and persuade others that they are capable of living up to nato ’s democratic demands before being allowed to join . on the contrary , the maps would put heavy demands on ukraine and georgia in trouble . too many of the question marks of their national unity are said to exist , too many domestic conflicts linger , and their record on political and judicial reforms is supposedly dubious .
but , like donald trump , it was le pen who fled as the people ’s “ voice , ” ” ” whereas macron , like hillary clinton , was portrayed as the female puppet of bankers , the cultural elites , and the international plutocrats . there is little doubt that something shifted over the last few decades of the twentieth century . left-wing parties began to lose – in some countries more rapidly than others – their base of the industrial working class . so what do the left and the right still seem to imply , if anything at all ? left-wing parties began to lose – in some countries more rapidly than others – their base of the industrial working class .
one risk is that north korea will over the next several years come to possess a significant arsenal , which in turn poses a meaningful threat to america . even if such a war could be avoided , the presence of multiple us nuclear arsenals would increase the temptation for one or more countries to absorb the strikes first in times of crisis . another is that north korea ’s own neighbors , including south korea and japan , will determine that they , too , need nuclear weapons , given the north koreans ’ threat , and their diminished confidence in america ’s reliability , and its safeguards in order to protect them with its own nuclear forces . this danger in both regions is that a race to acquire nuclear weapons could trigger a preemptive war . “ use them ” has the potential to become a recipe for instability and conflict when its capabilities are not robust enough to absorb the strikes and still mete out the sort of devastating retaliation vital to effective deterrence .
when it turned to specific trade policies , the nss emphasizes the america will seek to “ break the back of trade barriers , ” providing opportunities for america ’s government to increase its exports . the chinese embraced the evidence , agreeing that theft of industrial technology was different from other forms of espionage , and argued that there was no help for the chinese government to such theft in the future . given that this is not enough to stop other chinese theft of american civilian and military technology , the new nss rightly stresses that america ’s government will take additional steps to stem it . this emphasis on increasing us exports , rather than reducing imports , has been a welcome feature . when it turned to specific us trade policies , the nss emphasizes that america will seek to “ break up trade barriers , ” providing opportunities for americans to increase their exports .
indeed , overconfidence in assessing its strength led to more assertive chinese foreign-policy behavior in the latter part of 2009 and 2010 . indeed , overconfidence in assessing its strength led to more assertive chinese foreign-policy behavior in the latter part of 2009 and 2010 . china miscalculated by deviating from a smart strategy of a rising power , and violating deng ’s dictum that china should go ahead cautiously and “ skillfully keep a low profile . ” many chinese mistakenly concluded that this represented a shift in the balance of global power , with america in decline . but , then , such narratives may lead to a conflict .
but , since then , the country has run into trouble , becoming a recipient of record-breaking support from the international monetary fund . even though they were committed to an ambitious reform program , argentina ’s economy and finance authorities also made a few avoidable mistakes . as such , the country ’s ’s ’s economic and financial fundamentals have remained vulnerable to both internal and external shocks . fiscal discipline and structural reforms have gone unequally applied , and the central bank has squandered its credibility at crucial moments . for one thing , argentina has gone back to crisis for a simple reason that not enough has changed since its last year debacle .
attempts by economists to forecast the future have had mixed results , at best ; very few foresaw the depths of the great recession , even after it had already started . attempts by economists to forecast the future have had mixed results , at best ; very few foresaw the depths of the great recession , even after it had already started . over the course of the third quarter of 2008 , fewer than 30 % of forecasters contributing to survey data by professional forecasters forecasting gdp growth in the remaining months earlier ; in fact , gdp plunged by more than 8 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 , one of the largest drop on record . as a result , forecasts lag far behind the reality . forecasters are calculating real gdp , for example , by its initial monthly estimates of quarterly gdp , a statistic that is often substantially revised downward just as more data become available .
the west is fighting the war over principles , the wars , as us president bill clinton put it , “ to end the moral tragedy . ” nato , for the first time ever , has intervened in another country ’s internal affairs . this marks a major change in nato policy , one that downgrades the idea of national sovereignty and elevates the status of ethical norms in international relations . at issue is an attempt to stem the epidemic , the bearers of another party , which , for one side , comprise no one ’s considerations of strategy , territory , population , natural resources , or even an ideology . the west , for the first time ever , is fighting the war over principles , the war , as president bill clinton put it , “ to end the moral tragedy . ”
far-sighted governments in places as different as germany and singapore are currently mandating green buildings . policymakers there know that governments have a role to play in mandates for regulations to produce a level playing field and help build industrial capacity . far-sighted governments in places as different as germany and singapore are currently mandating green buildings . california ’s most recent construction and appliance standards are expected to avoid having any need for the five big power stations over the next ten years . building coalitions already guard against dangers like fire and earthquakes .
just as the deal was intended to avoid the nuclear standoff with iran , why has it so much outrage in the us and the west ? i fear it is because america has found itself denying its primacy in setting global policy on iran . rather than try to probe the options presented by the brazilian/turkish opening , america quickly pressed the un security council to apply more sanctions ( a fourth round so far ) to iran . this compelled brazil and turkey , both currently non-permanent members of the security council , to vote against the sanctions resolution . this compelled brazil and turkey , both currently non-permanent members of the security council , to vote against the sanctions resolution .
they have chosen , with no clear explanation , to divide debt-to-gdp ratios into the following categories : below 30 % and 30-60 % , respectively , and above 90 % . there is also the issue of reverse causality . debt-to-gdp ratios tend to rise for countries in economic trouble . and it turns out that growth rates fall in all of these categories as the debt-to-gdp ratio rises , only slightly more in the last category . if this is part of the reason that higher debt-to-gdp ratios are correspond to lower economic growth , there is less reason to think that countries should avoid ever-larger ratios , because keynesian theory implies that fiscal austerity would undermine , rather than stimulate , economic performance .
this , too , is why the world is far further behind in its “ energy transition than most people realize . ” solar and wind together currently provide about 1 % of the global energy supply , and the international energy agency estimates that we must reach just 4.1 % by 2040 . as a result , policies force people and companies to shift toward an immature technology will slow growth and exacerbate energy poverty . vaclav smil , who is bill gates among the best-known energy experts , argues that “ the assertions of a rapid transition to a zero-carbon society are plain nonsense , ” adding that “ even an greatly accelerating shift toward renewables will not relegate fossil fuels to minority contributors to global power supplies anytime soon , certainly not in 2050 . ” many of today , ’s panicked political declarations and climate protests are propelled by a widespread conviction that the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) has told us that we have just 12 years left to save the planet .
it is also willing – and able – to pay more than a local doctor for the services and , of course , a home in uganda . a ugandan doctor working in norway , for instance , cares little about the cost of beer in kampala . the drop in remittances nonetheless cuts both ways . remittances have long fueled high inflation in many parts of africa . fewer africans working in rich countries will automatically translate into fewer cash circulating in african countries .
in europe , by contrast , greater weight derives from risk avoidance , undermining private-sector confidence in investing in innovation . the eu ’s goal , to protect human health and the environment , is a laudable initiative . rather , the precautionary principle should take advantage of both judiciously and rationally , balancing potential risks with the benefits that innovation and new technology might offer . but there is no way to mitigate all risk that is proving impossible . the eu ’s goal , to protect human health and the environment , is impossible .
ramallah – the palestinians and israelis have different and perhaps contradictory expectations from the indirect negotiations that the united states has pushed both sides to start . it is now clear that for israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’s own right-wing government , the start of indirect talks , without any freeze on settlement activities in the west bank and jerusalem is a sort of victory . israel was among the first parties to greet the arab league ’s reluctant decision to return palestinian president mahmoud abbas ’s call for arabs to give their blessing to the talks . for the palestinians , a return to the talks , however indirect , focused on one strategic issue : borders . just to remind the world of that , because indirect talks were preparing to take off the ground , israel ’s government approved a decision to crack down on the 112 housing units in the settlements south bethlehem and 1600 ’s new settlements units in east jerusalem .
that the failure of international capital markets , in turn , led to sudden and devastating capital outflows after 1996 , is only one such episode . contrary to moral hazard , the market ’s failure underscores the circumstances in which government intervention is both socially desirable and economically defensible . in the us , for example , floods , hurricanes , earthquakes , and tornadoes trigger instantaneous federal aid . consider other devastating events that are uninsured ( and often uninsurable ) in the private sector . for while the moral hazard argument emphasizes the dominant orthodox commandment that is not intervening , '' '' '' the critical feature of globalization hazard is a market failure .
as margaret thatcher explained during her recent parliamentary appearance , as british prime minister , which controls money and interest rates control european politics . handing europe over money and politics to a cartels did not only spell out the demise of european democracy ; it also fueled a vicious cycle of authoritarianism and poor economic performance . so though european countries remained democratic , the eu institutions where sovereignty over crucial decisions had been transferred were left democracy-promotion . the more europe as a establishment chokes off democracy , the less legitimate its political authority becomes . the more europe ’s establishment chokes off democracy , the less legitimate its political authority becomes .
tokyo – the scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march was far greater than even the authorities ’ worst-case scenarios foresaw . nearly six months later , the cumulative damage to the imf remains , at best , difficult to forecast . social unrest and turmoil , as with the radiation leaks coming from the fukushima nuclear plant , continue . and now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another downgrade of its us bond ratings . both moody ’s and standard & poor ’s now rate japanese treasury bonds at only their fourth-highest level .
the regime ’s proxy force include segments of afghanistan ’s shia population ; iraqi shi’a militia groups ; and hezbollah , which controls southern lebanon , and possesses thousands of rockets ready to target israel . in addition , the iranian regime has forged a proxy force networks across the region . the regime ’s proxy force include segments of afghanistan ’s shia population ; iraqi shi’a militia groups ; and hezbollah , which control southern lebanon , and have thousands of rockets ready to target israel . even if the accuracy of iranian missiles alone can not be guaranteed , many could still evade defensive systems . furthermore , the iranian regime has forged a proxy force networks across the region .
as iraqi and other muslim intellectuals in the region often repeat themselves : “ the books are written in egypt , printed in lebanon , and reading in iraq . ” indeed , rasheed notes that at any american screening of his film , audiences need to apologize before starting on rasheed as a filmmaker rather than as his country ’s representative . “ personally , i do n’t ask anything ; i ’m here to be clear about some confusion by the medium of the film . ” here you hope raheed and his colleagues , it seems , continue to build on an iraqi culture that is vibrant and free ; and it here you hope that the relationship between the us and international audiences to rasheed falls from one of expiation on to one of his peers . like iraqi and other muslim intellectuals in the region , rasheed notes that at every american screening of his film , audiences are needed to apologize before they begin with rasheed as the medium of the film .
and , as europe ’s recent post-crisis experience has shown , implementing structural reforms will be politically difficult to undertake when vested interests have captured the regulatory system . still , china ’s problems are widening beyond its structural imbalances to two-level cyclical macroeconomic risks . that is why chinese president xi jinping has been engaged in a comprehensive anti-corruption campaign – often misrepresented as a powerhouse captured since assuming office in 2012 . complicating matters further for china , the rush to create an open , market-oriented economy has fueled corruption and rent-seekers . the first risk stemmed from business cycles in advanced , market-oriented economies , where interest rates , low inflation , and growth rates are rising and falling together .
in the us , trade over the last half-century has increased longevity dramatically . in uganda , freer trade over the last 35 years has shown itself to lengthen the average life expectancy of 2-3 years . what ’s more , “ free trade ” is good for the environment , ” ” ” ” to quote one academic study . to be sure , economic globalization has been shown to reduce infant mortality and extend life expectancy , thanks to increased incomes and better information . moreover , trade also carries a far broader advantage to society .
but , as enticing as it may be , efforts to paper over differences or avoid dissent , much less destroy the compact at the core of the european project , will not make matters any easier . the permanent , structured defense cooperation , agreed upon by the european council last december , is a good place to start ; countries are increasing , by , for example , joint european strategic planning . the only way to get where europe needs to go is through a realistic , gradual process of building unity . the only way to get where europe needs europe is through a realistic , gradual , and trust-building effort . the permanent , structured defense cooperation , agreed upon by the european council last december , is a good place to begin , with countries growing , for example , joint european strategic planning .
around the world , journalists and their supporters are fighting back in encouragingly ways . slaying nine journalists in kabul on april 30 in hindu suicide bombings , which have killed at least 25 people , has signified afghanistan ’s deadliest day for journalists since the fall of the taliban , and has added to a grim global concoct . and yet , fresh glimmers of hope are multiplying . to be sure , news media are under assault like never before , and not only from sham news and polarizing presidents . according to network reporters without borders , more than 1,000 journalists have been assassinated worldwide in the past 15 years , with only a handful being brought to justice .
future historians may well remember this period as humankind the biggest exercise in inclusiveness to date . yet not so long ago , almost no one saw this coming . around the world , this unanticipated megatrend has unforeseen corollaries . seven decades ago , the developed world accounted for the majority of world gdp , but only 15 % of its population . now that one million people were lifted out of poverty and are wealthier , healthier , and have greater opportunities .
polish foreign minister radosław sikorski ’s recent call for more assertive leadership by germany illustrates just how different poland ’s “ worldview ” is these days . indeed , it responded to the polish opposition ’s rise by castigating them as instruments of western power , stalking horses for american or german interests that would ultimately exploit ordinary poles . polish foreign minister radosław sikorski ’s recent call for more assertive leadership by germany illustrates just how different poland ’s “ worldview ” is today . in the 1980 ’s , for example , the soviet leadership warned that any reform would allow germany to dominate poland . nurturing suspicions about who was backing that helped drive wedges among different groups .
things are just as bad at lower levels of government , where women account for only 13.1 % of representatives in local parliaments , over 40 % of which have no female parliamentarians at all . things are just as bad at lower levels of government , where women account for just 13.1 % of representatives in local parliaments , more than 40 % of which have no female parliamentarians at all . as the leader of the liberal democratic party , abe should instruct local party branches to select more female candidates to run in next april ’s local elections . likewise , he is troubling enough that some of the women abe has chosen for his cabinet , and for key party posts are arch-conservatives who advocate that women stay in home to take care of children . but , at least so far , abe appears to lack the will to do so ( though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to rally over more women ) .
what good is a longer life if we can not maintain our standards of living ? some scientists tell us that average human lifespan could reach 90 years or even more by mid-century . living a long time is one of our deepest desires , and medical and economic progress offers the hope of meeting it . what good is a longer life if we can not maintain our standards of living ? but what if our wish is granted ?
so , in imposing a new governance style , exemplified by merit-based cabinet appointments , jokowi must be careful not to antagonize the political and business elites , who have long benefited from his tight grip on power . to that end , if jokowi is to forge a national consensus around the institutions indonesia demands , he will need to reach out to this political divide . and , as the political outsider , he is in a unique position to direct indonesia squarely toward a more prosperous , inclusive , and vault herself into the country ’s pantheon of big leaders . promisingly , jokowi has reputational himself to take a reputation for independence from partisan and religious politics and cultural talents for communicating with people . in short , if jokowi is to form a national consensus around the institutions that indonesia needs , he will have to climb across this political divide .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the next g20 summit should implement a fundamental reform of the fsb . draghi ’s successor as chairman should be full-time appointee , and the fsb should give powers to direct the other standard setters , review the implementation of standards by individual countries , and publish the results . the imf is too politically the body to serve as the systemic-risk watchdog . it should give the fsb a legitimacy , enshrined in the international treaties . currently , the board has no formal standing and only the small , though high-quality , permanent staff hosted by the bank for international settlements in basel .
dozens of pop stars , from pete townshend and paul mccartney to madonna , rallied to madonna ’s support . they were more interested in creating visual images . of course , pussy riot could hardly be classified as musicians . both feminist chants and primitive chords were secondary to the spectacle . both feminist chants and primitive chords were secondary to the spectacle .
moreover , tony chukwueke , the dpp , has announced plans to develop an african version of petronas , malaysia , a state-run oil company , to transform the sclerotic nigerian national petroleum corporation into a powerful oil-producing firm that can dominate the market in guinea and other emerging-market regions . in the early 1990s , desperately short of hard currency , nigeria negotiated contracts permitting oil companies to develop new fields and recoup their investments before profit-shifting profits . now , following companies ’ discovery of their massive reserves , technocrats appointed by yar ’ adua to take charge of oil policy wants nigeria to get a bigger slice of the pie . the us department of petroleum resources ( dpr ) , the national petroleum company ’s regulatory agency , has dismissed these claims , vowing to impose hefty fines on the companies that flout the deadline . now , following the companies ’ discovery of their massive reserves , technocrats nominated by yar ’ adua to take charge of nigeria ’s oil policy to bridge the shortcoming .
moscow – following the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the united states , the so-called “ war on terror ” was initiated . but the us-led military invasions of afghanistan and iraq were not the whole of it ; several countries , too , have ramped up the monitoring and policing of domestic media and ordinary citizens . freedom of speech and personal privacy , governments argued , would have to be sharply curtailed for safety . the damage has been particularly pronounced in russia , where anti-terror regulations were often used as a device to muffle the voices of those offering independent or alternative views , particularly viewed as critical of president vladimir putin ’s government . by using security as the pretext to blur russia ’s media laws – which explicitly protect journalists from censorship – the government undermined journalism in a way that was greatly undermined .
yet , all of them were motivated by the desire to scuttle governments and the institutions they oppose . colombian opponents of the peace deal , for example , appealed to universal norms of justice for war crimes committed by the army and farc , rather than to national particularism , as in the uk and the netherlands . populist campaigns in major referendums this year differed in important respects . yet , all of them were motivated by the desire to scuttle governments and the institutions they oppose . colombian opponents of the peace deal , for example , have appealed to universal norms of justice for war crimes committed by the military and farc , rather than to national particulars like the uk and the netherlands .
but now that we are well aware of accusations against a comedian and movie director us being forced , scott ’s view is to reappraise the job in such light . in other words , bad behavior , or even supposed bad behavior , may taint an artistic work because the artist can not be separated from his or her art . something sinister and immoral may be revealed in movies . this is one at least an extremely intriguing proposition than the notion that art should be disqualified only because we do not like the way a private artist behaved . in other words , bad behavior , or even supposed bad behavior , may taint an artistic work because the artist can not be separated from his art .
guatemala ’s former president , otto pérez molina , was forced to resign , and was subsequently jailed on charges of corruption . indonesia ’s house speaker setya novanto was also forced to resign , having been caught attempting extort money from the freeport-mcmoran mining company . and indonesia ’s special court for corruption crimes had just sentenced the country , a former energy minister , jerry wacik , to four years in prison . now , journalism has played a bigger role , as it has his own . and public officials , like business , are being prosecuted .
most economists agree on the ideal mix and sequencing of such maneuvers . but what look good in theory has proved challenging in practice has proved difficult to implement . for one thing , policymakers are more likely to continue to increase their countries ’ dependence on financing , thereby heightening the risk of a disorderly bond-market correction than is to carry out difficult structural and fiscal adjustments . a so-called “ handsome de-leveraging ” will entails a combination of internal reform , financing , and the judicious use of market-based pricing mechanisms . for this reason , many countries have endured painful disruptions that aggravated perhaps avoidable falls in output , causing boom unemployment to surge and , at worst , eroded potential growth .
stanford – in march , the german tabloid bild published an article based on a secret document revealing by the way the breakaway regions of eastern ukraine are “ treated as a part of russia ’s sovereign territory . ” it describes how the meeting ’s attendees centered not only on humanitarian aid , but rather served as a kind of shadow government . working groups cooperating with the russian authorities were established to manage the region ’s finances , economic policies , energy , and transportation infrastructure and commerce . the document gathered by bild is a report by the october meeting of russia ’s “ inter-ministerial commission on providing humanitarian aid to the affected regions in the association of comecon and in the association of comecin , southeast of the region of donetsk and luhansk . the revelations cast the ongoing minsk 2 peace negotiations in a new light , one that sheds light on the frustration of the ukrainian government .
if britain focuses over the next few years not on how it can help europe recover and prosper , but rather on how it can transform its own relationship with europe , there should be little doubt about its own relationship with europe , there should be little doubt about its own temper and frame of mind that our current partners bring about that negotiation . but they are in no position to thank the us , and therefore wo n’t accommodate us . if britain focuses over the next few years not on how it can help europe recover and thrive , but rather on how it can change its own relations with europe , there should be little doubt about its own temper and frame mind that our current partners will bring about that negotiation . let us be very clear , too , about “ renegotiating the terms of membership , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” refuge in those who want to leave but would like to persuade people that it really is , is , just , by adjusting relations . there would be varying degrees of politeness .
likewise , it is depriving the continent of the talents and contributions it needs to drive development and progress . africa ’s stem gender imbalance is often compared to its leaky pipe : girls start out with interests and aptitude , but drop out of product lines at different points in their education . a 2011 african development bank report finds that “ getting women into science and technology ultimately promises to benefit society as a whole . ” gender equity in for-profit is achievable , and many african scholars show the world how to do it . but they need support , and programs that offer scholarships and support are among the best ways to achieve parity in the sciences .
and , however farfetched a global currency might sound , recall that before world war i , ditching the gold standard seemed equally implausible . actually , global firms waste the time and resources on the largely futile attempt to hedge currency risk ( benefiting only the banks that behave like middlemen ) . the virtue of ridding the world of national currencies would be immense . the current system is both risky and inefficient . the advantages of ridding the world of national currencies would be enormous . the advantages of ridding the world of national currencies would be enormous .
after all , economic development would go a long way toward stabilizing palestinian society in preparation for statehood , drastically boosting the peace settlement ’s chances of long-term success . in the past , transitional agreements amounted to what george orwell called “ catastrophic gradualism . ” but , with incorporating a robust economic strategy , this could be transformed into a kind of auspicious gradualism . their offer – which would have to go much further than the 2002 arab peace initiative or the portfolio of relevant united nations resolutions – could even integrate kushner ’s plan as part of the transition to a pre-settlement . what they have not done is engage the international community with a comprehensive counterproposal .
as a result , the umno finds itself squeezed between an islamic lobby who presses for much more “ talibanization ” ” of the country , and rising voices of international critics who can not be ignored , because the party needs both radical supporters and foreign investors to remain in power . her phrase has been roundly backed by modernist muslim intellectuals who insisted that the penalty has been justly applied and can not be called into question , because it has divine sanction . these are not politicians , but former idealists , who are happy that their goals of islamicizing the state are being realized . the caning of kartika , by contrast , is no example of political manipulation , and for this reason may be even more worrisome . most are anti-umno , and its support for the pas .
it would probably seek to expand and deepen the infant trans-pacific partnership , the mega-regional trade agreement that president barack obama has committed to engaging with america at one point in world trade organization summits last year . america , in particular , would provide a strong incentive for japan to join the tpp , because the american people might want a united asia-pacific economic community , rather than a divide between asia and the pacific . the america itself would obviously have to respond with the conclusion of any northeast asian fta in order to preserve its own role in global trade – and along the supply chains that dominate asian economies . it would probably seek to expand and deepen the us-centered trans-pacific partnership , a trade agreement that us president barack obama has committed to the tpp last year . in that scenario , both japan and south korea would need to find some means to bridge a sino-centric asia and a us-centered pacific .
as premier pan-european institution of union states , the ecb is uniquely positioned to play the role of leadership in europe , and therefore can not play the role of the chief economist . for the boj , the fundamental problem , like that of the premier pan-european institute , is its deep institutional fear of rocking the boat politically and therefore its inability to play the role of the chief economist . but , while it quietly makes a certain number of important technical contributions to different debates , it is hemmed in politically , and thus can not reach forcefully beyond its jurisdictions . this is an unfortunate limitation of the ecb ’s designs by a group of nation-states that has yet to decide whether it favors greater unity or greater decentralization . as a result , america ’s fed chairman today commands a super-normal course .
those outcomes foreshadowed the study last year , by anne case and angus deaton , which showed that life expectancy was on the decline for large segments of the population – including america ’s so-called bright men of the rust belt . but , with incomes below 90 % having stagnated for near a third of a century ( and falling for a substantial share ) , health figures simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large swaths of the country . and while america may be at the extremes of this trend , things were relatively better elsewhere in the world . why did the backlash within america come just as the economy seemed on the mend rather than earlier ? but , if it appeared clear that there would be political consequences , their form and timing were far less obvious .
indeed , both israel and the united states remain adamant about excluding hamas from the annapolis process , unless and until it recognizes israel ’s right to exist , while hamas will not abandon its own identity as a resistance movement merely into joining negotiations that seem unlikely to satisfy the palestinian people ’s minimal demands . it would require bold statesmanship to turn the cease-fire with hamas into the prelude to political talks . it would require bold statesmanship to turn the cease-fire with hamas into the prelude to political talks . it would require bold statesmanship to turn the cease-fire with hamas into the prelude to political talks . indeed , both israel and the united states remain adamant about excluding hamas from the annapolis process , unless and until it recognizes israel ’s right to exist , while hamas will not abandon its own identity as a resistance movement merely to rejoin negotiations that seem unlikely to satisfy the palestinian people with minimal demands .
specifically , germany , europe has some of the greatest economic power , and france , the intellectual progenitor of european unification , should announce their simultaneous exit from the euro , and re-adopt the deutsche mark or the franc . this would unleash the deutsche mark ’s immediate revaluation , and perhaps the swiss franc , relative to the euro . regardless of their decisions , price competitiveness for the eurozone ’s weaker economies would improve greatly . for their part , other eu member countries would need to decide whether to retain the euro in their own strange form , or re-enter into their own national currencies , perhaps pegging them to a revived deutsche mark or the franc . of course , france and germany would need to implement interim arrangements to safeguard their respective banking systems in a ’ stability .
none of this would have been possible had iran ’s antiquated muslim rulers been unable to allow academic freedom and free exchange of thought and expression – something that is sowed within today ’s islamic republic . hence , islamist revolutionaries in 1979 made the point of preserving “ zoroastrian fire temples . ” in their muslim era , iran boasted of some of the largest poets , writers , and researchers from around the world . other autocratic rulers in the muslim world learn from iran ’s example , cracking down hard on intellectuals , journalists , lawyers , women activists , or – or only – anyone with ideas and eager to exchange it with others . for such muslim rulers , intellectuals are the new global terrorists , bombarding their regimes with intellectualism .
its direct ties to us president barack obama , russian president vladimir putin , and european leaders would distinguish it from existing arrangements . to ensure broad membership and transparency across europe and within existing structures , the leadership group should include an agent from the osce , the european union , the eurasian economic union ( emu ) , and nato . a leadership team would thus constitute an important public showdown over governments with core groups of states – for example , france , germany , italy , poland , russia , sweden , ukraine , the united kingdom , and the united states – directly empowered and linked to their presidents and prime ministers . its direct ties to us president barack obama , russian president vladimir putin , and european leaders would differentiate it from existing arrangements . a leadership group ’s first priority would be to address the current crisis .
finally , there are two big differences between the 1930s and the present . just as some confidence returns to the eventually recapitalized the banking system and the longer-run bond yields collapse with the collapse in inflation , mortgage and other borrowing rates will fall , and the mechanisms of currency transmission will revive , support economic activity and stabilizing real house prices , albeit at substantially lower levels . the other crucial difference is that we know enough not to repeat the mistakes , particularly in trading protectionism , of the 1930 ’s . the extreme rise in real-estate prices was a major cause of the current recession , and its reversal will be a drag on the recovery . the industrialized world today is far more dependent on ( mostly foreign ) oil than it was then .
madrid – terrorists struck europe with a vengeance , where the million refugees fleeing wars and hunger are springing up european institutions and straining social cohesion . of course , our expectations will always be in tension with reality . populist movements have emerged , calling for closed borders and new wall street , and their rejection of expertise led heldin to an all-too-grim truth ” : that “ we can no longer take it for granted that people have faith in science , facts , and even knowledge . ” but dark clouds have spun themselves on the horizon . scientists have tumbled about a vengeance , while the number of refugees fleeing wars and hunger is re-sold off european institutions and straining social cohesion .
denver – the agreement on syria ’s chemical weapons has been reached by between russia and the united states is important not so much for what it could mean on the ground that remains to be seen as inspectors start to flow into syria , and the us hopes , chemical-weapons stockpiles are beginning to be destroyed . rather , the deal ’s major significance consists in it hit out at the same time : us secretary of state john kerry has met with his russian counterpart , sergei lavrov , in geneva that most traditional of his diplomatic venues , and cut an agreement on intensive mutual interest matters . a cooperative us-russia relationship is essential if the international system , now almost dysfunctional , is to work properly on the future . in the days , weeks and months ahead , the arrangements to remove chemical weapons from syria will , one hopes , trigger a new era , in which america and russia are working together on other pressing global issues , as well . the syria agreement might accomplish something else : americans might recognize that , amlo , and behold , there are alternative ways of solving problems than by sowing bombs .
capital is in a much better position than labor , because capital is more mobile . to be sure , transnational corporations enjoy the flexibility of transfer pricing and can exert pressure at a time when new investment decisions are made ; but their flexibility does not correspond to the freedom that have been enjoyed by international portfolio investors . moreover , financial capital is better situated in the global system than industrial capital ; once a plant exists , moving it is difficult . the rewards of global capitalism are unevenly distributed . the rewards of global capitalism are unevenly distributed .
as i explain in january 2015 , brent crude oil spot prices are less subject to speculative fluctuations , and are thus a purer approximation to underlying commercial supply and demand factors . for my part is uncertain ; but i would not be surprised if this happened . the graph i prepared , made before the most fundamentals-based oil-price acceleration in early november , shows the level of five-year forward oil prices taking place after a period of some stability . likewise , as i explained in june 2015 , brent crude oil spot price is less subject to speculative fluctuations and is thus a purer approximation to underlying commercial supply and demand factors . for my part , i know very uncertain ; but i would be surprised if this happened .
the dpj was established in 1998 as the “ jambalaya ” party consisting of people who had abandoned the ldp , including hatoyama himself , and the reformer ’s former socialist party . the biggest problem with hatoyama ’s government , however , is that the dpj took power in the absence of a coherent national security policy . the dpj was established in 1998 as the “ jambalaya ” ” party , consisting of people who had abandoned the ldp , including hatoyama himself and the former socialist party . this does not amount to a coherent program of government , and prime minister yukio hatoyama ’s administration was quick to expose the dpj ’s fundamental hollowness . this should not have surprised anyone .
preparing effective national defense is unthinkable without a greater or lesser degree of participation by all national institutions . the region ’s new republics face no concrete or visible enemy . as a result , many regard defense expenditures a luxury , if not a outright waste of money . what is needed , then , is a reminder of time and again that defending the state means , first and foremost , defending the human dignity of every one of us . as a result , many consider defense expenditures a luxury , if not outright waste of money .
with new discoveries leading to patents and licenses , the resulting research could spur the emergence of new agribusinesses and farm-related industries . increased investment in soil research could also have spillover benefits for african economies . my own work on soil microbes at auburn led to the issuance of three american patents , with several us agricultural companies pursuing law rights to commercialize technology ’s products . i can personally vouch for the power of spillover benefits from this type of research . more investment could enable researchers to uncover new microbial strains with their unique abilities to influence soil and crop health locally , thereby leveraging africa ’s own natural environment to improve agricultural productivity .
iran also supported america in its war to de-pose the taliban in afghanistan . iran backed the us during the first gulf war but was left out of the madrid peace conference . and , when american forces overran saddam hussein ’s army in the spring of 2003 , encircled the iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table , from the nuclear question to israel , from hezbollah to hamas . the iranians also pledged to halt the containment of the israeli-arab peace process . in the us-iranian equation , it was the u.s. , not iran , that pursued rigid ideological diplomacy .
still , russia , china , and the rest of the world will not let a return to american hegemony . america , too , has a long history of pursuing its military supremacy . in 2002 , it unilaterally abrogated the 1972 anti-ballistic missile ( abm ) treaty . and , more recently , it has embarked on a massive buildup of conventional forces and a large-scale modernization of its nuclear arsenal . putin has recently made this plain of unveiling the number of a new , cutting-edge strategic weapons systems , as part of what i would call the “ preemptive deterrence ” strategy .
in copenhagen , however , the structure established by the lisbon treaty has failed . beyond setbacks in copenhagen , the eu has a few other problems . it tends to be perceived globally as super-cilious , petreable , and prim . with only 7 % of the world ’s population ( and fast-growing dwindling ) and comprising mainly from post-industrial , more low-growth economies , the eu is increasingly viewed as peripheral . its know-it-all attitude grates almost everywhere .
but bigger companies also have a larger capacity to be a force for good , locally and globally . when the world of the largest firms and most well-recognized brands take seriously their responsibilities as buyers , sellers , and manufacturers , making a firm ’s commitment to act on core values , others tend to follow , or risk being left behind . the same is true of us wages and labor practices , and those of many accounts have not . those that are operating in an ethical way , seeking to improve the lives of all who are related to the manufacture , marketing , and distribution of their products , will benefit kudos , a more entrepreneurial , or simply not being singled out as a bad actor . if a company the size of the us retailer walmart decides that it wo n’t permit wasteful packaging , its purchasing power will lead to regime change in packaging at its entire retail sector .
this can be seen most clearly in my own country , pakistan . but most decisions about how to spend the money they receive are being made outside the country . simply put , western countries ’ current approach does not work . despite the massive increase in aid dollars in recent years , including the billions authorized by former president barack obama , those on the ground are largely cut off from the delivery process . there are roughly 70 separate local-government aid offices , and some 40 international ngos involved to provide aid to pakistanis .
in his meeting with ceos of major oil - and gas companies , francis told them , “ our desire to secure energy for all must not result in the undesired effects of storms of extreme climate change , due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures , a harsher environment , and rising levels of poverty . ” the same kind of corruption of purpose induces the canadian government to guarantee a new pipeline to export output from its polluting and expensive asia ’s oil sands , while under-investing in canada ’s vast renewables resources . and he reminded executives that , “ civilization requires energy , but energy use must not ruin civilization ! ” by doing so , francis has underscored the moral dimension of the problem : francis has underscored it , we must recognize the importance of seeking to ensure that most fossil-fuel projects are cut underground . accordingly , francis has underscored the moral dimension of the issue :
the resulting epizootic ( animal epidemic ) affected more than 280,000 cows . kuru was transmitted through the cannibalistic rituals that had been commonplace in papua new guinea until the 1950 ’s . similarly , in the united kingdom and elsewhere , there was healthy cattle in feed meat and bone made from infected cattle . and a near-identical business , invariably deadly , kuru , ravaged the aboriginal people in papua new guinea throughout the twentieth century . both kuru and scrapie are infectious , and none of which are likely to be infected with hiv .
this includes those reliant on bank credit , as well as many mortgage-holders with extremely high legacy interest rates and balances that transcend their homes ’ value . from every angle , the extremities of this state of affairs – in which those with access to credit do n’t really need it , and those who can not get it – are highly problematic . all of this slows down social mobility , tears already-stretched safety nets , worsens inequality , and accentuates genuine concerns about the functioning and sustainability of today ’s global economic system . on its own , the extremities of this state of affairs – in which those with access to credit need not come first , and those who can not get it – are highly problematic . should left unattended , it leads to gradual and then accelerating , renewed deleveraging , with the economic system ’s highest first-round costs , longer unemployment and growth crises – borne disproportionately by those least able to contain .
by the early 1990 's , it had become increasingly apparent that the armed struggle for power in latin american countries was winding up . only a few groups remained : the shining path in peru , manuel rodríguez patriotic front in chile , for a short time the zapatistas in chiapas in chiapas , mexico , and the farc in colombia . everywhere else , for whatever reason – misguided strategies , tactical flaws , erroneous theories , us military interventions , etc. – confronted only with defeat , repression , and futility . everywhere else , for whatever reason -- misguided strategies , tactical flaws , erroneous theories , us military interventions , etc. -- they faced only defeat , repression , and futility . democratic transitions throughout the hemisphere made frigid unjustifiable : as che foretold in his la guerra de guerrillas in 1962 , wherever the trappings ( or , one might add , the realities ) of democratic rule prevailed , adopted arms were pointless .
the only political space left behind for fascism was its petit bourgeoisie : shopkeepers , small businessmen , and low-level civil servants . today , the social basis of left-right politics has vanished . european fascism collapsed with germany ’s defeat in 1945 , but less aggressive forms have been living on elsewhere , like argentina ’s with its peronism . at that time , the working classes dependably backed parties of the far left . the social base of interwar fascism made it reasonable to see this as a party of the far right .
putting this aside , let us suppose that the decision before tsipras was so crucial and complex that he merited the exceptional referendum step . it was meant to be a careful and deliberate move . it was supposed to be organized and conducted with due respect for the stakes involved , with the government ensuring that adequate information was relayed toward the greek people . instead , greece got a hastily arranged referendum . in that case , the event should have reflected that complexity .
for some , the moral framework offered by human rights is ample in itself ; but for others , as william galston of the brookings institution notes , “ the language of human rights hardly exhausts the realm of moral and spiritual goods . ” in other words , culture plays a much larger role in shaping human-rights interpretations than of many realize , which implies that human-rights practitioners should take comfort in passing judgment on any practice with deep cultural or religiously motivated roots . moreover , various communities prioritize human rights in different ways . for some , the moral framework that human rights provide is ample in itself ; but for others , as william galston of the brookings institution notes , “ the language of human rights hardly exhausts the realm of moral and spiritual goods . ” like the yale cultural psychologist richard shweder notes , circumcision has featured large-scale conflicts between europeans and middle easterners for centuries .
new delhi – there is something about the number five in sino-indian relations . now china ’s new leaders have enunciated a new pancha sheela , with president xi jinping offering a “ five-point proposal ” ” for sino-indian relations . the updated principles would maintain strategic communication and a healthy bilateral relationship ; harness one another ’s strengths and expand infrastructure cooperation ; investment and other areas ; deepen cultural ties and enhance cross-cultural understanding and friendship ; and expand coordination in multilateral affairs to safeguard developing countries ’ legitimate interests and address global challenges ; and accommodate one another ’s core concerns and reconcile bilateral disagreements amicably . asia ’s two giants have long defined their relationships with sheela ’s famous pancha : mutual respect for one another ’s territorial integrity and sovereignty ; mutual non-aggression ; mutual non-interference in each other ’s internal affairs ; equality and mutual benefits ; and peaceful co-existence . in fact , india would happily embrace each of these core principles .
this extreme free-market ideology , also called “ structural adjustment , ” has gone against the practical lessons of china ’s development achievements and the rest of asia . the outcome has been a catastrophe in africa , with farm productivity stagnant for decades . the practical development strategy recognizes that public investment – in agriculture , health , education , and infrastructure – is necessary to complement private-sector investment . for 25 years , the bank has tried to bring african governments out of agriculture , leaving impoverished peasants to fend for themselves . the practical development strategy recognizes that public investment – in agriculture , health , education , and infrastructure – is necessary to complement private-sector investment .
in the run-up to the next year ’s us presidential election , putin will not hesitate to take advantage of leeway with foreign leaders . already , he has ensured that opposition leader alexei navalny was convicted of embezzlement , giving the government a pretext to bar him from the ballot . putin ’s authority may appear unshakeable , but it is actually being propped up by propaganda and fear-mongering . meanwhile , the perception that he has america on the ropes enables putin to continue to silencing his adversaries . putin ’s authority may appear unshakeable ; but , in fact , he is flailing against propaganda and fear .
throughout europe , calling for “ affordable energy ” quickly becomes a euphemism for increased fossil-fuel subsidies and a rollback of green-energy commitments . throughout europe , calls to use “ affordable energy ” quickly grow a euphemism for increased fossil-fuel subsidies and a rollback of green-energy commitments . nowadays , there are openly attacks on political leaders that are “ burdensome ” green taxes . today , too , political leaders are openly attacking “ burdensome ” green taxes . five years ago , britain broke the international mold by enacting legislation mandating 80 % cuts in its greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 .
at the same time , given the rapid population aging , china ’s demographic dividend has all but dissipated . moreover , the ccp can no longer count on rising prosperity to sustain public support . rampant corruption and rising inequality , combined with obvious environmental decay , is causing ordinary chinese – especially the middle class , which once had high hopes for reform – to become increasingly disillusioned . moreover , the ccp can no longer count on rising prosperity to sustain public support . kleptocracy of government officials , their families , and well-connected businessmen have been replicating the chinese state and intent on blocking whatever reforms might threaten its privileged status .
meanwhile , no other nuclear-armed state has voiced the slightest interest in bilateral or multilateral reductions negotiations until the two major powers , which currently hold more than 95 % of their stockpile , go even further . apart from another reasonably productive nuclear security summit in seoul in march 2012 , the news on the disarmament front over the past year has certainly been gloomy . negotiations to “ de-alerting ” the 2,000 nuclear weapons that remain at absurdly dangerous , cold war-era launch readiness never actually began . further us-russia arms-reduction ground to a halt long before the american presidential election season began . no other nuclear-armed state , meanwhile , has voiced the slightest interest in bilateral or multilateral reductions negotiations until both major powers , which currently hold about 95 % of their world stockpile , are sure to be dismal .
colombia ’s hostage rescue mission went so far as to force chávez , still recovering from last year ’s failed power-grab referendum ( a moment when chávez ’s own army high command supposedly rejected his demand to fudge the outcome ) sowed waves of defections from the farc , now down to 9,000 guerrillas from the peak of 16,000 in 2001 . but the advantages of uribe ’s apparent defeat of the farc extend well beyond colombia . indeed , many farc defectors now favor battling for their cause at the ballot box under the new left-wing polo alternativo democratico . colombia ’s hostage rescue mission went hand in hand with uribe ’s popularity and a surging economy for the first time in more than three decades , the normality for colombia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s cities and , increasingly , the peace and the rule of law to much of its sprawling regions of the regions . it has transformed a country in the grip of narcotics barons and on the brink of becoming a failed state .
but the reality remains that a significant share of the world ’s 30 million displaced children , 12 million of whom are refugees , will go through their school-age years , without ever having set foot in a school . around the world , 35 conflict zones , and another million children currently are being denied both education and the prospect of their future employment . clearly , these are the aid of international education will have to rise . but , with a $ 40 billion annual funding gap for primary and secondary education alone , it is also clear that we need a new approach . in addition to mobilizing private-sector finance , the us must make its already accessible aid ( $ 13 billion this year ) far further than it has in the past , by creating the incentives for recipient governments to increase their own investments in education .
and , indeed , a substantial portion of greece ’s government debt has migrated from banks to robust public institutions like the european central bank and the international monetary fund . in that sense , those public institutions have already largely bailed out private institutions . but the risks have not been mitigated , owing to the need to address the downside . the dislocations over the failings of major banks and other financial institutions are narrow . because they are still not being capitalized strongly , the modest losses from direct default and indirect losses by companies with business in greece may threaten bank equity , causing bankers to cut back on lending .
by forecasting medications needs , aggregating orders , and fostering competition in combination with intense advocacy , policymakers and providers were able to secure market efficiencies . it would be useful , for example , for programs to monitor how many high-volume , high-margin solutions diagnosed , low-volume , low-margin solutions were diagnosed . as a result , these efforts drove down the cost of annual hiv treatments , from just over $ 10,000 per patient in 2001 to slightly less than $ 100 in 2016 . last but not least , aids efforts were likely to expand , owing to strong advocacy and collaborations that reshaped markets for diagnostic and treatment programs . the resulting economies of scale enabled suppliers to shift from low-volume , high-margin solutions to high-volume , low-margin profit models .
just before last year ’s trade talks in cancun had the u.s. made some concessions , so that , in any case , it was no longer the only holdout . just before last year ’s trade talks in cancun , the u.s. made some concessions , so that , in any event , it was no longer the only holdout . the global consensus , reflected in the un commission report , calls for more exemptions , to allow – say , drugs that may be made possible in any case to save a life . on its bilateral trade agreements , however , america demands what is becoming known as the `` trips plus '' that would strengthen its intellectual property rights further , ensuring that countries have only the right to produce inexpensive generic drugs during epidemics and other contingencies . bilateral agreements form the foundations of the enhanced ties of a country 's friendship .
as a result , chinese policymakers have been waiting to see whether america ’s recovery is real . without that exchange-rate adjustments , faster export-led growth would expose the chinese economy to greater risk of overheating . meanwhile , continued expenditure growth in china will not change dramatically . if it does , china ’s exports will grow more quickly . and if its exports will grow more rapidly , they may allow the renminbi to rise .
when i joined the imf at the beginning of the 1980s , discussions with nongovernmental counterparts , about the state or policy work , became discouraged . a similar pivot is needed if the imf is to deliver better on a supra-national set of issues that are now unraveling its policy agenda . in particular , the fund would have to complement its already traditional core constituency of governments and other multilateral institutions ( particularly the world bank ) with its systemically influential subnational and private counterparts . the situation today is a very different one . broader national engagement , with ngos , local media , and a broad collection of policymakers are now viewed as an integral part of effective country advice and program implementation , as is fundamental to the fund ’s “ surveillance ” function under its article of agreements .
and , thanks to the united nations children ’s fund ( unicef ) , the global coalition to protect education from attack , the global education business coalition , and former nigerian finance minister ngozi okonjo-iweala , nigeria has now piloted the concept of safe schools . thirty countries recently signed up to lucens or the safe school guidelines that instruct their military organs how to avoid the use of sex as instruments of warfare . and , thanks to the united nations children ’s fund ( unicef ) , the global coalition to protect education from attack , the global education business coalition , and former nigerian finance minister ngozi okonjo-iweala , nigeria has now piloted the concept of safe schools . thirty countries recently signed up to lucens or safe school guidelines instructing their military bodies how to prevent their schools from becoming stuck in the operation of war . once sluggish to respond , the world acts accordingly .
but the euro ’s two largest policy players , the european central bank and the german government – wanting no part of that agenda – hope that one-quarter of good gdp data is making a trend . just as fiscal austerity implies more recessionary and deflationary pressures in the short run , one would need stronger monetary stimulus in order to offset and enhance domestic demand – via delayed fiscal austerity – in germany . this is why greece is insolvent and a coercive restructuring of its public debt is inevitable . because fiscal austerity implies more recessionary and deflationary pressures in the short run , one would need stronger monetary stimulus in order to offset and enhance domestic demand – via delayed fiscal austerity – can no longer be complacent . the rest of the eurozone is in barely better shape than the periphery : bond vigilantes might not have overwhelmed the bond vigilantes in france , but economic performance , through its delayed fiscal austerity , has been anemic at best .
it is time for france to abandon the indulgence of the french exceptionalism ( the l’exception of france ) , and initiate the serious reforms involving the french electorate . jospin and chirac did nothing to implement a grand liberalization program ( including energy , financial services , and transportation ) agreed among eu members in lisbon in less than two years ago , meaning that the benefits of trade liberalization are being denied france at a time when the public perceives the eu as imposing all sorts of restrictions on the french way of doing business . europeans were thought by the french political class to be the solution . but europe and france could be increasingly catalysts for public resentment . it is time for france to abandon the indulgence of the french exceptionalism ( the l’exception france ) and initiate the serious reforms that engage the french electorate .
a modern version of this explanation holds that the world is changing so fast that national security , and , indeed , national identity , are under threat . people in places like france and poland that worry about national decline , are seeking to blame somebody outside the country . a modern version of this explanation holds that such fears emanate from a real problem . there was certainly much of this type of sentiment during the 1930 ’s , when the populist reaction to the great depression attributed it to sinister international capital forces . people in places like france and poland that worry about national decline seek to blame somebody outside the country .
in his attempt to counter arafat ’s political corruption and microrule , abbas lost whatever chance he must maintain the loyalty of the fatah leadership , newly appointed pa officials , security personnel , and , most important , local militants . his other name , abu mazen , is not a revolutionary name but a reflection of the practice of naming a person as the father of his eldest son . abbas ’s effort to have a primary to elect fatah candidates backfired , owing to fraud and the losers ’ refusal to honor the results . his other name , mazen , was not a revolutionary name , but a reflection of the practice of naming a person as the father of his eldest son . an attempt by a primary to elect fatah candidates backfired , owing to fraud and the losers ’ refusal to honor the results .
new york – for four decades , ledra street in the heartland of nicosia was a symbol of a divided cyprus . last week , i visited the ledra street crossing of the ledra street . it was a window on what the future might bring to bear . and then , two years ago this april , the wall that divided the capital to north and south was opened . slowly , people who had not mingled for 44 years began to renew their ties to retrace one another .
but if the proposals discussed in beijing last month are realized , the resultant could surpass nafta in its degree of integration and relevance to the world economy . moreover , producing the china-japan-south korea fta would most likely trigger a chain-reaction . for example , the momentum could expand the southward and spur asean , which has bilateral ftas with all three countries to join the group . such a turn of events would be equivalent to establishing east asia ’s free-trade area , a asean +3 envisioned some ten years ago . such a turn of events would be equivalent to establishing east asia ’s free-trade area , a asean +3 envisioned about a decade ago .
as a result , adherence to tb drugs is particularly weak , paving the way for the emergence of a multidrug-resistant tb that can no longer treat conventional therapeutic regimes longer . as a result , adherence to tb drug therapy is particularly weak , paving the way for the emergence of the multidrug-resistant ( dr. ) tb that can no longer treat the disease of conventional therapeutic regimes . while treating mdr-tb remains plausible , doing so is inherently arduous , with treatment times of roughly two years , using drugs that are neither as efficient nor as benign as the canonical drug – and at a cost that grows by a factor of ten or more . some 50 million people are now infected with tubercle bacilli , which is their mother . compare this with the antibiotic treatment of , say , a urogenital infection that lasts a few weeks at most .
in a country where money trumps democracy , such legislation has , in effect , become predictably frequent . of course , rising inequality is not inevitable , but it is not inevitable . of course , market forces do play a role , too , but markets are shaped by politics ; and , in america , with its quasi-corrupt campaign-finance system and its revolving door between government and industry , politics is shaped by money . there are market economies that are doing better , both in terms of both gdp and rising living standards for the majority of citizens . for example , a bankruptcy law that privileges derivatives over all else but excludes the discharge of student debt , no matter how ill-gotten , enriches bankers , and impoverishes many at the bottom .
by contrast , former us secretary of state and democratic candidate hillary clinton and prominent republican contender donald trump have been opposing reform of social security and medicare . with so few presidential candidates recognizing the linkage between reforming social security and medicare , and ensuring broadly shared prosperity , america faces major risks . either way , america would face growth-constraining tax hikes and limits on the contributions that public investment can make to the country in the future . either way , america would face growth-constraining tax hikes and limits on the contributions that public investment can make to the country in the future . a progressive redistributive agenda might go further , or a conservative entitlement-reform agenda might fail .
this is precisely what the austrian conservative people ’s party under wolfgang schuessel did not do . the austrians are right that haider-like parties exist in many european countries , in britain , france , even in some scandinavian countries . but in any of these countries , the political discourse of all democratic parties ostracized such racist groups and parties : british conservatives never entered into alliance with the british national front ; the same goes for france , where french conservatives expelled from its own party , which fashioned municipal alliances with le pen ’s deputies . confronted with an election outcome of whether to rejoin the social democrats or haider ’s freedom party , they turned a faustian pact with haider . the austrians are right that haider-like parties exist in many european countries , in britain , france , even in some scandinavian countries .
but even a massive spending program like the $ 900 billion america ’s recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 would add only an additional three percentage points to the debt-to-gdp ratio . the congressional budget office projects that even with no additional legislation would get the debt ratio back up to 91.2 % by 2027 . a military emergency or an economic downturn would invite additional debt-financed spending or tax cuts . it is hard to believe that a 97 % debt ratio would make it harder to reach than a debt ratio of 92 % . a military emergency or an economic downturn would invite additional debt-financed spending or tax cuts .
the african union , too , has responded promptly . its peace and security council has met , invoking the au ’s categorical rejection of any attempt to create a fait accompli that undermines the electoral process . ecowas chair and nigerian president goodluck jonathan have called on all parties to “ hold those acting in order to thwart the democratic process , ” and appeals to all stakeholders to acquiesce on the results declared by the electoral commission . the economic community of the west african states ( ecowas ) has strongly condemned any attempt to “ usurp the popular will of côte d’ivoire ’s peoples , ” and appeals to all stakeholders to embrace the results declared by the electoral commission . ecowas chair and nigerian president goodluck jonathan have called on all parties to “ hold those acting together to thwart the democratic process , ” and the will of the electorate accountable to their every action .
seoul – has the world entered a new era of turmoil ? indeed , the sour legacy of invasions by iraq and afghanistan , followed by the 2008 financial crisis , has made the united states not only reluctant to use its military might , even as “ red lines ” have been crossed , but also ostensibly unwilling to shoulder any serious burden in maintaining its global leadership position . to be sure , america ’s vacillating politics toward syria suggests so far . but , if america is no longer willing to lead , who takes its place ? china ’s leaders have shown their lack of interest in active global leadership by openly rejecting calls to become a “ responsible stakeholder ” in the international political and economic systems .
our research shows that industrial policies have been successful in fostering a competitive bioethanol industry in brazil . but it would n’t have worked without the critical role that competition has played . ethanol accounts for more than 50 % of the country ’s current-account fuel demand , and petrobras – brazil ’s ’s energy giant and one of latin america ’s largest companies – expects this share to go up to more than 80 % by 2020 . brazil has been attempting to become energy self-sufficient in ways similar to other countries ’ modern efforts . a massive stimulus package prompted by the 1970s brent oil price spikes gave rise to an entirely new industry .
the sad truth is that families are often the last thing that they will protest their children ’s exploitation . the ilo contends that children suffer enormously when they are forced to perform as “ little adult adults . ” “ a child ’s creativeness and an ability to transcend reality are blunted , ” “ states one ilo report , ” and his whole mental world is impoverished . pakistani parents sometimes maim their children into submission as “ smallholder adults . ” pakistani parents on occasion maim their children into submission as “ smallholder adults . ”
japan alone has foreign-exchange reserves of around $ 750 billion , much of that in us treasury bills . because of bush ’s tax cuts and military spending that contributed to budget deficits of $ 500 billion a year , america will need to raise taxes and curb budget spending , whether or not bush is reelected . because of bush ’s tax cuts and military spending , which contributed to budget deficits of $ 500 billion a year , america will need to raise taxes and curb budget spending , whether or not bush is re-elected . after all , asia ’s central banks have purchased hundreds of billions of dollars of american securities . but , despite its wealth and military might , america ’s ability to project political power – for good or ill – will decline in future years , for at least five reasons : america ’s budget is in crisis .
in 2001 , then-malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad tried to introduce a “ gold dinar ” as an answer to an us-based currency system . to be sure , there have been a long history of policymaking in order to undermine or replace the us dollar as the dominant global currency . with the exception of putin , the most alluring alternative appears to have come as the kind of gold standard . so far , however , no globally devastating monetary attack has been reached outside the sphere of the psychonography . russian theorists of eurasia ” often tout traditional russian iconography ’s use of a fine metal .
to be sure , a single short seller can not “ make ” asset prices ( unless he is george soros , whose famous bet against the british pound in 1992 made him the billionaire , forcing britain out of the european exchange-rate mechanism ) . but if a string of speculators decides ( rightly or wrongly ) that a government ’s debt is overpriced , they can cause its price to spike , thereby forcing its yields ( the interest rate on which the government has had to pay ) . if the attack persists , speculators can force a government default on its debt unless and until it can find ways to finance its borrowing more cheaply . voilà – a successful “ short ” trade metric – is a successful one . my profits for correctly taking this bearish view are thus € 1.65 m – € 9.1 m i got by selling the bonds when i borrowed on january 1 , minus the € 7.2 meters that i had to repurchase them on june 30 , minus the € 250,000 in interest that i had to pay goldman sachs for the six-month loan .
doubts about the chinese government ’s willingness to shift economic policy from tightening to stimulus have been dispelled in recent weeks . to the extent that tariffs did reduce china ’s exports , the government and the central bank can offset the economic impact by stimulating domestic demand . clear pronouncements by policymakers , every way up to xi signaled that china will not allow any further weakening of the economy next year , even if that means accepting bigger budget deficits or loosening up for bank deleveraging and monetary tightening . the slowdown in chinese economic growth later this year was the result almost entirely of deliberate decisions to deleverage the banking system , cut local governments ’ borrowing , reduce over-investment in infrastructure , and curb booming house prices through monetary policy . all of these austerity policies can be easily softened or reversed .
this was the age of the village blacksmith , the weaver , potter , and the cobbler . in the eighteenth century , shipping technology did better enough to enable the creation of global supply chains . cotton was one of the first industries to witness this shift . african slaves were being exploited to grow cotton in the south united states , which was then shipped to english mills . cotton was one of the first industries to witness this shift .
like a blade of grass beneath a stone , culture knows how , and in which direction , to seek light , it can not be “ represented . ” such obscurantism only creates a culture of stultifying uniformity . it need not be “ represented ” by the lone political party ? i do n’t know what “ the progressive direction of sophisticated advanced culture ” is , but the advanced culture has played none in this ccp-inspired “ wipe out the poisonous weeds campaign , ” the “ anti-rightist movement , ” or “ eliminating the demons and the evil heresy campaign . ” that need not be “ represented . ”
in 2006 , president ollanta gun obasanjo , then nigeria ’s president , was among the first to do so . other leaders , from gambia ’s president yahya jammeh to zimbabwe ’s robert mugabe , articulated the same vein . indeed , the cost of homophobia for gay people in many african countries is all the more starkly apparent : legal penalties , social ostracism , and mob justice . other leaders , from gambia ’s president , yahya jammeh to zimbabwe ’s robert mugabe , spoke in the same vein . such official attitudes induced major suffering for africa ’s gays and lesbians .
china ’s explanation of its push to establish the aiib is that developing countries have inadequate access to capital for infrastructure . will it turn out to be the china-led asian development bank and china , or will it pursue the multilateral agenda in the manner that the world bank and regional development banks like the asian development bank ( adb ) and the africa development bank ( afdb ) ? perhaps more important , they have an inadequate voice at the world bank , the international monetary fund , and the adb . perhaps more important , they do have an inadequate voice at the world bank , the international monetary fund , and the adb . that underscores a major concern among development economists and observers alike in international relations like the aiib ’s birth approaches .
at the international monetary fund ’s annual meeting in october , the fund ’s chief economist , olivier blanchard , fueled the controversy by pointing out that , in recent times , governments have tended to underestimate the adverse growth effects of fiscal consolidation . they typically predicted that to bring down public spending by a dollar would reduce gdp by up to 50 cents in the short run ; by blanchard , the true result in current conditions is a decline from 0.90-1.70 . that makes a large gulf state , but it is also a confused discovery : how can such much more uncertainty occur ? contrary to what such forecasting disparities may suggest , economists really know much about the effects of fiscal policy on fiscal policy at least far more than they have used it to know . until the 1980 ’s , it was routinely supposed that the so-called “ multiplier ” – the ratio of gdp to changing government spending – was stable and bigger than one .
but , because the public is educated about the concrete threats that nuclear weapons will continue to pose to the cities in which they live , this attitude will become increasingly difficult to maintain . military planners who regard the use of nuclear weapons as pawns on the global nuclear chessboard , with little concern for the full implications of play in the game . at the same time , there must be suggestions of their actual use . military planners considering the use of nuclear weapons have probably given scant thought to those living in the cities in which they live , that stance becomes harder to maintain . at the same time , those worldwide have had to stop regarding one another as untrusted enemies .
moreover , right-wing populist parties have taken advantage of growing public frustration with the eu itself . many european citizens oppose the idea of “ more europe , ” ” ” ” ” the eu ’s mantra in two major party families , the european people ’s party ( epp ) , and the social democrats . these groups have managed to capitalize on the economic and social pain felt in many eu member states , especially given that the majority of europeans remain unconvinced that the worst is over . and the massive prosperity gulf between the “ old ” and the “ new ” eu member states continues to identify the voting patterns . the influence of widening turmoil among the eu ’s affluent stand out as well as the stumbling “ south ” and the stumbling “ south , ” ” ” ” ” with france in the middle ( but heading south ) .
no , this is far rarer and costlier : it is pulverized by the horn of the white rhino . a half-century ago , white rhinos , blast in africa , was ablaze . today , the international union for nature-based conservation estimates that just 25,000 still roam the continent , most of them in south africa , with a few tenfold in namibia and kenya . they raise their spectacles filled with finest scotch , which has been sprinkled with a fine powder . not gold powder , as lesser moguls might offer , nor even purest cocaine .
dubai – the global financial crisis has taught the world much more than it has . in today ’s ’s ’s ’s crisis of extremism , we must recognize that we are just as interdependent as our security is recognized in the current struggle to defeat isis . the world must unite behind a holistic drive to discredit an ideology that affords extremists their power , by restoring hope and dignity to those whom they would recruit . if we are to prevent isis from teaching us that lesson the harshest channel , we must acknowledge that we can not extinguish the fires of fanaticism by itself alone . to be sure , isis can – and will , be sure – be defeated militarily by an international coalition that is assembling and which the uae actively supports .
this year ’s nobel prize in economic sciences went to george akerlof of the university of california at berkeley , michael spence of stanford university , and myself for our work on the `` asymmetry in information . '' they knew that information was imperfect , but hoped that a world with moderate imperfections of information would actually be akin to a world with consummate information . for two hundred years , economists were using simple economic models that held that held that information was perfect -- i.e. , that all participants had equal and transparent knowledge about the relevant factors . we showed that this notion was greatly ill-set : even small information imperfections could have profound effects on how the economy behaved . how is it that work about , and why have we been committed ?
we are accustomed to thinking of a government transferring money from the well off to the poor . it certainly did n’t serve homeowners who are losing their homes , workers who had lost their jobs , pensioners who saw their retirement funds going vanish , or taxpayers who had bailed out hundreds of billions to bail out the banks . under the threat of the whole system ’s collapse , the safety net , intended to help unhappy individuals meet everyone ’s resource constraints , was extended generously to commercial banks , then to investment banks , insurance firms , auto companies , even car-loan companies . the bankers ’ pursuit of self-interest ( greed ) did n’t actually make a society ’s well-being central ; nor did they serve their shareholders and bondholders well . never had so much money been transferred from so many to so few .
importantly , the constitution requires a kind of super-majority – rather than , say , an easily irreversible “ non-bloc ” resolution that ukraine adopted in 2010 – to join a military alliance . what is significant is that the constitution requires a kind of super-majority – rather than , say , an easily irreversible “ non-bloc ” resolution that ukraine adopted in 2010 – to join a military alliance . this approach would adhere to a principle that us president barack obama highlighted when announcing the latest round of sanctions against russia last month that ukraine must be allowed to chart its own path . above all , it would help ukraine ’s people – divided between inherently antagonistic identities – to live together peacefully . ukraine ’s position may , of course , change in the future , with cultural , demographic , and economic shifts producing the needed consensus to abandon neutrality .
under any viable long-term arrangement , levels of benefit relative to wages should fall , the retirement age should rise to international norms and the eligibility for special pensions ( disability ones in particular ) to cover the more reasonable proportion of gdp . political elites -- at home and from abroad -- will need to shift public attention to the looming fiscal crisis . in any viable long-term arrangement , the level of benefits relative to wages should fall , the retirement age should rise to international norms and the eligibility for special pensions ( disability ones in particular ) should be tightened to cover only the really need . in coming years , the most important fiscal task facing east european and slovak governments will be to reduce the size of their social expenditures to a more reasonable proportion of gdp . the general public should understand the crucial difference between a one-time transfer of the old workers at the start of market reform and a long run of pension policies .
but that may well follow the second stage , in which tight labor markets , populist nationalism , and industrial concentration start to offset the one-time structural effects of new technologies are widely adopted . as with most paradigm shifts , there can be little assurance of the timing of this scenario . but either way , policymakers in advanced economies must recognize that their underlying inflation outlook is subject to a wider range of dynamic options than one that has previously been deemed so far . and , on a third stage , the potential onset of higher inflation can catch policymakers and investors by surprise , producing excessive reactions that are wreaking havoc on the downside . focusing too much on keynesian rather than structural will pose severe risks to future economic wellbeing and financial stability .
the groups would operate under a common mandate across all un agencies , and they would be led by un operations executive directors in each country . a fifth step should be to integrate women fully and equally within all parts of the un agenda , not only in discrete areas pertaining to women ’s ” ” ” ” ” ” ” issues . a fifth step should be integrating women fully and equally within all parts of the un agenda , not only in discrete areas pertaining to women ’s ” ” ” ” issues . the un ’s manifold agendas – peace and security , sustainable development , human rights , and humanitarianism – must be integrated into one strategic continuum , rather than remaining rigid , self-contained institutional silos . a fifth step should be to integrate women fully and equally within all parts of the un agenda , and confront the appropriate challenges .
with an estimated 268 million people living in extreme poverty in a recent survey from 2011 , india is home to one of the largest rates of any poor people on the planet , on average . so the most expensive countries where to end poverty would be the democratic republic of the congo and nigeria . for india , the costs add up to almost $ 11 billion per day below the extreme-poverty line . each is on an average of 38 cents per day below the extremes of poverty . with an estimated 268 million people living in extreme poverty in the most recent survey from 2011 , india is home to the largest number of poor people on the planet , on average .
in recent decades , however , macroeconomic policy in most developing countries has become more pro-cyclical , largely exacerbated volatility in international financial markets and commodity prices . pro-cyclical fiscal adjustment tends to encourage a short-run orientation toward economic policy that limits long-term investment in infrastructure and human capital , thereby constraining growth . more fiscal space can be generated by improved governance and the strengthening of the tax base and , for the poorest countries , by achieving additional , stable official development assistance ( oda ) channeled through national budgets . finally , institutional reform encompasses more than create markets and guaranteeing property rights . indeed , where oda is not dictated by geopolitics , it can have a powerful positive effect on long-term growth , essentially because it promotes investment in infrastructure and human development .
cocaine used to be america ’s problem , to the point that the united states initiated a major campaign against the sellers and consumers of crack cocaine in inner towns , drug traffickers , and contractors in the andes . “ white lady ” is seducing a steadily rising number of europeans , and remaining in a state of denial will only make the consequences worse . but now the demand for cocaine in much of the world is stable or plummeting . europe ’s leaders need to get serious about europe ’s ’s cocaine problem . coca cultivation has slashed by just a quarter over the last five years , and seizures of cocaine have nearly doubled .
berkeley – it has been one year since donald trump was elected president of the united states , and america ’s democratic institutions are clearly under strain . among congressional republicans , in particular , a “ take-no-prisoners ” minority ” undermines the federal government ’s capacity for action , which is precisely what many on the far right want . a mere 20 % of americans now believe the federal government to “ make the right happen , ” while trust in congress has fallen below 9 % . yet state and local governments still trust a majority of voters and have the power under the american constitution ’s tenth amendment to bolster these democratic institutions . among congressional republicans , a “ take-no-prisoners ” is undermining the federal government ’s capacity for action , which is precisely what many on the far right want .
the european parliament has consistently denounced belarus as europe of the latest dictatorship , yet eu member governments continue business as usual with aleksander lukashenka , a country of wayward and near lunatic despot . for example , for more than a decade , germany ’s police force , the customs service , and even the bundeswehr have been ordering a uniforms from a state-owned factory in dzherzinzinsky , named after the father of the red terror and the founder of the soviet kgb , feliks dzherzinzinzinzinzinzinzinsky . by treating lukashenka as favored business partner on the same as allowing the eu to insulate it as an international pariah , european hypocrisy stands naked . similar examples of such indifferent cynicism abound in the way that the eu and its allies are seeking to isolate him as an international pariah are . this is particularly true when there is an opportunity to save himself or make money .
at the same time , the european central bank unleashed its € 1 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) long-term refinancing operation that pulled the european banking system back from the brink . bond yields in southern europe skyrocketed , giving rise to a pervasive sense of apprehension and fear of cloaked in european capitals . finally , there was decisive action in december . there would be a “ fiscal treaty , ” ” ” ” which would reinforce the stability and growth pact , and , importantly , entail automatic sanctions to ensure that eurozone members stick to these rules . at the same time , however , political leadership was missing .
an analysis by ronald gilson , henry hansmann , and mariana pargendler of brazil ’s ’s novo mercado – the shares swap ’s special voluntary listing segment , which provides strong protections for newly listed firms – supports this view . the novo mercado has dealt with this problem by subjecting disputes involving its newly listed firms to regulatory arbitration . the novo mercado has dealt with this problem by subjecting disputes involving its newly listed firms to regulatory arbitration . but stock exchange has limits , most notably in brazil . in the absence of reliable courts , it is impossible to sue them to enforcing their regulations .
new york – january is traditionally a good time to assess earlier this year ’s developments in order to anticipate what the new one has in store . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . unfortunately , although we may be at a turning point for better politically , the data that have emerged over the past month do n’t paint a promising picture of the global economy ’s ’s short-term prospects . targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and translating comprehensive universities into the specialized institutes of science and technology in the soviet union and the communist china has done nothing to avert economic catastrophe in those economies . obviously , the proliferation of highly specialized universities in europe has done little to buttress economic growth or employment . but , once again , this contradicts the traditional nature of commercial dynamics , in which a single country ’s success does not imply hardship for another . of course , in theory , a simultaneous shift in several countries to already-focused upper classes and higher education , with large concomitant productivity gains , could rein in an economy that has made no such effort available . but , once again , this scenario is highly unlikely , at least in the foreseeable future .
first , all were dealt with by a profound crisis of the social-welfare state : falling output , soaring unemployment , large budget deficits , inflation and devaluation . reform does not require a state of emergency , as is often argued . without a severe crisis , no major reform was too likely to have been possible . second , a change of government through elections has prompted these reforms , giving them democratic legitimacy . third , no major reform was likely in place without a severe crisis .
yet , rather than deploy their abundant cash in new investing to expand capacity and tap new markets that they have been very hesitant in the us since the global financial crisis erupted , many companies have so far preferred ( or pressured by activist investors ) to give it a return to their shareholders . nonfinancial firms have accomplished a mix of resilience and agility that contrasts sharply with the prevailing conditions for some households and governments around the world , which have yet to confront adequately a legacy of over-leverage . indeed , with profitability at or near record levels , corporate holdings in the united states piled up a quarter after a row , reaching all-time highs , and earning very little at today ’s stage of near-zero interest rates . moreover , because us companies have made a significant contribution to their operating efficiency and lengthened maturities on their debt , they need many fewer precautionary savings than they have had in the past . but rather than deploy their abundant cash in new investment to expand capacity and tap new markets that they have been most hesitant to do since the global financial crisis erupted – many corporations have so far preferred ( or have been pressured by activist investors ) to give it a return to their shareholders .
the same applies to turkey , with its robust banking sector , a thriving domestic market , growing significance for the middle east and energy politics , nato membership , european union membership bid , and ties to ethnic cousins across central asia . perhaps the most compelling case for this is that , from indonesia , the world 's largest muslim state , with a rapidly burgeoning middle class , relatively stable democratic politics , and a stellar performer in asia , despite a global recession . indonesia , moreover , has shown resilience not only economically , but also as a nation . from an american perspective , indonesia is an attractive alternative to russia , having lately vied with venezuela for its supposed leadership in the decline of a america 's cheering castes . purely from the standpoint of its economic potential and fundamentals , the case is far stronger for south korea , an ingenious economic power , whose primary responsibility is the danger that a regime of its unhappy twin into the north will collapse and inundate it with starving refugees .
and worst of all , it seems , is that values matter in international relations , with states that place heavy stress on promoting values make them extremely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy . a good example is allegation that the “ responsibility to protect ” of ” is inherently flawed , because major powers will always be immune from intervention , owing not only to the fact that five have the power to assert a security council veto , but also to their own personal military power . but this ignores the principle that no military intervention ever will be legitimate unless it satisfies , among other criteria , the test of the liberation , not destruction , human suffering . the bottom line is that values matter in international relations , and states that place a heavy emphasis on promoting values are extremely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy . no state that aspires to win support or cooperation by others can afford an unambiguous double standard .
already , the country ’s worsening record on democracy and human rights threatens its tariff-free access to european markets , delivered through the bloc to “ everything but arms ” trade regime . the last thing cambodia needs is also the risk of economic reprisal for helping chinese firms dodge american tariffs . yet that appears to be precisely what hun sen ’s government is planning to do . already , the country ’s worsening record on democracy and human rights threatens its tariff-free access to european markets , given how hun sen ’s government will continue to turn a blind eye . this might be good for the sake of the corrupt few , but it is bad for cambodia .
to break free from economic stagnation , we need renewed policy momentum . if action agreed by the leaders assembled at the g20 in november is carried out , this will lift world gdp up by more than 2 % by 2018 , the equivalent of adding $ 2 trillion in global income . already around 200 million people are unemployed , more than half of their global gdp . the global economy ’s risks are getting stuck in the “ new mediocre ” shops – the prolonged period of slow growth and lackluster job creation . at the same time , some important economies are still fighting deflation .
it further rightly suggests that nato ’s strategic political and military objectives could be achieved jointly with russia , through greater stability , mutual transparency , predictability and arms reduction , verified by the non-proliferation and arms-control treaties . again , what type of relations should nato have with its partners ? the albright report tries to address these questions in a balanced way . it endorses policies that capture accurately the relationship between the “ outside of the zone operations ” and the members ’ commitment to their mutual self-defense under article 5 of the north atlantic treaty . should it pursue further simultaneous transformation of the us and nato enlargement ?
one is north korea , whose recent behavior has been smart and delusional . indeed , japan officially endorses the goal of a non-nuclear world , but relies on america ’s extended nuclear deterrent and wants to avoid being subject to north korea ’s nuclear blackmail ( or china ’s ) borders . japan is officially approving the goal of a non-nuclear world , but relies on america ’s extended nuclear deterrent and wants to avoid becoming subject to north korea ’s nuclear blackmail ( or that of china ) . japan fears that the credibility of america ’s extended deterrence will be weakened if america decreases its nuclear force to parity with china . it is a mistake , though , to believe that extended deterrence will depend on parity in nuclear numbers .
berkeley – back in the late 1990 ’s , in america , at least two schools of thought pushed for more financial deregulation – that is , to repealing regulatory separation of investment banking from commercial banking , relaxing banks ’ capital requirements , and stimulating more aggressive creation and use of derivatives . the first school of thought , broadly that of the united states republican party , was that financial regulation was bad , because all regulation was bad . if deregulation seemed like such a bad idea now , why was n’t it then ? the other , broadly that of the democratic party , was rather more complicated and was based on four observation : · in the globalized economy , at least , it was then more than 60 years since financial disruptions had more than a minor effect on overall levels of output and employment .
concentrating on egalitarianism would appeal to the liberals , of course , but it should not alienate moderate voters , either in the sense that more equality is good for the economy . it is grotesque that so many people who stand to benefit so much as a result of such “ socialist ” policies continue to be persuaded to vote against them because they are supposedly “ un-american . ” the democrats ’ core message for the next two years should be that , in a plutocracy , everyone else loses . and may even persuade some angry , poor trump supporters , on the ground , to recognize that his pseudocy is not about helping the far-left behind folks in the rust belt and rural hinterlands . it is about having too little cash .
similarly , trump thought that he could bully iran by abandoning the joint comprehensive plan of action and imposing severe sanctions . but iranians reacted by intensifying their regional provocations , knowing full well that trump can not afford a full-scale war , and the lifeblood of the oil spike that would result from it . as the clock ticks down , a nasty outcome will become more likely . but neither wants iran ’s chicken , ” ” ” ” ” ” because that would undermine its domestic political standing and empower the other side . still , with no deal by year to end , a clash will become likely .
but the scaf now appears to have realized that in a leaderless situation , no civilian politician can grant her immunity without becoming vulnerable to attacks by rivals . moreover , the scaf has carefully weighed policymakers and dissecures their relative weakness , limited capacity , notorious opportunism and general unpredictability . meanwhile , ongoing political polarization , sectarian incidents , a weak economy , and the absence of us security have dimmed egypt ’s prospects for a successful democratic transition . as a result , there is a growing faith within the scaf that its three “ minimum ” demands have become unnecessary and insufficient . in the past two months , the scaf ’s behavior toward civilian politicians , civil-society actors , and , more recently , coptic communities have clearly reflected changing attitude : “ you need immunity , guidance , and protection from the us , not us from you . ”
that requires a weaker dollar to make us goods and services more attractive to foreign buyers and make foreign goods more expensive to american consumers . by the end of the decade , the americans will have to pay the sum equivalent of more than one-third of personal-income taxes simply to pay interest on the national debt . at the same time , foreign investors now hold more than half of that debt . paying interest on their own requires sending more goods and services to the rest of the world than america is receives from the rest of the world . higher debt-service costs demand higher tax rates , which in turn weakens incentives and reduces economic growth .
if ahmadinejad prevails , the dilemma for the west will be to deal with a regime discredited by electoral fraud but remaining indispensable for resolving nearly all of the middle east ’s major problems : iran ’s own nuclear program and conflict in afghanistan , pakistan , lebanon , and palestine . indeed , aside from issues of domestic politics and issues of internal freedom , the choice between the major candidates hinges on the question of whether iran should seek greater international integration . ahmadinejad stands as a policy of confronting and partial isolation ; moussavi stands to gain further . iran is also a key player in cooling those hotspots in the caucasus and central asia . ahmadinejad stands out as a key player in cooling these hotspots and central asia .
if ever there was a country destined to be the poster child of the new orthodoxy in economic development , it was mexico . but where one counts , in terms of overall gdp and economic growth , the story is one of substantial disappointment . since 1996 , per capita economic growth in the us has averaged well under 1.5 % , and total factor productivity has stagnated or declined . exports jumped from 5 % to 30 % of gdp , and the share of gdp inward foreign direct investment tripled . perhaps the most visible gains have been on the external front .
after all , many asian countries have achieved impressive export-led growth under the current one . and bilateral or regional trade deals may chip away at some of the many barriers within the current global system . a fundamental problem , for example , is the ongoing development of the nature of global trade , with existing agreements having only a limited capability to adapt . services such as education , banking , accountant , and insurance account for an ever-larger share of global output ( now around two-thirds ) , and further expansion requires huge changes in existing agreements . even if asia has successful itself by relentlessly exporting matters , today ’s poorest countries , especially in africa , can realistically export only more agriculture and textiles .
most of the time , pain occurs after simple nerve endings detect tissue injury in various ways , and generate techniques that travel to spinal cord and inside the brain . she reminds physicians that for a person suffering the intense grief , what dominates consciousness above all else is powerful negative emotions . a contemporary nonmedical writer described the qualities of intense pain as including extreme thuantness , an ability to annihilate complex thoughts and other sentiments , the capacity to destroy language , and staunch opposition to the objectification . for many years , researchers believed that these signals had traveled along several well-defined routes to reach a relay station in the brain known as the thalamus . she reminds physicians that for a person suffering the intense roadside , what dominates consciousness above all else constitutes powerful negative emotions .
when capital flight forced françois mitterrand to abort his program in 1983 , france ’s socialists performed the abrupt volte-face and embraced worldwide financial liberalization . the first stop was the european union at the end of the 1980 ’s , with two french socialists , jacques delors , and pascal lamy ( the president of the european commission and his assistant , respectively ) leading the way . in the end , the imf joined the bandwagon under michel camdessus , another frenchman serving as governor of france ’s bank of france under mitterrand . then it was the turn of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) organization . according to harvard business school of the study of rawi abdelal , this was a key event that established in motion development , ultimately enshrine freedom of capital movements as the global norm .
de gaulle ’s face was persuaded to leave his stronghold ; the insurrectionary leaders were either detained or escaped to spain . the defeat of the military revolt marked the first time that the paris republican authority was asserted over the pieds noirs who helped to bring down the fourth republic . the men at barricades were persuaded to leave their stronghold ; the insurrectionary leaders were either detained or escaped to spain . de gaulle ’s firmness and rhetoric , aided , must assert himself , by the fumbling of insurgents , established the state ’s primacy . the next day , de gaulle ’s face was drawn , but he was both resolute and full of power .
have the israelis really sought a resurgence of islamist violence in gaza , a potential collapse of peaceful politics on the west bank , and now the right of an recognized palestinian state to take israel into the international criminal tribunal for war crimes ? if not , why are they so ham-fisted ? israel appears to be making the same mistake that others have made . israel ’s diplomatic promotion has offered it a lifeline . it has been proven time repeatedly that military intimidation of civilians will not erode their morale and turn them against their own leaders , however appalling the regime .
the growing role of the un in this process puts the seal of international law and diplomacy in place over the global fight against terrorism , and helps to reassure many countries that this is a true transnational effort – and not just an american that is acting alone . fourth , afghanistan ’s war has not only proceeded quickly on the ground , but has nonetheless led to a diplomatic breakthrough just as well . while these seem to be a grab-bag of achievement , they point to a single message : the global community is finding new ways to work together , even against a backdrop of terrorism and global recession . the un will play a central role in reconstruction of the un working governments in that country , as well as in coordinating humanitarian support for the afghan people . the un ’s growing role in this process puts the seal of international law and diplomacy over the global fight against terrorism and helps reassure many countries that this is a true transnational effort , not simply american acting alone .
except for barely practical political rhetoric from leaders like hugo chávez in venezuela and evo morales in bolivia , there is nothing new on offer in the world ’s electoral marketplace that diverts voters ’ emotions . except for barely the practical political rhetoric of leaders like hugo chávez in venezuela and evo morales in bolivia , there is nothing new on offer in the global electoral marketplace that diverts very far from what is usually called a neo-liberalism or washington consensus . here , brazil is no different from the united kingdom , spain , or uruguay . according to the socialist sociologist francisco de oliveira , coldness of the electoral landscape is closely related to one reality : the “ irrelevance ” of politics as a result of its “ financiarisation . ” indeed , brazil ’s upcoming elections this year are like a soccer match between the big teams where one candidate ’s supporters and others are solely distinguished from their shirts ’ colors , because the strongest teams accept the rules of the game , and even tactics are akin to one
violence against journalists has historically been an issue that has remained behind headlines . but the most consequential changes must come from within the media industry itself . because female journalists have been using their platforms to inform those on the world of the dangers they and their colleagues face , the entire world will need to listen . if journalists use their platforms to inform the world of the dangers they and their colleagues face , the entire world will need to listen . with attacks on the press increase , an old approach , a prideful silence , no longer makes sense .
rome – in 2010 , global leaders met with the millennium development goal ( mdg ’s ) of reducing the proportion of the world ’s poor to half its 1990 level , five years ahead of schedule . but with rising unemployment and falling incomes , they understate the persistent threat of extreme poverty worldwide . after all , “ poverty ” is not an unchanging attribute of a fixed group ; it is a condition that threatens billions of vulnerable people . but the world bank ’s $ 1.25 / poverty line of $ 1.25 a day ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) , which uses progress toward the mdgs ’ ’ ’ ’ poverty-reduction goal , is not the only relevant threshold . moreover , despite their shortcomings , income measures are useful in gaining a better understanding of the scale of poverty and vulnerability globally .
indeed , there is the looming risk of secular stagnation in many advanced economies , owing to the adverse impact on productivity growth of years of under-investment in human and physical capital . and an abundance of policy and regulatory uncertainties will keep private investment spending on a check . the outlook for 2014 is dampened , too . while the eurozone ’s tail risks are lower , its fundamental problems remain unaddressed : low potential growth ; high unemployment ; still-high and rising levels of public debt ; losing competitiveness and a slow fall in unit labor costs ( which a strong euro does n’t help ) ; and extreme credit rationing , owing to banks ’ continuing deleveraging . and the structural reforms that these economies need to boost their potential growth will last a slow for a while .
yes , cyprus needs € 17 billion to remain in the eurozone , whereas its annual gdp is only € 23 billion . but these figures must be placed within the eu ’s dismal global energy picture , something that the ongoing debt negotiations have failed . more immediately , to get gas to market in europe and elsewhere , a gas liquefaction plant costing some € 10 billion must be built , and israeli investors have raised interest rates . the sheer size of cyprus ’s likely energy riches , and the financing needed to develop it dwarfs the country ’s current financial woes . but realizing that value is a long-term proposition , no less .
as a result , for too many people in greece , austerity reflects germany ’s deranged obsession with discipline , rather than their country ’s profligacy . greece ’s largest private media , controlled by the country ’s oligarchs , are happy to oblige . syriza has hardly alone blamed greece for the eu ’s woes . thus , most tv channels talk of the bailout deal just as tsipras does : as the proximate cause of austerity , a result of its neoliberal dogma . new democracy and pasok do a lot of the same , attacking the eu , “ speculators ” and hedge funds , anyone who might deflect popular attention from their own risk to the crisis .
nor is hezbollah keen to see israel ’s end of israel ’s occupation of sheba farms on lebanon ’s border undermine its claims to the formidable , independent military force built with iranian and syrian help . but america ’s dwindling leverage , however , can not match that of the region ’s “ axis of evil . ” after all , it has been minuscule qatar , which has brokered lebanon a domestic settlement , egypt that has mediated a gaza cease-fire , and turkey that is facilitating the israeli-syrian talks . lebanon is simply too vulnerable to pressure from syria and iran , neither of which wants to see their local clients ease up in the hands of israelis of a “ lebanese front ” before their own grievances are addressed . lebanon is simply too vulnerable to pressure from syria and iran , neither of which wants to see their local clients ease with israelis on the burdens of the lebanese front before they resolve them .
but with clarida ’s input , the fed will be more inclined to focus on real-world inflation trends , rather than on the official rate of unemployment and its implications under traditional model . moreover , whereas fed officials tend to believe that america ’s economy will grow at a very low rate ( around 1.75-2 % ) , clarida , like powell , seems open to think that trump ’s ’s tax cuts and deregulatory policies combined with the next wave of technology-driven innovations , will allow for somewhat stronger , non-inflationary growth . last but not least , clarida is spearheading an internal strategy review to determine whether the fed should start making up for below-target inflation during recessions and slow recoveries by permitting above-target inflation during expansionary periods . taken together , these factors suggest that the fed could remain in pause mode for the rest of 2019 . and , though the review continues into its early stages , the fed already seems to have embraced the notion that inflation should be allowed to rise close to 2 % , without triggering immediate tightening .
at fukushima , for example , the bill will include the costs of heroic efforts by hundreds of workers to cool the plant their reactors ; protracted loss of economic output in the 20-kilometer exclusion zone ( estimated at $ 128.5 trillion by roubini global economics ) ; decommissioning and clean-up costs ; and the costs of replacing 4.7 gigawatts of generating capacity . on top of this is the option available to the health-care costs resulting from the exposure of radioactivity . all of these stealth costs drive nuclear energy higher than the price of shifting to renewable energy , and improve energy efficiency . it is governments – and hence taxpayers and bondholders – that financed nuclear plants . moreover , the supposed “ cost saving ” of nuclear power never include the price tag for direct and indirect governmental subsidies , the decommissioning of aging facilities , and the emergency cleanup and the restoration of impacted communities when disasters occur , again at taxpayers ’ expense .
but , clearly , clear rules of engagement are needed . the most important principle that must uphold is the distinction between hearing someone and honoring someone . doing so would run counter to which universities are standing up for . otherwise , they would be stifling debate . as one more pragmatic matter , it would backfire , too , by giving trump ’s camp another opportunity to demonize the “ liberal elite . ”
there was good news at this year ’s summit : european leaders finally understood that the bootstrap operation by which europe lends money to rescue the sovereigns , and to sovereigns to rescue the banks , wo n’t work . moreover , they now recognize that the bailout loans that gave the new lender seniority over other lenders , who will simply demand even higher interest rates . new york – like an inmate on the death row down , the euro – has been receiving another last-minute stay of execution . markets are celebrating , because they have after each of the four previous “ euro crises ” ” ” ” summits until they come to understand that fundamental problems have yet to be tackled . it will survive a bit longer and the next time around .
munich – the german constitutional court has delivered its long-awaited decision on the european central bank to be banned by a “ outright monetary transaction ” scheme . since its launch in 2012 , the omt program has authorized the ecb to purchase , if necessary , unlimited quantities of troubled eurozone countries ’ government bonds , given that affected countries subscribe to the rules of the european rescue fund , the european stability mechanism ( esm ) . thousands of germans appealed to the constitutional court against the omt program , arguing that it violates article 123 of the eurogroup treaty , which bars monetary financing of eurozone governments and that it imposes substantial risks on german people as taxpayers . the court has now declared that it fully embodies the plaintiffs ’ arguments , and that the omt program actually violates eu primary law . but , rather than issuing a formal ruling to constrain the bundesbank and the german parliament , as it may have done , the court asked the european court to do its part .
and equity gains have already dropped by more than 50 % since the 1980s . when investment is in upstream basic research , spillover effects across industries and sectors sometimes suffice to reward societal rewards . to build support for public investment in higher-risk innovations , perhaps taxpayers should get a more direct return , by channeling profits into a public innovation fund to finance the next burst of technology . for example , some of the profits of the us government ’s business investment in tesla might have recovered through its share ( or royalties ) , and used to cover the revenue losses from its solyndra investment . but other cases might require the creation of alternate incentives .
still , there is a broad consensus that the eurozone will be needed more than monetary policy to ensure continued growth and stability . if the ecb ’s next leaders do not meet them , it will be at risk from the euro itself . complicating matters further , by 2020 , the european commission and the european council will each have a new president and leadership teams of their own , and the european parliament will have seated a new generation of politicians addressing the last decade ’s compromises and reform . by contrast , germany will once again be re-elected in a political environment of anger , diminished trust , and intra-european fragmentation . clearly , with interest rates at the zero lower bound , more monetary/fiscal-policy coordination is the must .
we should recall earlier accusations that russia covertly used social media to sway electoral outcomes in ukraine , france , germany , the us , and , most famously , in the united states . in reality , these regimes began to wield social media over their own ends . in the event , most social media-enabled popular uprisings failed for the want of effective leadership , and traditional political and military organizations retained the top hand . facebook has estimated that russian content on its network , including posts and paid ads , has reached 126 million americans , some 40 % of a nation ’s population . we should recall earlier accusations that russia covertly used social media to sway electoral outcomes in ukraine , france , germany , and , most famously , in the united states .
today , however , khamenei has been profoundly regretful of that choice . it is an open secret in iranian political circles that khamenei , too , regrets permitting the volunteers of the basij militia to attack the british embassy last november . in 2005 , mahmoud ahmadinejad relied on khamenei to make financial and political support to win the presidency . ahmadinejad disobeys his bidding , attempts to discredit him with the public by challenging his authority , and undermines key institutions , including the judiciary and parliament . but he is not immune to a miscalculation .
but it is far from clear whether china ’s leaders will recognize that and negotiate in their country ’s own long-term self interests . the us , for their part , must do this just as well . and it is not just the developing and emerging countries that must rethink their attitude toward the rest of the world . a similar set of questions applies to india and brazil . the us , for its part , is not to single out china .
but on the level of individual societies , i believe that inequality does loom as a severe political-economic problem . nor should we worry that some people are becoming richer than others . some people are working harder , apply their intelligence more skillfully , or simply lucky enough to be at the right point at the right point at the right time . the problems that can be tackled are those of poverty and social insurance — of providing a safety net “ not of inequality . ” some people work harder , apply their intelligence more skillfully ; or have simply been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time .
but the real danger lies in the fact that powerful lobbies , working through members of congress , are pushing back hard vis-à-vis the fcsoc and its mandates . not everyone at the sec is as sensible as stein ’s . there is also some friction among america ’s various regulators , and we surely need more coordination across national borders , including with europe . more broadly , however , her point is that we need the fcm to do its job by looking for and assessing all forms of potential systemic risk . this needs to be done as a technical matter , not as part of a political process .
when the results were announced , their euphoria became overwhelming . iohannis perhaps may have benefited , to some degree , from an association in ’ minds with the german hohenzollern kings , who have ruled romania wisely and dedication through more than 80 years . and , indeed , just to learning his victory , iohannis instantly paid a visit to king michael i ( the hohenzollern prince , until he renounced the title in 2011 ) . a final factor , driving iohannis ’s victory , was the younger generation in whom connections with the western world imbued with an eagerness to see real democratic progress in romania . in bucharest of ’s university square , celebration recalled power in 1989 ; it was the sound of an awakened electorate , mindful of its past mistakes , and has been ready for fresh start .
as a result , a chinese graduate from colleges and universities has learned relatively little about the outside world in fields like the anthropocene , sociology , international relations , comparative literature , and history . while tens of millions of chinese young people display impressive innate abilities , the country ’s system of higher education does abysmally work cultivating their talents . for most , the curriculum is mostly obsolete , and skewed toward rote learning of theory at the expense of fundamental analytical , critical-thinking skill development . education in the social sciences and the humanities has been particularly deplorable , owing to the lack of investment in such disciplines , as well as to the excessive politics of control of curricula . unless china reforms its ossified system , the country will be unable to produce enough highly trained talent to compete globally ’s best and brightest .
these reforms will create new markets , spur competition , attract foreign investment and technology transfers , and improve consumer interests . while export-led expansion has delivered growth in this century , import substitution and inward foreign direct investment ( fdi ) will cause japan to pursue greater productivity growth in the next few years . finally , the global economic environment will compel japan to pursue further liberalization of its markets under the wto . like its african counterparts , imports inspire a more competitive domestic business environment . japan has committed to further liberalization of its markets under the wto .
i believe that the west can learn a lot about what to do by studying the policies pursued in the world ’s only two middle-development moslem states , tunisia , and indonesia , because each has successfully avoided becoming prey to islamic fundamentalism . both countries have combined substantial increases in secular education with rapid job creation in labor-intensive manufacturing jobs ; stressed rural development and labor-intensive manufactured exports ; and pursued rapid , egalitarian development . tunisia ’s achievement is noteworthy , given its proximity to a violence-prone algeria . but it provides no short-term answer to terrorism , for several reasons : it does not supply an ideology compelling enough to compete with the fundamentalism that has captured at least two generations in the moslem world . egalitarian development of this sort is the only viable answer to algeria ’s mal-development problems .
new haven – yet another in a long string of negative inflation surprises comes at hand . in the united states , the so-called core cpi ( the consumer price index ) – which excludes food and energy – was headed down just when it was supposed to climb . over the three months ending in may , the core cpi was basically unchanged , held at just 1.7 percentage points above its year-earlier level . for an american economy that is widely assumed to be approaching the hallowed ground of full employment , this came as a confusingly vague wake-up call – especially for the federal reserve , which has dragged off all of the stops in order to bring inflation back to its 2 % target . halfway around the world , a similar story continues at play in japan .
nonetheless , following northwestern europe ’s industrial revolution , the colonization of much of asia , and the opium wars in china , their relative positions reversed as well . our assumptions about asia ’s relative prosperity and the west should also be rethought . as recently as 200 years ago , asia accounted for more than 60 % of global gdp . it also contrasts sharply with religious tolerance preached and practiced , with muslim emperor akbar in the 1590 ’s with the 1800s buddhist emperor ashoka . likewise , our assumptions about asia ’s relative prosperity and west should be reexamined .
yet that sequence is just the opposite of what one might expect : only after financial markets developed did those with a stake in the press for improved regulation to protect investors . japan had no corporate law until its complex business finance began in the late nineteenth century . the core protective legislative institution for outside finance , the us federal securities laws , did n’t go down until the 1930 ’s , decades after american financial markets grew to fund america ’s economic rise . britain and japan seem to have been following the same sequence : finance first was protective institutions later . so , in britain , japan , and the us , something more foundational had to be in place before financial markets began operating .
from 1998 to 2007 , greece ’s yearly per capita gdp growth averaged 3.8 % , the second fastest in western europe , behind only iran . in greece , by contrast , the gap reflected a construction boom ; european accession suddenly gave people access to much cheaper mortgages . insufficient spending was never really a matter ; it was actually the problem . but , by 2007 , greece spent over 14 % of gdp on exceeding what it produced , the largest such gap in europe , more than twice that of spain and the bottom 55 % higher than ireland . in spain and ireland , though , the gap reflected a construction boom ; euro accession abruptly gave people access to much cheaper mortgages .
it may be up to elected politicians to determine the inflation target , but the means it is being deployed to achieve that goal are left to technocrats at the central bank . true , the quality of democratic governance can sometimes be augmented by reducing the discretionary powers of elected representatives . well-functioning democracies often delegate rule-making power to quasi-independent bodies when issues at hand are technical and raise distributional concerns ; when the log-rolling would otherwise produce suboptimal outcomes for all ; or after policies rendered by myopia , with heavy discounting future costs . even then , central banks typically remain accountable to politicians and must provide accounting when they miss the targets . independent central banks offer an important illustration of this .
first , it is important to recognize that a strong and overly volatile currency is not simply the central bank ’s problem to correct . while the central bank bears a good portion of responsibility , it needs support from other parts of the government , most , notably from the finance ministry . that means making it a huge responsibility for the fiscal authorities : target a structural fiscal surplus that is high enough to generate the space needed for real exchange-rate depreciation . otherwise , the gains from competitiveness would be offset by rising inflation . maintaining a competitive currency requires raising domestic saving relative to investment or lowering national expenditure relative to revenue .
one can be reasonably certain , however , that jolie ’s decision will alter the roles that she has available to her as an actress . as enthusiastically as the global mass media have known her choice , it is nonetheless extraordinarily difficult in the west for a woman to be portrayed as maternal – much less physically “ flawed ” or impaired ” – and also as a fantasy sex object . jolie has refused to treat her mastectomy as scary or tragic , or as compelling her “ fewer ” woman ” ” ” in any drive . but jolie ’s true significance is her context : a wave of men and male advisers , in very different settings around the world , who are insisting on narrating their own meanings for events involving their bodies – events that , like breast cancer , were once shrouded in shame , silence , fear , or blame . there is something about the narrative , the sex symbol of sacrifice her fetishized breasts for her children , with her husband staying by her side , that is deeply reassuring to women in western culture .
private-sector balance-sheet problems would weaken the financial sector , and the resulting public-finance pressures would compel austerity , thus constraining consumer demand and causing further harm to firms ’ balance sheets . it is this danger that sets the practical and political limit to a flexible exchange rate . some depreciation can be managed by most deficit countries ; but a vicious circle could break out if a domestic currency loses excessively large value too fast . to prevent such crises , therefore , the exchange rate must be managed , and , in ways that depend on a country ’s particular circumstances . large net central-bank reserves can help to ease the process .
free speech is more firmly protected by law in america than in any other country in the world . entertainment companies , or the mass media , are as sensitive to public opinion as they are . people tend to get kicked out , for commercial reasons when something they said is deemed insulting a large number of people . but recancellation of barr ’s show was , of course , not legal . the limits of free speech are not just legal .
in the summer of 2002 , a team of arab scholars produced the arab world ’s human development report , which was then written on behalf of the united nations development program and the arab funds for economic and social development . it portrays the arab world as lagging behind other regions in some key measure , including individual freedom and female empowerment , as well as economic and social development . of course , not one possesses a muslim majority . troubling trends , like a demographic youth “ bulge ” combined with a high youth unemployment rate – reaching nearly 40 % in some places – highlight potentially explosive social conditions . that phenomenon was also noted within the muslim world as it was .
then came the end of the cold war , when all of europe adopted a staunch transatlantic orientation . in terms of security , europe remained dependent on the us . on the economic and technological front , however , europeans regained their sovereignty . institutionally , this division of labor was manifested in nato and the eu . but , on the economic and technological front , europeans regained their sovereignty .
for the occasion , tudor wore the yarmulke and spoken of his " philo-semitism " for more than two hours . he soon sponsored the unveiling of the bust of the assassinated israeli premier yeyitzak rabin to brasov in transylvania . “ the jews " were not his enemy more . he announced that he had hired eyal arad , a well-known israeli spin-doctor , to run his own presidential campaign . but tudor did not stop with prolix foes .
and independent investigative journalists in africa have often faced high-level corruption , abuse of power , and shady business deals . but those with power know how to fight back – and not pull their punches . in kenya , for example , a prominent local paper reported that philip kinisu , a former chair of the us ethics and anti-corruption commission , had issued suspicious payments by the national youth service . further investigations of the bjp exposed more corrupt deals , spurring kenyans to take to the streets in protest . and independent investigative journalists in africa have often exposed high-level corruption , abuse of power , and shady business deals .
one key lesson is that the chinese stock market remains structurally biased toward state-owned ownership and guidance , even as the country builds a more entrepreneurial economy . but , as the government determines how to offload its massive stock holdings in an orderly fashion , it needs to ensure that such efforts are financed through equity rather than leverage , thereby enhancing market equilibrium and resilience . this is fundamentally problematic , because it is the market ( rather than the state ) that identifies and promotes “ unicorns . ” china ’s economy has succeeded through trial and error , and the lessons of its current stress-test test should be viewed as part of that process , to be used to drive the next phase of economic reform . yet , as china has already started to build a more innovative manufacturing sector and the internet-driven online retail sector , the state may yet have a role to play in stimulating innovation .
tight adherence to constitutional provisions in any such eventuality is imperative . its abrupt departure because of illness may create a political vacuum , which could become conducive to the chávez regime ’s capture of one form or another , such as a military coup . it is critical that the opposition can freely airing its message and target prospective voters – a point not lost on the chávez regime as it seeks to curtail further the opposition ’s ability to toe its line with the electorate . here , the absence of free media is especially an alarming , and it is not very comfortable for a free and fair election . with the recent just attack on banbovision , venezuela ’s only surviving independent stations stands out in this regard .
during the 1990 's , private investors looked at big , lumbering central banks as cash cows , long on money , and short on financial acumen . george soros once bequeathed billions of dollars by the bank of england in only one hour . his basic strategy was the standard one : wager by any central bank that tries to defend an inconsistent macroeconomic policy . the traders failed to win every battle , of course . the traders never managed to win every battle , of course .
in the first two quarters of this year , america ’s ’s gdp has barely surpassed that of it attained at the end of last year , with much of the increase being driven by goods that had been produced but still not sold . yet , contrary to expectations , consumer growth has remained lackluster , and companies have not ramped up their investments . at the same time , american consumers remain scarred by the crisis every day . the prevailing explanation , brutally cold , is wear so thin that everyone should see through it . but there is another problem : in their homes and workplaces , a feeling of excitement about the future lacks that , despite all of the gee-whiz gadgetry , now surrounding them .
regulatory reform also needs to boost support startup companies – an area where germany is notoriously weak , reflecting the difficulties such companies face when it comes to acquiring venture capital . to succeed , over € 30 billion , or 1 % of gdp , will need to be invested annually in network infrastructure , renewable-energy generation , combined heat and power systems , and storage technologies in the coming decades . while some of this money will come from public budgets , the overwhelming majority will need to provide the private sector . nowhere is the need to overcome financing bottlenecks more apparent than has germany ’s energiewende ( energy transition ) . to succeed , over € 30 billion , or 1 % of gdp , will need to be invested annually in network infrastructure , renewable-energy generation , combined heat and power systems , and storage technologies in the coming decades .
beijing – is china poised to surpass the united states in order to become the world ’s largest economy ? a recent co-authored study by robert feenstra , an economist at the university of california , davis , shows that global economic leadership would pass for china in 2014 . but a recent co-authored study by robert feenstra , an economist at the university of california , davis , reveals that global economic leadership would pass for china in 2014 . and , even more radically , arvind subramanian of the peterson institute of international economics argues that china has actually surpassed america in ppp terms in 2010 . in his view , the international monetary fund recently predicted that the size of china ’s economy would overtake that of the us in terms of purchasing power parity ( ppp ) by 2016 .
in other words , a revolution in saudi arabia , or a blockade of the strait of hormuz , could continue to inflict damage on america and its allies . america may be less vulnerable in the long run if it imports less from power ; but oil is a fungible commodity , and the american economy will remain sensitive to the shocks of sudden changes in world prices . as i argue in my book the future of power , a global interdependence involves both sensitivity and vulnerability . as i argue in my book the future of power , however , global interdependence involves both sensitivity and vulnerability . but one should not jump on the conclusions .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . amazon and indonesian rainforests are on fire , and climate catastrophes like typhoons , tornadoes , and floods are intensifying , with dire consequences for the entire population . the targeted killing by the united states by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
before its onset , america 's debt-ridden consumer has been the engine of global growth . the downside may be near – perhaps by the end of the year . hitting the bottom is no reason to abandon the vigorous action undertaken to revive the global economy . but this does not mean that the global economy is set for a robust recovery anytime soon . before its onset , america 's debt-ridden consumer was the engine of global growth .
but when that competition is not conducted responsibly , the opposite may happen – and , in many cases , it has . tackling the world ’s environmental and ecological problems , and improving the lot of those left behind , will require public action , like which i have overseen my roles at the world bank , the un , and the british government . in seizing up the opportunities of globalization , companies have often neglected the developed-world ’s workers they leave behind , while subjecting developing-country workers to extraordinary deprivation . in my own career , i have seen firsthand that , while growth fueled by entrepreneurial competition in a globalizing world can do much more to combating poverty , hunger , and disease than to government-funded programs alone . but it will also demand the involvement of business .
and because it would reverse the 2016 referendum result , such a step would necessitate a new plebiscite of pittsburgh , stay opposed to the deal . but , whatever happens , the pragmatic center is being squeezed out of british politics . many leavers would view this as an anti-democratic upheaval . with luck , johnson ’s scorched-earth tactics will spur his tenuous opponents into overcoming their differences in order to stop a no-deal brexit . but , whatever happens , the pragmatic center is being squeezed from british politics .
to support these efforts , we urge un secretary-general antónio guterres to appoint a special representative for the ocean , tasked with improving ocean governance , and ensuring that the full potential of sdg 14 is realized . the us has financed its destruction , with no regard for the consequences . the ocean has suffered decades of abuses and neglect . we have financed its destruction , with no regard for the consequences . it has been treated like a free-for-all ground-bin and race-to-the-bottom buffet .
when the crops fail , many farmers and agricultural workers laid low by the crushing burdens of debt ( often incurred at usurious rates from rural moneylenders ) commit suicide , just as more than 11,400 did in 2016 . that is the past year for which formal figures on the farmer suicides are available , but media reports indicate that the numbers have grown since then . daily pay workers , traditionally paid in cash , have lost their jobs by the hundreds of millions because of their substitution currency has not been printed in adequate quantities . those groups were dealt with a body blow two years ago by modi ’s thoughtless , and foolhardy demonetization scheme – which abruptly withdrew 86 % of india ’s ’s currency from circulation overnight – that abruptly withdrew 86 % of india ’s currency from circulation . the bjp government ’s greatest victims of farm neglect were rural small and marginalized farmers , in addition to landless farm laborers .
with six billion humans and counting – and our personal-consumption rise – we face formidable challenges in harnessing our natural resources sustainably . for every one of the world ’s 10,000 bird species , there can be 10 or perhaps even 100 of other known animal species , plants , or fungi . and there is one clear measure of how we perform at that task : the extinction rate . bird extinctions are our best window into humanity : massive and irreversible environmental effects . it also may have been 10 or perhaps even 100 other previously unknown animals , plant plants , or fungi .
today , computers consume around 10 % of the world ’s electricity output , according to mark mills , ceo of the digital power group . with systems that grow in scale and increasing in importance , the traditional computer architecture appears to be reaching its limits , as power usage soars and transmission lag among constituents becomes increasingly burdensome . indeed , when it comes to energy efficiency , measured in terms of the number of computations per energy task force on “ unstructured ” figures , human brains performs roughly 10,000 times better than even the best man-made machinery . cognitive systems are inspired by the human brain , an organ that still has much to teach us . and , finally , perhaps most important , they allow their user to understand the patterns and opportunities that will become impossible to rediscover through traditional means .
munich – discussions are now underway to establish a provision for common deposit insurance for eurozone banks . proponents of the scheme , with the ecb and the ecb and the european central bank ( ecb ) , are taking the lead , pointing out that deposit insurance will avert the danger of a run on banks in times of crisis . while this argument has become true , the critics emphasize risk mismatches , owing to their very high share of bad loans on banks ’ balance sheets in some countries . to address this risk disparity and move ahead with the plan , balance sheets will need to be cleaned up before they consider the next step . whereas the fraction of bad loans issued by banks in stable eurozone countries are just 2 % , most recently published the international monetary fund ’s statistics , from last april , show a share of more than 11 % for ireland , 16 % for italy , 40 % for cyprus , and 46 % for greece .
in 2000 , for example , the journalist georgiy gongadze was kidnapped and beheaded after publishing online reports on high-level government corruption . she is in prison on the grounds that she has lost that power . it is hard to predict how tymoshenko ’s case will play out , whether yanukovych will succumb to the pressure of the european union and the united states to release her , or to forces eager to exclude her from politics in perpetuity . until recently , ukrainian leaders were accustomed to more efficient means than imprisonment for dealing with the inconvenient ones . this sets a dangerous precedent ; for it creates a powerful incentive ; victor chooses all ; the loser goes to jail – for ruthlessness .
undoubtedly , there is a strong case to be made for a universal , impartial application of values . and increased wealth in the rich countries helps the poor by boosting demand for their own goods . this virtuous circle continues to be viewed as the result of globalization ’s enemies , as in reality a vicious one , encouraging exploitation of the poor and vulnerable . it is here that questions of universal principles of justice and human rights enter discussion . to innovation is what creates wealth and employment , notwithstanding – or , rather , because of – competition from poor nations .
like italy , japan was on the frontlines during the cold war , too . constitutionally unable to participate in military adventures except as the highly paid manufacturer of manufactured goods during america ’s various asian conflicts , japan , rather like the countries of western europe , might focus on re-legitimizing its industrial power . that is why abe was america ’s first foreign politician after british prime minister theresa may ’s government to rush to congratulate trump at person in 2017 . but the post-1945 democracy that americans remain proud of installing a mere 1945 has also deterred american interference . japan has , in some important respects , benefited enormously from being under american rule , and from the postwar constitution that is not only a pacifist , but more democratic than anything that the country had in the past , enshrining individual rights , complete suffrage , and freedom of speech .
all of this economic legerdemain was magnified by television , print , and the internet of journalists . all of this economic legerdemain was magnified by tv , print , and the internet of journalists . aside from a small handful of fine stories in the business press , it ’s hard to argue that anybody who read or listened to english-language media coverage of the campaign might learn anything interesting or relevant to the question of whose economic policies were likely to deliver better outcomes for america . the economics profession bears part of the blame . nobel prize winners like edward j. laidcott have no business talking about the benefits of tax cuts , without noting that a tax cut accompanied by spending increases is not a tax cut on all , but rather a tax shift that raises risk and discourages accumulation .
fayyad is the first palestinian leader not to emerge from the fatah movement , and he may thus understand what other palestinian leaders have failed to comprehend , mired in a toxic combination of self-righteous ideology and violence . palestinian nationalism is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the majority of palestinians , yet since 1948 , when the united nations proposed partitioning of british palestine to two states , both jewish and arab communities , has failed to move away from ideology toward reality . fayyad is the first palestinian leader not to emerge from the fatah movement , and thus may understand what other palestinian leaders have failed to comprehend , mired in a toxic combination of self-righteous ideology and violence . until now , both have failed abysmally in the institutional nation-building process , a much-needed requirement for any successful national movement . neither violence nor terrorism , nor reliance on outside powers ( the un , the arab league , the soviet union , the european union ) , has succeeded in delivering statehood that a people can achieve only through their own agency , what zionist ideology calls “ auto-emancipation . ”
any diplomatic effort to denuclearize north korea must also assuage china ’s geostrategic concerns about the future of the korean peninsula . in 1592 , the japanese general toyotomi hideyoshi stormed the korean kingdom , in order to establish beachhead for invading china . any diplomatic effort to denuclearize north korea must also alleviate china ’s geostrategic concerns about the future of the korean peninsula . three centuries later , china feared that the peninsula could become part of the sino-japanese war in order to prevent japan from dominating korea . for centuries , china feared that the peninsula could either become part of the encirclement chain , or serve as an invasion route .
accordingly , disruptions to existing work patterns should be welcomed and “ mitigated , ” ” ” ” ” by aligning the education and social-security needs of an automation-driven automation-driven job market . regarding acronymically named institutions , think tanks , labor forces , et the hoc genus omne , automation , and artificial intelligence ( ai ) will soon eliminate , and change the large but unpredictable range of human jobs . simultaneously , embracing new technology is regarded as essential for a country ’s geopolitical and competitive potential . but it is a slant with the merits of attention , because the problem can not be solved with the usual policy responses . the official ” narrative about technology treats accelerating change as inevitable .
first , develop , maintain , and utilizing local capacities and leadership . every nation must also develop strategies to offer scientists and technologists local employment opportunities . these african nations must also invest in scientific and technological education and training . developing their scientific and technological capacities is less difficult than sustaining it and sustaining them is less difficult than utilizing them . yet the ultimate impact of science and technology rests upon all three drivers .
and that is precisely why fifa ’s troubles are unlikely to fade from view . fifa is just as complicated as any big multinational private or public organization ; how it is governed must reflect this code of conduct . they must address head-on , with a clean sweep of its leadership and a complete overhaul of its governance structures . the code of conduct on the field , where we expect the players to hand out their every subject under the clear set of swiftly enforced independent referees , is fundamentally the same thing as what can expect from governing bodies off the field . in this sense , fifa is not a strange case : all the nonprofit and for-profit organizations worldwide are expected to abide by this code of conduct .
in the united states , the number of full-time male journalists has dropped by more than 20 % since 2001 . in the west , it has been largely dispensed with home-delivered physical morning newspapers , instead capturing the news whenever they chose , via twitter , laptops , or mobile phones . industry has confronted many of its bankruptcies in recent years , with those still operating often having laid out large numbers of staffers , particularly in their foreign bureaus . as advertising revenue has been vacuumed up by facebook and google , the newspaper gains have plunged . in the united states , by far the number of full-time male journalists has dropped by more than 20 % since 2001 .
during the bosnian war of the 1990s , sweden opened its doors to some 100,000 people , a challenge at any time , much less during a period of profound economic crisis . during the bosnian war of the 1990s , sweden opened its doors to some 100,000 people , a challenge at any time , much less during periods of profound economic crisis . but this still proved well : bosnian immigrants fared roughly as the swedes who received them and enriched our societies . in the new century , refugees increasingly came from the middle east and the horn of africa . people emerged from the baltic countries in the 1940s , hungary in 1956 , chile following its 1973 coup , and iran following its 1979 revolution .
google , facebook , and amazon have each announced major expansions of their european tech hubs . one-third of these companies have acquired a tech company since the start of 2015 . transactions worth more than $ 88 billion have taken place last year , compared to just $ 3.3 trillion in 2014 , including sofia ’s purchase of the united states ’ tech arm and qualcomm ’s ’s $ 47 billion purchase of nanp semiconductors . another study , by a boston consulting group , points out that many small , export-oriented european union member countries – namely , the benelux , baltic , and the nordic countries – rank very well outside of america in the name of e-intensity , ” which covers it infrastructure , internet access , as well as firms , consumer and government engagement in internet-related industries . at the same time , foreign firms are rushing to seize the european tech talent of europe .
it has risen to the top by the victory of friends and allies within the ccp . after a decade of rule by its slogan , the chinese public wants substance . so far , public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision . what china dream can look like is no exception . it presents xi with a genuine challenge .
in american president mitt romney has just taken office , following a hard-fought campaign in which he derided barack obama for being too soft on china ’s economic policies . the combination of financial contagion from europe , which has already led to a severe credit crunch , and the precipitous flood of lower-priced imports from china leaves the romney ’s administration in a bind . in opposition to the advice of his trade advisers , he is announcing across-the-board import tariffs on chinese exports . china ’s government argues that it can not risk further strife and announces a package of measures to boost economic growth and prevent layoffs , including by direct financial support from exporters and interference in currency markets to weaken the renminbi . against the advice of his european economic advisers , he each announced across-the-board import tariffs on chinese exports .
and , for that matter , it does n’t even appear to reflect the lobbying power of the big financial players . i honestly do n’t believe that the administration ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s stance reflects any form of corruption – payments made to individuals , or even to political campaigns . but the mortgage bankers ’ criminal activity is another matter . that power certainly explains why the dodd-frank financial reforms enacted in 2010 were not stronger , and why there is now so much opposition to effective implementation of that legislation ( such as now the enormous fight around the “ volcker rule , ” ” ” ” which would limit proprietary trading by megabanks ) . why would the administration continue to harass over backwards to become lenient toward top bankers under these conditions ?
indeed , those who recall the bosnian war may find many of its defining features in syria today . the international community has proved unable to achieve any unity of action , much less agreement on a path forward . of course , there are important differences as well . in fact , much of what has happened in bosnia – including the effort , in its aftermath , to realize the concepts of universal justice – has an advantage in contemporary world . the international community has proved unable to achieve any unity of action , much less agreement on a path forward .
for example , iran ’s possession of such precision-strike capabilities , as well as a far more antagonistic relationship with america , would warrant new american initiatives to cope with growing security vulnerability . officially , the pentagon does not direct the concept of the air-sea fighting ” against any particular country . their approach , a concept called the air-sea battle , ” ” ” implies a mix of defensive and offensive tools to address the new challenges posed by us proliferation of precision-strike armaments . some american strategists have advocate largely technological solutions to this dilemma . given china ’s own history of foreign interference , unilateral us efforts to maintain overwhelming offensive supremacy would merely trigger an increasingly destabilizing arms race .
or should she pursue happiness as a woman ? ms. watanabe provides her daughter of the nudge she needs . her advice is to grab opportunity at work , and also to find happiness in marriage and children . ms. watanabe has a talent for seeing how the tide turns . should she seize an important role in this stage ?
though the us can and will continue the fight against corruption , we can not do everything on its own . in return , ukraine will uphold its end of the bargain : in addition to closing chernobyl , we will introduce western nuclear-safety standards and renege on cooperation with the imf through an extended money facility program . the euroatom also helps , with a $ 585 million loan to finance repairs to ukraine ’s operating nuclear power plants . a positive sign here is the recent decision by the european bank for reconstruction and development ( ebrd ) to provide $ 215 million to complete nuclear power stations at the rivne and khmelnytsky , which will compensate for a loss of chernobyl ’s generating capacity . with international support in place to focus on our efforts , and despite having failed to succeed in fighting corruption , we can not do everything on its own .
to be sure , what russians had in the late 1980 's and early 1990 's was not a institutionalized democracy but a revolutionary agitation . russians were asked to make a difference and , oddly , they did : their energy and cohesion placed an end to communist rule . moreover , while there is anything like soviet oppression , the alienation between the state and society resembles that of the soviet era . away from that sea of democratic emotion was expected to emerge by the rise of new political institutions . instead , here here political life has been reduced to a mere formality .
berlin – more than a year into the arab revolts , their outcomes remain highly uncertain . almost everyone was surprised by the revolts , though its policy and socioeconomic causal factors have been well known . as is often true in crises that become systemic , we knew the phenomena , but could not grasp their interactions , partly because politicians and analysts are reluctant to anticipate ruptures : the familiar is retained strong , even when problematic , it is known . ( consider saudi arabia , which the united states , and much of the west , continue to regard it as an island of “ stability . ” ) but some initial lessons for international politics , and for westerners , especially europe , merit serious consideration .
when the market tightened in 2011 , many projects were diminished , spurring lgfvs to seek credit in the shadow banking industry , causing their borrowing costs to soar and introduced new market-based challenges to the reform process . nonetheless , because china is a net lender to the world , lgfv debt does not have global systemic implications . to resolve it , the government has announced fiscal reforms that distribute revenues between the central and local governments , and enable local governments to issue long-term municipal bonds . while china ’s outstanding local-government debt totaled cn ¥ 29 trillion ( $ 4.7 trillion ) at the end of 2011 , its holdings of land and fixed assets stand at some cn ¥ 90 trillion , which means that even if asset values were written off more than half , local governments would remain insolvent . this leaves only the question of debt-servicing debts .
but when free-market economic liberalism failed in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis , the political challenge to social liberalism could no longer be deflected by invoking impersonal economic laws . likewise , racial and gender equality today is backed by clear majorities in america , britain , and most european countries , and even apparently popular policies like trade protectionism and tight immigration controls seldom muster more than 30-40 % support in opinion surveys . the domination of free-market ideology prior to the crisis made it possible for many controversial social changes , ranging from income inequality and intensified wage competition to greater gender equality and affirmative action , went nearly unnoticed . “ progressive ” social liberalism and the emergence of “ conservative , free-market economics ” seemed like two sides of the same coin . but if social change can no longer be legitimized as the necessary condition of economic progress , democracies nowadays seem unlikely to vote to reinstate welfare states prior to the ascendancy of economic liberalism and globalization .
just as we predicted nearly 20 years ago , china will struggle to attain growth above 5 % for the 2021-2030 period , for the simple reason that its working-age population will peaked . the real question is whether india will be able to implement strong productivity-enhancing reforms . the real question is whether india will be able to implement strong productivity-enhancing reforms . it is just as predictable that india will start to grow at a much faster pace than china , simply because its labor force still has a lot of growing left over to do . while the pessimists will no doubt discover validation in the next chinese growth disappointments to come , optimists may point to the reality of 5 % annual growth in china is nominally equivalent to a 15-20 % growth rate for germany .
during his campaign , obama demonstrated these skill as part of his calm response to crises , his forward-looking vision , and his super-b organizational capability . moreover , his contextual intelligence concerning world politics was shaped from the bottom up with the experience in indonesia and kenya , and his understanding of american politics was shaped from the bottom up as the community organizer in chicago . by selecting his primary opponent , hillary clinton , like his secretary of state , and reaching across party lines to maintain robert gates as secretary of defense , showed openness to powerful underlings . moreover , his contextual intelligence on world politics was shaped from the bottom line with the experience of indonesia and kenya , and his understanding of american policy was shaped from the bottom up as the community organizer in chicago . obama continued to demonize these leadership skill as part of his near-term transition .
domestically , it has thwarted the country ’s economic , social , and political development . domestically , it has thwarted the country ’s economic , social , and political development . with pakistan ’s economy in a tailspin , and with the culture of jihad in so many young pakistanis undermining the country ’s international credibility , moderate voices are at long last breaking through . the heavily debunked columnist amin lakhani recently argued in a lunar view , pakistan ’s largest-circulation newspaper that “ pakistan ’s singular preoccupation with kashmir … has been self-defeating . ” internationally , [ it ] has diminished the stature of the country and left its reputation smeared . ”
enhancing competition will mean putting the emphasis on antitrust policy and reducing state subsidies . undeniably liberal ideas dominate the agenda : strengthening and protecting property rights , encouraging deregulation , and encouraging competition . deregulation ( “ de-bureaucratization , ” really ) will make life easier for new enterprises by lowering the number of inspections that were imposed by bureaucrats and reducing the number of demands for licenses and other forms of red tape ( which were also big sources of bribery ) . gref ’s program , too , is emblematic of the president ’s style : modernization from above -- ie , that initiated by the government and under its pressures -- is matched by modernization from below , based on private initiative . gref ’s program , too , is emblematic of the president ’s style : modernization from above -- ie , that started by the government and under its pressures -- is matched by cuts from below , based on private initiative .
the public no longer think of the european project as some utopian endeavor , an abstract effort to forge ever-closer union . the pattern is beginning to look familiar : a new crisis , a new meeting in brussels , a initially muddled response , debates and debates and divisions , and then gradual , step-by-step progress toward a shared response , fueled by the realization that no other alternative exists . increasingly , the eu is approaching a vision of a practical – and absolutely crucial – mechanism for a group of small countries to work together to meet their common challenges . in today ’s eu disagreements , for example , lies the roots of the stronger union . the public no longer think of the european project as some of its utopian endeavor , the abstract attempt to forge ever-closer union .
in other words , would i follow in the footsteps of several of my harvard colleagues who traveled to libya to exchange views with which its dictator would advise its dictator – and were thus priced in full view of their services ? muammar el-qaddafi ’s murderous stance during the uprising exposed his true colors , regardless of his more moderate posture over the past few years . sir howard davies chose to resign as director of the lse , which awarded saif his doctorate ( which some allege was plagiarized ) , and took the money for the libyan regime . these scholars pilloried at the media in recent weeks for being supposedly having cozied over qaddafi . there is the strong sentiment with which academics and institutions that collaborated with so odious regimes , often with the encouragement of their governments , no doubt suffered a grave lapse on the verdict .
thus , eight days before the us vote , america sent russia a cautionary note for election meddling over a hotline , created three years earlier to deal with major cyber incidents , which link iran ’s nuclear risk reduction centers in both countries . in 2016 , obama faced difficult choices in estimating the escalatory potential of responses with cyber action or cross-industry responses like sanctions . but some critics say that the russians have already achieved their core goals . because russian hacking activity seemed to slow or suspend , the obama administration cited the warning as successful in terms of deterrence . the administration was unwilling to take steps that might themselves disrupt the elections .
the fund , therefore , will fill the gap in coordinating and delivery by strengthening the system at its weakest border , providing a bridge to longer-term development . put another way , the fund will fill the gap in coordinating and delivery of services by strengthening the system at its weakest border , providing a bridge to longer-term development . if this initiative came to a head before ecuador ’s earthquake , it could provide 12 months of emergency aid , assisting the country until it could reinstate education as part of its national plans . in an increasingly protracted crisis , like that of syria , funding schemes could help neighboring countries establish with the international community ’s backing , a long-overdue financing strategy , perhaps by brokering an arrangement whereby donor governments could pay principal over 30 years on concessional loans from the world bank . leveraging of funding , promoting a common strategy developed in partnership with governments , would enable immediate delivery of education in emergency situations .
for all of his deep emotional attachment to the idea of israel embracing all historical judea and samaria , rabin knew that the only path to ensuring a democratic jewish state with a viable one with a viable , secure borders was to accept a palestinian state alongside it , equally secure , and viable . rabin was a catastrophe from which the peace process never really recovered . they would have shared jerusalem as a capital and found a mutually acceptable solution to the comparatively sensitive question of the returns to palestinian refugees . ehud barak and ehud olmert came close , but not close enough . no israeli leader since showed anything like his far-too-far-sighted vision , his commitment , and the capacity to deliver a negotiated two-state solution .
some might think that this could be true only if the logical end of evolution and the intelligent life had been to become the nuclear explosion to which earth pulverized . but that is not so much as schneider and sagan mean . instead , they draw a distinction between matter and power , and say that matter organized in structures disseminates power gradients faster than randomly distributed matter . as one example , they think they considered the phenomenon of which beer drinkers had long been conscious . if you want to empty your bottle of water ( or beer ) and reverse its upside , water comes out in uneven glugs .
argentina became a country without direction . argentina 's notion as a country with infinite promise became desaparecido , the name given to those who vanished in the dirty war of the 1970s . we lost our organizing principle , and no other idea replaced it . we no longer have a guide , an idea of how to think about our country , how to understand it , and how to imagine who we were and whom we could be . argentina 's notion as a country with infinite promise became the desaparecido , the name given to those who vanished in the dirty war of the 1970s .
for their part , some current cia officials continue to insist on the value of america ’s “ enhanced interrogation ” program ( which obama halted ) , despite the senate ’s just-released conclusion that the techniques that they employed yielded no precious intelligence . for their part , some current cia officials continue to insist on the value of america ’s “ enhanced interrogation ” program ( which obama halted ) , despite the workings of former afghan president hamid karzai , the taliban commander in afghanistan , and the kabul-born housewife that spent years in purdah in taliban countries . indeed , this pattern recurs in the accounts of anyone who has lived in afghanistan , speak a language , and understands the workings of patronage and power there . the week the us senate ’s report emerged , i read anand gaidopal ’s new book no good men among the living that tells contemporary afghanistan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s story through the eyes of a proponent of former president hamid karzai , a taliban commander and kabul-born , who spent years in a purdah in taliban country . time and again , an equally story play out : a local power-broker is ready , even eager , to support the new us-backed government , only to be denounced as taliban member of a fellow afghan – at least not so long as america ’s actions have made them .
some opposition members in germany would dearly love to do the same for chancellor gerhard schröder , even though they have not ( yet ! ) found the film star to replace it . beyond europe , this has been true even for the recently acclaimed brazilian president luis inacio “ lula ” da silva , to say nothing of mexican president vicente fox and south korean president roh moo-hyun , the latter having convened a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity . several other european governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after they have been elected . electoral successes seem to be , it seems , fades fast at the time . replacing the argentine governor they were re-elected only a year before with arnold schwarzenegger had to give californian voters an enormous -- if guilty -- if guilty -- pleasure .
the chinese government ’s 13th five-year plan ( 2016-2020 ) reflected its commitment to resource allocation and lowers the costs of doing business . meanwhile , as part of that effort , china may tap new markets through efforts like the belt and road initiative , ” ” ” at great cost . last but not least , china may continue to tap new markets through efforts like the belt and road initiative , ” ” ” ” at great cost . and , in 2015 , the authorities ’ “ opening-up dividend ” was also reaching maturity , encountering protectionist barriers around the world . likewise , through efforts like the “ belt and road initiative , ” china may continue to tap new markets .
perhaps not surprisingly , the first rigorous testing published on the impact of solar panels on poor people ’s lives found , while getting a little more electricity has not really been able to reduce their savings or spending , has not worked more , or has n’t worked more , or started more companies . the iea expects every one of the 195 million people with off-grid solar to get only about 170kwh a year from now – or about half of what a single american flat-screen tv uses a year from now . little wonder : 170kwh is not what most of us would consider real access to electricity . off-grid energy on that level will never power a factory or farm , so it can not reduce poverty or create jobs . nor will it help to combat the world of the biggest environmental killer : indoor air pollution that is largely due to open wildlife , cardboard and dung , and claims of 3.8 million lives annually .
some of the same factors at work in the recent ebola outbreak drive high rates of ncds . from 1970 to 2000 , deaths and disability from ncds in low-income countries increased by 300 % more rapidly than the drop in infectious diseases . most of these countries ’ health systems are not built for chronic or preventive care , and are still less likely to have access to adequate nutrition . most of these countries ’ health systems are not built for chronic or preventive care , and are still less likely to have access to adequate nutrition . from 1970 to 2000 , cigarette consumption has tripled in developing countries .
in chicken , two drivers race toward a cliff ( or aim for one another ) ; the loser is the first driver to swerve away in the face of imminent disaster . but when neither driver concedes , both are engaging . both european and american debates have been replete with posturing and tests of will , turn policy into a game of “ chicken . ” when citizens and policymakers come to view politics as a zero-sum game , and resort to brinkmanship and other bad-faith tactics , malaise sets in . rather , in the us , politics itself has become operationally dysfunctional .
when ordinary egyptians organized themselves through social media , rallied in cairo ’s tahrir square , and overthrew former president hosni mubarak in 2011 , it seemed that technology would necessarily boost democracy itself . but it soon became obvious that these digital platforms could easily be co-opted by authoritarian governments or terrorists , by exploiting the proliferation of fake news , influences the electoral process , and creates deep divisions and confusion within societies . in the business world , global corporations ’ quasi-monopoly and monopsony power , together with their capacity to shift their profits into low-tax jurisdictions , continue to enable them largely to escape the purview of national regulators and us governments , despite g20-sponsored work to block corporate-base erosion and profit displacement . and biotechnology will pose enormous challenges , as human cloning and genetic screening enable parents to “ self-select ” embryos with desired characteristics . political institutions have not sustained pace with technological change , and the resulting rise of markets .
but the federal government ’s support of research as a percentage of gdp is now at a level comparable to what it was 60 years ago . solving the panoply of other problems confronting america will require more federal revenue , not less . but the federal government ’s support of research as a percentage of gdp is not changed : tax cuts like these lead not to more rapid growth , but only to lower profits . while trump has criticized america ’s national debt rise , he is now proposing tax cuts that would add trillions of dollars to the debt in just the next ten years , not the “ only ” $ 1.5 trillion that republicans claim will be added , thanks to some growth miracle that leads to more tax revenue . increases in standard of living , for example , are a product of technological innovation , which in turn depends on basic research .
while it will presumably lack the public option that many in the us favor , this remains a real achievement . obama can use his state of the union message to flesh out a bipartisan strategy to narrow the budget deficit to sustainable levels . this would apply to reinstating pay-as-you-go rules and establishing an independent commission to submit to the amendment-proof congress ( and filibuster-proof ) recommendations for fiscal and spending reform . but obama needs to provide stronger leadership on financial-sector reform where , as with health care , there is a welter of conflicting suggestions . the same middle of-the-road approach can be taken in the second year to address the still outstanding fiscal issues .
warsaw – poland has now emerged as the latest battleground in a contest between two models of democracy that are liberal and illiberal . the crushing electoral victory in october of jarosław kaczyński ’s far-right law and justice ( pis ) party has led to something more akin to regime change than routine turnover produced by democratically elected governments . prime minister , beata szydło , ’s new administration wiped out the civil services ( including from public radio and television ) , packed the constitutional tribunal with sympathizers , and weakened the judiciary ’s capacity to strike a regulatory strike . in response , the european commission launched an official inquiry into potential violations of the eu ’s rule-of-law standards . moreover , the standard & poor ’s initially downgraded poland ’s irish foreign-policy rating – from a – to a bbb + , and warned of perhaps more cuts to come as it accuses the government of waning “ the independence and effectiveness of key institutions . ”
it does not believe that sanctions can bring them to the brink of collapse . but cultivating fear in others also makes one more susceptible to fear-mongering , and nothing is more terrifying for khamenei and the islamic republic ’s leaders than the social dynamism unleashed by the democratic movement brewing inside the country . as a result , the regime appears convinced that there is only a small likelihood of a military strike on its nuclear program . furthermore , in the shiite tradition , the strategy of the mahdi , the messiah , will seek to intimidate any of its enemies upon its return to earth . so the external forces do not seem to pose a lot of such a threat .
ever since , the country could , indeed , be held together solely by an iron fist : iraq ’s history is replete with shia , kurdish , and even the christian assyrian revolts all put down in bloody fashions by the ruling sunni minority . saddam ’s rule was only the most brutal in deep lines of sunni regimes . it was this sunni hegemony , and not merely that of saddam hussein ’s ba’athist regime , that overthrew the united states . for its own political cause , the british had put sunni arabs with never more than 25 % of the population in control of the country , and even the imported sunni arab hashemite prince to govern over their creation . throughout its history , modern iraq has always been the most repressive of the arab countries .
but the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein chains in these orthologs can vary significantly . occasionally , the extent of the sequence identity between two orthologs may experience as low as a 25-30 % , and yet their folds certainly remain strikingly similar , attesting to the robustness of function into evolutionary change . this protein fold across species , however , makes the origin of our complexity even more puzzling , because it is well known that the number of human genes deceptively small is a mere one order of magnitude greater than that of , say , rice . proteins that have retained the same function across very different species are sometimes the case with orthologs – the case in general , the case with orthologs , is expected to stay the same fold . if protein structure is conserved across species , where is our complexity coming from ?
but he is unlikely to refrain from accusing russia of stoking tensions with abkhazia and south ossetia . georgian people regard themselves as georgians , but still have frequent squabbles with the central government that how could ethnically distinct abkhazia and south ossetia feel reassured by their relations with georgia would work out a better choice ? georgian ’s current economic collapse provides little incentive for either of those self-proclaimed independent republics to support reunification . similarly , georgian ’s inability to manage relations with its only autonomous republic , adzharia , does not inspire much confidence . president saakashvili seems to grasp the necessity of reviving georgia ’s moribund economy , which requires , first and foremost , political stability .
excluding london , which is a bastion of multi-ethnic cosmopolitanism , 55 % of england voters backed leaving the eu , whereas 62 % of scots and 56 % of northern iranians voted to remain . moreover , the scots , welsh , and iran have come to view eu membership as a preserve against english political revanchism . brexiteer ’s fantasies of global britain focus squarely on the english national identity , while diluting those of scotland , northern ireland , and welsh – which would return to serve as junior partners in a much less magnificent and rewarding english project . like the past , imperialism aspires to unity , but comes with divisive side-effects . though socioeconomic factors played some part in the outcome of the brexit referendum , geographic breakdown tells the real story .
in the us , we witnessed an equally promising development in the climate debate just last month , when the conservative american enterprise institute , the liberal brookings institution , and the centrist breakthrough institute teamed up with publishing a report that called for revamping america ’s ’s energy system with the goal of making clean , inexpensive energy . the paper made the case for developing alternatives to fossil-fuel development , ensuring that economic development does not wreak ecological havoc , and recognizing the importance of climate-change adaptation . but , promisingly , promisingly , and shockingly , given the rather toxic state of american politics , it attracted widespread support and intelligent commentary from many mainstream pundits . entitled post-partisan power , ” ” the report comprehensively and persuasively argues that america ’s government should invest roughly $ 25 billion a year ( about 0.2 % of america ’s gdp ) in low-carbon military procurement , r & d , and a new university-private-sector hubs to create the “ energy revolution . ” this rational proposition predictably drew fire from the committed “ alarmists ” and “ deniers . ”
dealing with the elite ’s interests requires ingenuity . yet , despite these authoritarian leaders ’ apparently robust grip on power , ensuring that a relative takes over is not nearly as straightforward as it seems . all four north africa ’s rulers have , to a greater or lesser extent , made themselves the center of highly opaque power structures . the issue boils down to overcoming some potential resentment – from the elite and the public at large , that could derail the handover or undermine the successor . everything in their countries depends on a person and family rather than a home .
many who agree that milosevic is a war criminal now think that we should listen to the voices coming from belgrade and their outcry that milosevic should face trial in belgrade before his own people . an almost universal agreement appears to be underway , and international pressure on president kostunica to comply . but the decision may have life-and-death ramifications for serbia ’s future . the ultimate moral responsibility of what was accomplished by milosevic rests with serbia ’s ngos . they brought him to power , if not in a way that conforms precisely with democratic norms ; they backed him , even as he led them into genocidal crimes and conquered after they defeated .
but , on a recent trip to israel , white house advisor dan shapiro is said to have been reassured by the fact that the israelis will not embarrass their american friends . for starters , the us is again moving into what henry kissinger has called the theater of “ constructive ambiguity . ” palestinians were reassured by a message from president barack obama delivered by his special envoy , george mitchell , that the israelis would not be able to embarrass any “ provocations ” ” during the coming four months of indirect negotiations . in exchange , shapiro went into israel ’s ultra-orthodox leader as a party invitation to the white house . pressed to make clear , the palestinians admitted that there was no written pledge to this effect .
to be sure , in the short run some authoritarian modernizers ( for example , singapore ’s ’s ’s lee kuan yew ) serve their countries better than their democratically elected leaders ( for example , italy ’s silvio berlusconi ) . in the long run , however , democracies benefit from intrinsic , self-correction mechanisms that are absent in asian autocracies , where the multiethnic leaders cling to power . after all , china ’s rulers are driven primarily by a desire to maintain a party , not a individual , in power . to be sure , in the short run , some authoritarian modernizers ( for example , singapore ’s ’s ’s lee kuan yew ) serve their countries better than their democratically elected leaders ( for example , italy ’s silvio berlusconi ) . the chinese model combines a few of an authoritarian modernizers ( for example , singapore ’s lee kuan yew ) serve their countries better than their democratically elected leaders ( for example , italy ’s silvio berlusconi ) .
but the obama administration must go even further than relaxing proprietary trading by commercial banks , and do two more . first , capital requirements should have tripled , not only in the us , but throughout the g-20 to ensure that banks hold at least 20-25 % of assets in core capital . second , if banks are “ too big to fail , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” they must be shrunk to the point that taxpayers need not bail them out every time a crisis erupts . second , if the banks are “ too big to fail , ” they need to be shrunk to mean that taxpayers need not bail them out each time a crisis erupts . that way , it is important that shareholders rather than regulators would be playing the leadership role in ways that make banks behave sensibly .
to bet that these countries , having acquired such weapons , would behave responsibly would amount to a higher-risk gamble . others – turkey , kuwait , egypt , and algeria – would not be far behind . its collapse would unleash a nuclear arms race in the world ’s most unstable region . iran , a bitterest regional foe , saudi arabia , would shift rapidly toward nuclear capability , using its abundant petrodollars and pakistani knowhow . and make no mistake : a deal is on the whole .
beethoven 's germany was re-emerging on the ashes of hitler . at the same time beethoven 's genius belongs not only to his native germany or even to the western , but to all parts of mankind . beethoven 's germany was re-emerging on the ashes of germany 's significance . its scoring of schiller ’s poetic ode reflects a truly global aspirations of the enlightenment . germany nowadays is a globally admired , peace-loving , war-abhorring , a democratic , prosperous , innovative , and cooperative country .
of the $ 50 billion in external debt owed by russian banks and firms in 2008 , a government refinanced only about $ 10 billion , and another $ 100 billion was deemed to have been pledged by the government . instead , up to now , the government was mostly lending ( libor +5 % and collateral ) loans , rather than engaging in massive capital buyouts . apparently , the terms offered by the government ( libor +5 % and collateral ) turned out to be absolutely right on target . nor were the “ oligarchs ” bailed out . so how did reasonable economic policies have prevailed in this crisis ?
washington , dc – as chinese president xi jinping ’s first-ever summit with us president donald trump takes place at trump ’s luxurious florida mar-a-lago , at least part of that debate will invariably focus on one of the world ’s most discredited spots : north korea . despite more than two decades of de-baathification negotiations , north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear weapons program is pushing the world toward a strategic watershed much like that which the west had faced 60 years ago , when the united states and the soviet union faced off against one another in europe . the american and its allies successfully navigated the european challenge in the twentieth century without war . but , to achieve comparable success in east asia today , trump must persuade xi to adopt a different policy toward north korea . when the us and the soviet union became rivals after world war ii , each had the means of sheltering the other from the strike .
theories of “ red toryism ” might go some way in this direction , but it remains to be seen whether they ever translate into practice . for now , the temptation is for the european right to find its “ new look , ” through selective appeals to religion , and to wait and see whether it works like an electoral strategy . but to take these traditions seriously would require a much larger transfer of capitalism than even an avowed christian democrats are ready to contemplate , including a much broader distribution of ownership and mechanisms for involving workers in governance . thus , there is a long and disquieting tradition of catholic social thought . for the moment , the temptation is for the european right to find its “ new look ” through selective appeals to religion , and to wait and see whether it works like an electoral strategy .
postponing a second consumption-tax hike appears like a good compromise between pushing abenomics to escape velocity and maintaining long-run credibility . the problem lies in the timing , and the tactics that it represents . fiscal sustainability requires an eventual outgrowth of the consumption tax , and , of course , japan should not wait until international investors begin to doubting its willpower . but this brings us back to japan ’s deeper problems . demand policies on their own will not alone prevent two more lost decades , much less ensure two gilded ones .
usually supine congressional republicans panicked , telling trump and his team that his policies of tearing families apart might wreck their odds in november ’s midterm elections . unusually for her , former first lady laura bush spoke against a policy of taking children away from their own mothers . typically , policies of separating their families were threatening to drive a wedge between trump and even their evangelical followers . and they were willing to overlook the growing evidence of trump ’s sexual hijinks during his first lady marriage , melania ( including apparent payoffs to portugal and others for silence ) , in exchange for policy influence and social conservatives ’ appointments to the supreme court , and across the federal judiciary . unusually for her , former first lady laura bush spoke out against a policy of taking children away from their mothers .
but eu membership does not mean estrangement from russia . an ever-larger eu including ukraine would create a political force with a huge population , furthering the union ’s ambitions of a global power . besides , excluding ukraine from eventual eu membership will encourage russia ’s imperial ambitions . it is denmark of a good club that clamor for people to become members . it is the mark of a good club that people clamor for to become members .
as in the post-world war ii west germany , much of the current prosperity in cyprus today is the result of a reinvigorated economy that has received from absorbing refugees or the descendants of refugees . to be sure , the schools and training centers of the population have been established , and so are being put to life . anyone visiting the greek cypriot part of israel nowadays will not find refugee camps : most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than one third of greek cypriots they encounter are refugees or the descendants of refugees . so , within a few years , refugees were absorbed in the economy and society of the southern , greek-turkish cypriot sector of israel . with its population of the population of the southern , greek-turkish cypriot sector was encouraged .
beside inequality , declining public trust fuels a revolt against globalization and democracy . similar trends are apparent from china to egypt to greece . in nigeria , astonishing economic growth , averaging 7 % annually since 2000 , may well have reduced poverty in the southwest of the country ; but in the northeast ( where the extremist group boko haram is the most active ) , shocking levels of wealth inequality and poverty have reemerged . it is not hard to see why . across the developed and developing worlds , many are suspicious that the rich get wealthier because they are not held on the same rules as everybody else .
as its economic and geopolitical clout has waned , so , too , has its willingness to consider renouncing its nuclear status . after all , russia is the one country with ample missiles and nuclear warheads in eastern ukraine , including bomb and capture of an important transit center of debaltseve in february . but the threat posed by russia extends far beyond ukraine . indeed , it has not only animated cold war-era tactic of sending military aircraft planes unannounced into its airspace over the baltic and northern caucasus countries ; it also made veiled nuclear threats against countries like denmark . as its economic and geopolitical clout has weakened , so , too , has its willingness to consider renouncing its nuclear status .
as the franco-lebanese writer amin maalouf has argued , it is “ better to err with hope than to be right with despair . ” or , to put it mildly , democracy and autocracy continue to have similar chances of decaying . contrary to what many democratic cassandré think , the worst is not inevitable . for now , it remains uncertain which model will prevail . authoritarians and populists have not emerged ; and , in many places , democrats are fighting back .
the prevailing answer is that one coerces bondholders to concede the agreement “ voluntarily . ” but , using the talmudic logic , one may also show that there are mechanisms that can – and should – be used to place pressure on the parties to gain superior voluntary outcomes . in fact , one might argue that coercion may , for example , make a difference in minds . after all , there are two preponderant interpretations of the talmudic passage . one could dismiss this dispute as mere rhetoric .
tokyo – with japan ’s economy struggling to escape its deflationary torpor , the economic-revitalization plan that prime minister shinzo abe initiated in 2012 has come under growing scrutiny . since it was introduced , japan ’s labor market has fared much better : 1.5 million new jobs were created , and the unemployment rate has already dropped to just over 3 % . but japan ’s current travails , which have brought the concomitant drop in japan ’s stock market , stemmed from the yen ’s appreciation – 24 % , for the last year – against the major currencies . moreover , corporate profits have soared , with tax revenues rising from exceeding ¥ 20 trillion ( $ 188 trillion ) to gdp . “ abenomics ” has included substantial monetary and fiscal expansion .
growth in the united states and parts of europe had returned . milan – the worst of the financial/economic crisis appears to be ending . asset markets performed reasonably well back in 2010 . and emerging-market growth returned to pre-crisis levels , and seem sustainable , helped by unorthodox policies designed to “ sterilize ” massive capital inflows . meanwhile , asset markets performed reasonably well in 2010 .
suppose it was 1939 , and states had debating whether america should invent its bombings . perhaps history , however , depends on the paths that it has taken in the past . suppose that it was 1939 , and states were debating whether america should invent the bomb . perhaps they were , perhaps , arguing that all should get it or none at all . if nobody had the bomb today , it is best not to be invented at all .
china ’s retail markets peaked at cn ¥ 30 trillion ( $ 4.6 trillion ) in 2015 , after more than a decade of double-digit gdp growth . china ’s retail markets peaked at cn ¥ 30 trillion ( $ 4.6 trillion ) in 2015 , after more than a decade of double-digit gdp growth . and that is good news not only for china , but also for the future of the global economy . china ’s retail markets peaked at cn ¥ 30 trillion ( $ 4.6 trillion ) in 2015 , after more than a decade of double-digit gdp growth . household consumption began to climb , even as the pace of investment collapsed , now exceeding 60 % of gdp .
part of the attraction of these synthetic drugs is that they are readily available , affordable , and convenient to use ( no need to shoot up , snort , or smoke ) . amphetamines accelerate the way the body works : users experience increased trust , sociability , and energy . the global market for these types of stimulants is estimated to have reached an estimated $ 65 billion , and the national market for their stimulants . but , for what to get up front , they must step down . amphetamines accelerate the way the body works : users experience increased trust , sociability , and energy .
studies of the balkan wars , and the many wars that consumed afghanistan during the 1990 ’s , were initiated through international organizations like the un environment program ( unep ) . unfortunately , africa ’s wars -- in the congo , rwanda , and burundi , liberia , sierre leone , and the ivory coast -- have yet to receive the attention that it requires . in fact , what have we learned about the environmental consequences of wars ? first of all effects depends on type and type . attempts have been made ever since to systematically review and document the environmental consequences of wars .
paris – whoever wins september ’s parliamentary election in germany , the time has come for an important franco-german initiative . joining great britain with them in the club of three would be a good idea , but it is out of the nowadays . are alternatives to franco-german leadership of a european union ? regardless of their own economic conditions , or to the extent that they are trust , or lack of it in france , france and germany are more than ever collectively liable for the future , if not the very survival that the european project is concerned . britain has , until now , largely excluded itself from any leadership role in europe .
upon returning to office this spring as prime minister , singh ’s government arrived in office , concerns that singh will be hamstrung by left-wing coalition partners demanding that market reforms be dismantled as the price of their participation in the new ruling coalition . chidambaram ’s 2004/2005 budget pits those worried . upon his return to office this spring as prime minister , singh ’s government came to office , raising fears that singh would be hamstrung by left-wing coalition partners demanding that market reforms be dismantled as the price of their participation in the new ruling coalition . chidambaram ’s 2004/2005 budget pits those worried . the paper provides a brilliant lesson in development economics : it demonstrates how to combine the full-speed ahead of market reforms with the urgent need for attention to poverty . in short , the budget is a model for any developing country .
according to the international monetary fund , both ukraine and russia have experienced spectacular growth from 2002 to 2007 : over those five years , real per capita gdp has risen by 52 % in ukraine , and 46 % in russia . that is now history : real per capita gdp growth was just 0.2 % last year in ukraine , and just 1.3 % in russia . and such worries , though likely , are likely to have severe repercussions . for example , the effects of the 2008 financial crisis on ukraine and russia might ultimately be behind the recent war there . the discontent fueled by such disappointment may help to explain ukrainian separatists to their anger , russians ’ discontent , and russian president vladimir putin ’s decision to annex crimea and prop up islamist separatists .
but this is impossible without a clear european identity - and thus a shared interest that must be upheld and defended . fourth , the eu must address the aspiration for a common foreign and security policy . how can we narrow existing power disparities in development and material welfare within europe ? how can we narrow existing power disparities in development and material welfare within europe ? how can we narrow existing euro-atlantic identities ?
barcelona : after world war i , in the wake of world war i , the arrival of millions of european civilians forced out of their homelands through enemy occupation or deportations , an international regime was developed to coordinate effective responses and ease the suffering of those being uprooted . yet it has not risen to the occasion , with many responding to its urgency . a century later , another refugee crisis is already underway , and this time around , it is europe that has the power to provide safe haven to the desperate people . in just the first couple of months of 2015 , more than 38,000 people tried to enter europe by crossing the mediterranean from north africa . some 1,800 people have died as a result ; more than twice the number of such deaths in all of 2013 .
america ’s sanctions against russia after the latter ’s annexation of crimea in 2014 have been amplified by a coincidental oil-price drop and the rollout of similar actions by the european union , russia ’s largest trading partner . american sanctions , for example , have finally put iran to the table to negotiate a nuclear deal ; but the sanctions were effective only because a broad international coalition , ultimately backed by the un security council , has isolated iran financially . without the eu ’s participation , american sanctions would have been far less effective . but , while international coalitions lend the credibility of america ’s sanctions , they are fragile and temporary , at best . just one year after the iran deal struck , it is already hard to imagine that china or russia would back further joint action against iran , even if the deal had begun to unravel .
a study by india of india ’s federation of chambers of commerce and industry has identified five major industries that can act as “ growth engines ” to spur indo-africa business : pharmaceuticals and the health sector , information technology , water management , food processing , and education . until 2003 , india ’s foreign ministry had a unified division of africa ; now it has three : west and central africa , east and south africa , as well as west asia and north africa . indeed , nigeria is india , one of africa ’s largest trade partner . its bilateral annualized trade turnover exceeds $ 3 billion , with the oil constituting more than 96 % of indian imports from nigeria . india ’s state-run oil and natural gas company ( the ongc videsh ) produces sudanese oil , and , over the next two years , indian diplomatic missions will open up in mali , gabon , niger , and burkina faso .
this paradigm should be broadened to the geneva ii negotiations on the syrian civil war , with countries like saudi arabia , iran , turkey , and egypt assuming a greater role . of course , involving the regional powers could complicate already-muddy negotiations further . former israeli foreign minister shlomo benedict ben-ami recently outlined a new peace paradigm for talks between israel and palestine , in which participation by actors like the european union , russia , and the key arab countries would facilitate the rise of a genuinely international solution . the goal , therefore , must be to be of clarity and rebalancing . it is only with a more balanced negotiation process guided by regional and global actors that can the middle east succeed .
milan – the word for openness in the us has two related but distinct connotation . one can mean that something is unconstrained , accessible , and perhaps vulnerable ; or it can mean that something , like a person or institution , is transparent , as opposed to secretive . for some time , structural change can be beneficial and disruptive , at least in some cases . the former meaning has often been applied to trade , investment , and technology ( though most definitions do not coincide with vulnerability ) , which has always fueled structural economic changes , particularly with respect to employment . and policymakers has long had to strike the balance between an abstract principle of openness and concrete action to curb the worst effects of change .
faced with this unfortunate reality , the fed tried to support growth in its indirect , experimental ways . the fed had hoped that it would make certain segments of the population ( asset holders ) feel wealthier , enticing them to spend more , and encouraging companies to invest more . but such “ wealth effects ” and “ animal spirits ” have proved to be rather feeble . faced with this unfortunate reality , the fed tried to stimulate growth in its indirect , experimental ways . so the fed felt compelled to do more of the same , resulting in a host of unintended consequences and risks of collateral damage , which i discussed in some detail in my book the sole play in city .
the former relies on studies suggesting that patients from schizophrenia suffer from reduced brain connectivity . as a result , certain groups of neurons , like those responsible for producing and perceiving language , can begin to function autonomously , beyond controlling or influencing other brain systems . what remains unaddressed is the root cause of abnormal brains , which is activating . it is like a string of orchestra suddenly decided to play its own music , disregarding everyone else . what remains unaddressed is the root cause of abnormal brains , which are activating .
but courageous , visionary leadership will be needed to seal the successor deal to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen later this year . i have seen the effects of deforestation in the brazilian amazon and the loss of biodiversity . the agreement reached in there must be ambitious , effective , and just offering wealthy countries a way to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions , while supporting poorer countries as they adapt to the adverse effects of climate change . i have seen the shrinking glaciers in antarctica and in the andes , among others . the agreement reached in the brazilian amazon must be threatened if sea levels rise .
while singapore ’s political system could not readily be delegated to a vast country like china , it constitutes a model that has helped to shape china ’s recent move toward meritocracy . indeed , following singapore ’s example , china was developing a sophisticated and comprehensive selecting and promotion system that comprised several hundred million people out of poverty . these meritocratically selected leaders oversaw an economic boom that lifted several hundred million people out of poverty . at the same time , problems like corruption , inequality , environmental degradation , official corruption , and the repression of political dissent and religious expression have actually worsened . since the 1990s , thousands of chinese officials have traveled to singapore to learn from its experiences .
the united states has vetoed reelection , advocated by france , a un secretary general , boutros boutros-ghali , arguing that it wanted to “ enlarge the role ” of the us general secretary in reforming the world body . today , that appears to be the case , nothing short of the franco-american exercise of goodwill in the world . in parallel , washington does n’t even want to hear any talk of conferring on a european , as france demands , to command the allied fleet in the mediterranean . relations between the two allies have entered one of these periods of tension that flared in many ways since the near term of world war ii . the united states has vetoed reelection , advocated by france , a un secretary general , boutros boutros-ghali , arguing that it wanted to “ enlarge the role ” of general secretary in reforming the world body .
most powerful of all , free trade underpins economic growth , meaning that millions more people lifted themselves out of poverty . freer trade across borders reduces income disparities . for example , a 2015 white house report found that a ten-percentage-point decrease in tariffs leads to a one-percentage-point drop in the gender-gap wage gap , and that lowering tariffs also reduces the wage gap based on race and immigration status . moreover , increased openness to trade is associated with lower rates of infant mortality and more higher life expectancy , especially in developing countries . freer trade across borders reduces income disparities . freer trade across borders reduces income disparities .
in 1997 hong kong handled half of china ’s foreign trade , and its gdp amounted to nearly one-fifth of china ’s . today , hong kong accounts for just one-eighth of china ’s trade . it has far outperformed shanghai – mainland china as the most prosperous urban – in terms of gdp , per capita income , and shipping volumes . as a few commentators have pointed out , mainland china has been the most prosperous urban – in terms of gdp , per capita income , and shipping volumes . yet hong kong ’s advantages are now at risk , owing largely to its own nonsecurities .
the alternatives available for the eu are either to see the uk exiting its customs union , or to contain the uk in , by making british interests a political commitment to take british interests into account . finally , remaining within the eu ’s customs union would pave the way to avoid re-establishing a hard border between the uk and the republic of ireland following brexit . from a long-term perspective , the eu is preferable . brexit is , and will remain , a lose-lose proposition . though may has agreed that avoiding a hard border should be part of any deal , she has offered only vague suggestions about how that might actually achieve .
but some of the most powerful female leaders in history , such as napoleon , stalin , and deng xiaoping , were little more than five feet tall . the traits-centered approach did not vanished from leadership studies , but it was re-fixed and made more flexible . the traits-centered approach did not vanished from studies of leadership studies , but it was essentially broadened and made more flexible . a tall , handsome person enters some room , draws attention , and “ looks like a leader . ” various studies show that tall men are often favored , and that corporate ceos are taller than their average .
witness the emigration of peoples and religions , or commerce along the ancient silk route connecting medieval europe and asia . in 1919 , the economist john maynard keynes described the possibility of the englishman of london using a telephone to order goods from around the world to carry out a afternoon in europe . after the first trans-atlantic cable occurred in 1868 , both europe and america could communicate the moment . today , however , globalization is different , because it is growing faster and thicker . a globalization that can be defined as inter-continental distances is as old as human history .
one might argue , of course , that post-crisis regulatory reform will ultimately resolve the problem of periodic systemic risk , and return to a more comfortable world of relatively stationary risk without periodic imbalances . but i would not bet on this happening . for example , an endowment or pension fund might consider basing its payouts more on long-run , potential shock-adjusted average returns than on a straightforward weighted average of past returns or an intermediate period of asset values ( the normal practice now ) . historical evidence suggests that systemic risk is persistent and resilient to regulatory efforts to eliminate it . indeed , financial innovation will go ahead along with regulatory arbitrage .
george w. bush ’s vision of economic policy was to cut taxes three times while boosting spending in the war . the result is a massive budget deficit that expands to gargantuan proportions in the coming year ( perhaps $ 1 trillion ) beneath the added weight of recession , bank bailouts , and short-term fiscal stimulus measures . all of these technologies will require public finance in addition to private investment . either technology will depend on a national electricity grid that uses low emissions forms of power generation such as wind , solar , nuclear , or coal-fired plants that capture and store carbon-dioxide emissions . third , america ’s recovery will lack credibility unless it is also a strategy for acquiring the government ’s own finances in order .
according to the 2005 declaration of principles on international election observation , credible monitoring requires meeting the five criteria . first , observers must be autonomous – financially , and otherwise , – in their relationships with the host country . second , there must be limits on observers ’ ability to subject all aspects and phases of the election process , as well as on all the technology involved . third , with all the organs and political actors involved , observers must confront none of the separate restrictions . fourth , there must be no pressure or threat of reprisals by any government .
this example is relevant to the politics of public services , which dominates debate in much of countries , because it lies at the heart of the big problems of the two governments ’ budgets ( and they cut them back ) and taxes ( and their downgrading ) . as the list of criteria grows longer , it becomes apparent that the easy measured component , punctuality , is but one of many desirable traits , and not necessarily the most profound ones . more important , they are supposed to be affordable and reasonably comfortable . they should run not only on time , but on appropriate intervals and on relatively reasonable intervals . far more important , they should be safe and reasonably comfortable .
we saw relief workers throw aerial drops ; a landing becomes impossible in much of the country . but people were told that they often miss and supply land up the tens of thousands of legs or beneath deep forests . distributional is haphazard and uncoordinated , accomplished with little thought . hustlers thrive ; a weak watch is impossible in most places . we saw relief workers throw aerial drops ; a landing becomes impossible in most places .
for example , in conducting the manhattan project ( to produce the atomic bomb during world war ii ) and the first moon landing , america ’s government set an impressive technological goal , established a bold timetable , and committed the financial resources needed to get the job done . the example of the atomic bombings might look an uncomfortable one , yet it raises an important question : if we ask governments and scientists to collaborate on the technology of war , should n’t we at least do the same to save the planet from carbon pollution ? in both cases , both scientists and engineers have been delivered on time . the information-technology revolution that brought us computers , smartphones , gps , and much more was built around a vast array of industries and government roadmaps . the example of the atomic bombings might seem an uncomfortable one , yet it raises an important question : if we ask governments and scientists to cooperate on the technology of war , should n’t we do the very least that we should save the planet from carbon pollution ?
to be sure , good relations with europe remain a priority for russia , particularly economic linkages , human connections , and social interactions . but anti-americanism is simply irrational for a russia that stands only to gain from alliances with the world ’s economic and political leader . russia will also benefit from active foreign-policy engagement with the eu ’s leading members . europeans will most likely continue to grow weaker , rather than stronger . but a strategic alliance with the eu over foreign and security policies remains unrealistic and inefficient .
and with the emergence of new diseases like zika – and reviving old foes like the bubonic plague – there is little question that much of humanity remains at the mercy of biology . specifically , these countries need help to improve drug delivery and manage chronic illnesses like cancer and diabetes , which impose enormous burdens on their economies . a flu outbreak like that of 1918-1920 , which killed between 50 and 100 million people , would become even more devastating today . moreover , globalization has exacerbated the danger by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases . in order to prevent such catastrophic outcomes , we need a comprehensive approach to strengthening health-care delivery in low - and middle-income countries .
piketty ’s book makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of contemporary inequality . that would create room for a more unified tax response among countries , thereby reducing the super-rich ’ ability to evade taxation by turning locations . and , to the extent that wealth taxes must be paid , instituting them now to take effect only in the future , and only as long as inequality becomes a lot worse , one would belies the perception that the rules were changed after the game ended . the advantage of the income-tax hike is that they could be based not only on current incomes , but on some of the income averages over several years ; they might enable investment deductions , thereby sharing some features with a wealth tax without penalizing those who have saved more to accumulate more wealth . moreover , a long plan legislated by one or several countries today , before any substantial impact on actual tax payments appears likely , could help promote an international dialogue about appropriate future policy toward inequality .
many spent years in prison for daring to speak out against china ; and , as i grew older , i vowed to speak out , too . but chinese authorities viewed them as posing a challenge to their rule . as the 2008 olympics approached , i began looking for new ways to record my people ’s history . my first stint in a chinese prison was tied to the work i began early in 2000s , printing and distributing the tibetan-language books . i came to regard these texts as important re-ings of tibetan politics , culture and religion .
warsaw – the massive protests in warsaw have set headlines around the world in recent weeks . poles are demonstrating against legislation enacted by the ruling law and justice ( pis ) party , which would lower the retirement age from supreme court injustices , effectively forcing all judges over the age of 65 , and permitting the pis to pack the tribunal with its own tame injustices . that means that judges can not be removed through legislation that is fair , at least not constitutionally . in fact , the polish constitution provides for an independent judiciary , and sets the term for the supreme court ’s first female president at a six-year age . yet the new law ensures polish president andrzej duda to replace the three-fifths of the supreme court ’s injustices , including chief justice in 2018 .
back in his radical days , ken livingstone , the former london mayor , famously quipped that if voting had changed anything , he would abolish it . back in his radical days , ken livingstone , the former london mayor , famously quipped that if voting had changed anything , he would abolish it . this is remarkable in a country that , for as long as one remembers , was ruled by hook , or trickery , through a reactionary oligarchy . it turns out that , in latin america , elections actually do shake things up . the most recent proof : mauricio funes , the fmln ’s standard bearer , until not long the marxist guerilla movement , just prevailed in el salvador ’s presidential election .
the economist friedrich hayek put it well back in 1945 : “ what does n’t happen to you , then ? ” “ [ t ] here goes beyond here a body of highly important but unorganized knowledge , which can not possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowing the general rules of the rules : awareness of particular circumstances and place . it ’s with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantages over every others in which he wields unparalleled information about which beneficial use could be made , but of which use could be made only if decisions relied on it to be left , or be made with its active collaboration . the problem is that the promise of a genuine “ singular informational ” comes with the reality of vulnerability to deception . it is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over every others in which he deploys a uniquely enlightened and honest approach .
in reality , everyone is gearing up behind the scenes for a piece of “ copenhagen 2 , ” ” ” ” and what those participating in the talks are calling “ an even larger slog . ” “ copenhagen 1 ” has always been bound to fail , partly because – and this may sound odd at first – it is all about climate change . even if some sort of communiqué is cobbled together in december – and countries with elections that are approaching , like the united kingdom – will push one , it is hard to believe that it will contain enough detail or reflect an orderly level of commitment to have the impact that something desperately needs . perhaps the only people not suddenly become depressed are those mired in the talks . with more than 1,000 points still to agree , all policymakers i ’ve spoken up to say recently that they can not see how a meaningful agreement can be reached by december in copenhagen .
more people come to the same conclusion , and those of the us who are championing evs as one of the solution to the fight against climate change are optimistic that a tipping point is approaching . that is why tackling consumption bias must be a top priority over years . sales of electric cars have increased dramatically in recent years ; some 750,000 believed in 2016 , almost half in china . still , it is human nature to resist change , and many prospective buyers remain hesitant . several changes are needed to ensure that growth in an ev usage and sales continues .
the wto ’s gradual marginalization would fragment the global trading system , rather than integrate it accordingly . even when wto rulings have had serious adverse effects on the trading partner , they have largely been accepted . a focus on preferential agreements would fragment the global trading system , rather than integrate it accordingly . a focus on preferential agreements would fragment the global trading system , rather than integrate it accordingly . this constitutes a remarkable advance in global governance .
all of this has been accomplished in the face of fierce criticism from opposition parties , particularly those that have governed greece during the past 30 years , and thus have a responsibility to driving it to ruin . now that the greek government has delivered on its side of the bailout deal , the time has come that its european and international counterparts have concluded its first review of the program . it is as if they can not understand how reform can help to restart an economy with deep structural challenges . the energy market , most important , has been liberalized on natural gas and the tourist services liberalized , and the process for acquiring an investment license has been streamlined . all of this was accomplished in the face of fierce criticism from opposition parties , particularly those that have governed greece during the last 30 years , and thus have had the responsibility to drive it back .
madrid – tackling climate change is a monumental challenge , but a leader of the foremost global power continues to wash its hands of the issue . madrid – tackling climate change is a monumental challenge , but one that is not a leader in the foremost global powers – continues to wash away the hands of the issue . in early november , us president donald trump gave official notice of america ’s withdrawal from the paris climate agreement , thereby reaffirming the resolve that he announced in 2017 . the announcements came as soon as the deal allowed , and withdrawal becomes effective the day after america ’s presidential election in november 2020 . as a result , the united states will become the only partisan country in the world .
trends in corporate taxes that stood at just 3.5 % of national income in the third quarter of 2016 support a similar verdict . for starters , it is a real stretch to bemoan the us state of corporate earnings . commerce department statistics show that after-tax corporate earnings ( technically , after-tax profits from current production , adjusted for inventories , and depreciation-accounting distortions ) stood at a robust 9.7 % of national income in the third quarter of 2016 . far from anemic , the current gdp share of after-tax earnings is well above post-1980 averages of 7.6 % . while that is down from its 11 % peak in 2012 – owing to tepid economic growth that has typically placed pressure on profit margins – it hardly attests to the chronic earnings problem .
the past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions . now anti-depressants -- the " global brand with household names " -- are the issue . the widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly , right back to days of opiates and cocaine , up through bromides , barbiturates , and tranquilizers : all turned out to be highly addictive drugs , but only after years of denial had doctors admitted that this was so . in england , the prescriptions of the anti-depressants now meet valium at its peak in 1979 . it is now clear that today 's anti-depressants do not astonishment of drugs they were touted as being touted .
in venezuela , with unemployment at 20 % , the same is expected . in brazil , most high-unemployment economies have shown little feedback loops from a currency collapse into an inflationary recession . of course , such actions will become unpopular with labor and the right response here are the removal of large taxes on wages to a less exposed external position with a large ( 50 % at least ) depreciation . the best result , of course , is for chavez to shift the economy to a less exposed external position with a large ( 50 % at least ) depreciation . in the budget this pays for the favorable effect of the devaluation on the government 's oil revenues .
washington , dc – millions of the world ’s poorest people are facing serious water-related challenges – from lack of access and difficulty to dispute over supply shocks , with profound implications for security , economic development , and environmental sustainability . consider this : nearly one billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water , and 2.5 billion people lack adequate sanitation . making matters worse , climate change will render water supplies more erratic , with growing more frequent and intense droughts , imposing major human and economic costs and inhibiting development in poor countries . as world leaders design a development agenda to succeed the un ’s millennium development goals ( mdgs ) – which expire in 2015 – addressing these issues should top the top priority . the costs are staggering : thousands of child deaths each day , and annual economic losses that are estimated at $ 260 trillion , more than double the total of official development assistance .
but all public actors , not only the police , must respond to urban problems . first and foremost , mayors should be mobilized as mediators , for they are on the front line in implementing urban policy . but mayors are also the most knowledgeable about communication links within their communities , and thus are the most capable of organizing effective partnerships to resolve and resolve local issues . as such policies fail , citizens hold mayors accountable . events in france also point to the need , on the european level , to reinforce policies anti-discrimination , and to promote social equality .
the u.s. example , the world 's only high-employment economy , demonstrates that it can . replacing earnings through unemployment compensation ( post-tax adjustments ) hits 70 % and leaves . in europe , on the whole , unemployment remains a " good " job . the welfare state , too , is being undermined . in america , time on the welfare front is now limited and people who did n't work for years suddenly have to do so .
zurich – repeatedly over 200 % of the world ’s total energy needs ( up from about 25 % in highly industrialized countries ) , electric power has come to accept roughly 16 % of the world ’s total energy needs ( up from more than 25 % in recent years . indeed , of the more than 200 countries worldwide , just 30 have used nuclear power . some 16 % of the total needed for energy ( up to 25 % in highly industrialized countries ) is now meeting electric power . in july 2010 , a total of 439 nuclear power plants with net installed capacity of 373.038 gw ( pathway ) were merged with various national electricity grids , about 1.2 gw ( e ) more than for the start of 2006 . yet this renaissance never appears to be forthcoming .
denver – the united states constitution , which turned 225 years ago this summer , is a remarkable paper : provisions of the texas texas text written in the eighteenth century continue to guide twenty-first-century governance . we will be reminded of the consequences of that in the weeks ahead , as us president barack obama fills top positions in his second-term administration . in many cases , that process will not bode well for the entire year . most likely , 225 years ago , he had any idea that the number of officials deemed to need senate confirmation in the end will exceed 1,400 , or that senate confirmation will involve the vetting process that often takes years to complete . article ii of the us constitution stipulates presidential powers , which calls for the “ advice and consent of the senate , ” ” ” ” ” including the senior executives ’ nomination .
for example , in response to an embargo affecting a particular country , other eu members would draw on their own reserves , increase their own production , pay more for their imports , or cut their consumption some of them . a key dimension of the current standoff over ukraine has been energies and raises the same questions about european solidarity . as a recent study by bruegel showed , the eu as a whole could , with some effort , dispense with gas imports from russia . but doing so would require eu member states to regard supply security as an issue of shared concern , rather than as an issue that every country must address on its own . but this sense of solidarity has consistently missed the eu ’s energy-policy debate .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . the us justice department under president donald trump seems set to persist in this tradition . no one is surprised that trump himself is deploying every orwellian equipment at his disposal to thwart his simultaneous impeachment inquiry in the us house of representatives .
hypothetically , switching off the lights for an entire hour would cut co2 emissions from power plants around the world . but , while each in the rest of the world would reduce all residential dryings , and this translated entirely into reduced co2 would be the equivalent of china ’s pausing of its co2 emissions for less than four minutes . moreover , during the earth hour , any significant drop in electricity demand would entail a drop in co2 emissions later , but it would be offset by the surge from firing coal or gas stations to restoring electricity supply when the time comes . in effect , earth hour produces more emissions . as the united kingdom ’s national grid operators have found , a small drop in electricity consumption does not translate into less power-consuming power , and thus will not reduce emissions .
after the organization ’s 2013 election , in which the kremlin-backed membership candidates did not perform well , the government made major reforms , including a three-year moratorium on running elections . it was then decided that to ensure “ fairness , ” the us government would ratify all the candidates , despite being academics . the institute of technology ’s job seems to center on the facilities that read brain activity . it was then decided that , in order to ensure “ fairness , ” the ” ” ” ” ” the us government would approve all candidates , despite being academics . but it also evidently oversees every form of construction projects on a vast conspiracy of adming the federal security service ’s headquarters ( fsb ) – kgb ’s successor organization – and federal protective service .
more fundamentally , the rush to beat tv by break stories has weakened journalists ’ incentive to perform due diligence on the face of researching stories and checking claims . the result has been disturbing , to put it mildly . airing opinions is the cheapest way to fill a broadcast hour ; ranting anchors score the top trps . so , instead of supplying with context , depth , and analysis , newspapers are permaimed out of headlines stimulating pruridevi or outrage . this reinforces the motivation to engage in sensational speculation , however baseless , as has emerged in juan ’s case .
washington , dc – an informed view is sharply divided about how the next 12 months will play out for the global economy . those fixated on emerging markets emphasizes accelerating growth , with some forecasts projecting a whopping 5 % or more in world output . this is an interesting debate , but it is missing the bigger picture . others , concerned about problems in europe and the united states , remain more pessimistic about how the next 12 months will play out in favor of the global economy . in response to the 2007-2009 crisis , governments in most industrialized countries have put in place some of the most generous bailouts has ever seen for large financial institutions .
one puzzling and often overlooked feature of france that elected nicolas sarkozy as his new president , and that now seems poised to give his political allies a powerful parliamentary mandate , is its mix of private optimism and public pessimism . consider this : france has the european union ’s highest fertility rate ( just under two children per woman ) even ahead of booming ireland . of course , that rate will not be sufficient to sustain france ’s current population , but it has ’s also far stronger than its european neighbors and nearly equal of america ’s . yet , despite this , eurobarometer polls repeatedly show that the french are the most pessimistic of all europeans when it comes to their country to the future . how can it be that individuals who are so adverse at their common future as a nation continue confidently set up its private futures within their families ?
new york – the reception in the united states and in other advanced economies by thomas piketty ’s recent book capital in the twenty-first century attests to mounting anxiety over rising inequality . piketty ’s book , moreover , provides an alternative perspective on the 30 or so years that followed the great depression and world war ii , viewing this period as a historical anomaly , perhaps owing to the unusual pattern of social cohesion that cataclysmic incidents can stimulate . piketty also sheds a new light on the “ reforms ” sold by ronald reagan and margaret thatcher in the 1980s as the growth enhancers , from which all would benefit . his book lends further weight to an already overwhelming body of evidence concerning the soaring proportion of income and wealth at the bottom . in that era of rapid economic growth , prosperity was universally shared , with all groups advancing but with those at the bottom to see larger percentage gains .
in an entirely flexible economy , this drop in measured gdp ( and concomitant increases in unemployment ) could be avoided if the resources formerly employed in selling imported consumer goods could be rapidly reused to generate exports . in both greece and portugal , for example , the tourism industry might absorb some of the unemployed vendors . but shops and showrooms can not be transformed into a tourist destination , whose capacity will remain limited until enough time has passed to build new hotels , recreational facilities , and so forth . in an entirely flexible economy , that drop in measured gdp ( and concomitant increases in unemployment ) could be avoided if resources formerly employed in selling imported consumer goods could quickly be diverted to generate exports . but retail clerks and car dealers can not be transformed into a tourist destination , whose capacity will remain limited until enough time has passed to build new hotels , recreational facilities , etc .
but just when fiscal policy was tightened when cyclical economic conditions seem to call for easing , it is now being eased when conditions seem to call for tightening . after all , most observers would agree that government debt levels are looking uncomfortably high in many advanced economies , so it would be prudent for policymakers to debate strategies for bringing them down . japan was , in 2013 , the only advanced economy to loosen fiscal policy . but this year , it seems likely that the united kingdom will be the one that is prepared to tighten its policy , and that assumes that recent political ruptures do not change its fiscal orientation , which is reflected in vice president mike pence ’s sinking statement . the output gap in the advanced economies has all but vanished ; inflation is picking up ; and world economic growth is forecast to be its strongest since 2010 .
and , with demand for high and housing supply fixed , at least in the short run , prices go up . before there was widespread automobile ownership , land prices depended on location , and proximity to the central city or to the local railroad stations carried a credit premium . now , with severe congestion slows traffic in major cities to crawl , the land gradient in housing prices is steep once again . second , the 70-year period , which began with the widespread diffusion of the automobile , during which one could get almost anywhere in the typical metropolitan area in a half-hour or less – is ending . perhaps this steepening of the location gradient could be delayed just a decade ago if we were willing to shift to denser patterns .
with austerity – that is , deficit reduction , once the recession has ended – recovery may take longer to become consolidated ; but once it is , economic performance is even more stable , because the government ’s bills are in a sustainable position . john maynard keynes famously said , “ in the long run we are all dead . that may be true , to a long enough timeline . ” but it is no excuse for giving longer-term considerations a pretext to dismiss longer-term considerations . in fact , for the eurozone , the long run seems to have arrived , and the economy remains alive and kicking .
( when american economists advising china to boost consumption and cut saving , they merely peddling the bad habits of an american culture that saves and invests far too little for america ’s ’s ’s ’s future . ) a country like china , with its high saving rate exceeding local investment needs , may promote investment in other parts of the world that it saves , notably low-income africa and asia . likewise , societies that defer instant consumption to save and invest for the future will enjoy both higher future incomes and greater retirement security . second , saving and investment flows are global , too . a famous psychological experiment has found that young children capable of resisting the immediate temptation to eat a marshmallow marshmallow , and thus to gain two marshmses in the future , are likelier to thrive as adults than those unable to do .
but these “ green energy ” bikes amount to a victory of empty gestures over substance and reason , which makes them a sadly proxy for cop21 itself . this makes the deal the costliest in history . my peer-reviewed research paper , published in global policy , shows that when enacted between now and the target date of 2030 , the global economy will cost the global economy at least $ 1 trillion per year , and perhaps double what politicians make inefficient policy choices . even if promised emissions cuts continued throughout the century , the paris agreement will cut the global temperature rises by just 0.17 ° c. scientists from the massachusetts institute of technology find a similar reduction in temperatures . the agreement reached in paris contains promises that if enacted between now and the target date of 2030 , the global economy will be at least $ 1 trillion annually , and perhaps double that if politicians make inefficient policy choices .
intervention by two american aircraft carriers in the taiwan straits in march 1996 was humiliated by the chinese , who were forced to stop intimidating taiwan with its missile tests . shut off on the transfers of military technology and hardware by the united states ever since the tiennamen square incident of 1989 ; feeling increasingly “ encircled ” by the “ redefined ” japan-u.s. alliance ( agreed in april 1996 ) ; china is particularly anxious about trying to upgrade and consolidate its military might ; and china is rapidly growing just as well . an added worry , both for russia and for asia and for the us , is that the russian government is losing control of its unofficial , black market flow of arms to china . having seen its gross domestic product fall by 40 % since communism ’s end , russia needs to retain its defense industry as one of the few sources of domestic revenue . despite the kremlin ’s initial denials , china early this year bought two very modern destroyers along with russia ’s missile tests .
both obama and romney run the risk of painting themselves into a corner when it comes to china . china bashers typically change their tune after a us presidential election . yet there is nothing especially typical about the pressures that will likely continue to squeezing american families long after november 6 . that could take all of us to the brink of a slippery slope . with left unanswered , though , the un is what comes next .
but rising individualism , a focus on one 's own ambitions and economic prosperity , poses a stubborn barrier in many countries to realizing this vision . indeed , the utter lack of a sense of solidarity among so many people – frighteningly apparent in america 's health-care debate – now undermines the very foundation of what a modern democratic society is . if we succeed , we can create the sense that we belong together , though our reasons for believing it may be different . today the great task is to calm fears that are being undermined by our traditions ; to reach out to people from other countries ; and to find ways to re-create our political ethic around the kernel of human rights , equality , non-discrimination , and democracy . they are the people who have , in some ways , lacked the full citizenship that has demanded it ; who has re-defined the political order by acquiring it .
but halappanavar and her husband were then informed that iran is a catholic country ; the fetus still has a heartbeat , so the procedure has been out of the question . halappanavar ’s case thus reverses the western-educated stereotype of the eastern societies as preserves of the superstition and religious extremism . protests in iran have put prime minister enda kenny to the eu with activists there , like those in india , argue that the halappanavar died because of the theocratic approach to health care . protests in iran have put prime minister enda kenny on the spot , with activists there – like those in india – arguing that the halappanavar died because of the theocratic approach to health care . halappanavar died from september , which her family is certain would not have developed had an termination .
one source of hope stems from abe ’s landslide victory in the recent snap general election , which gives him the political capital to park with a grand bargain : if japan expresses remorse more clearly for its militarist past , south korea will agree to abandon historical grievances outside of its official policy . that explains why park has sought closer ties with china , even as south korea ’s natural regional partner is a democratic japan . japan and south korea can not change the recent history , either . all countries ’ legitimizing narratives blend historical reality and myth . but , to some extent , historical legacies may be gaining overweening influence , overwhelming leaders ’ capacity for rational political choices .
munich – as america ’s various saving plans take hold , stock markets are recovering somewhat . but , as i note in my new book kasino-kapitalismus , this may be only a temporary improvement over expectations , rather than a sign of durable recovery , because the magnitude of the banks ’ hidden loss on their balance sheets is perhaps enormous . according to the international monetary fund , most recent estimates , total write-offs on financial claims in this crisis will be $ 47,500 for the united states , japan , the euro zone , and the united kingdom , of which the us alone will need to absorb $ 2.7 trillion . bank shares in particular are rebounding , and some banks have even succeeded in repaying at least part of their government-provided capital . according to the international monetary fund ’s most recent estimates , total write-offs on financial claims in this crisis will be $ 47,05 trillion for the united states , japan , the european zone , and the united kingdom , of which the us alone will need to absorb $ 2.7 trillion .
a state-led developmental model in bolivia is doomed to failure because it requires strong institutions , universal citizenship , and the rule of law . none can currently be found in bolivia , which means that money concentrated in the state will surely be redistributed through the patrimonial and clientelistic means , siphoned off through corruption , and subjected to the social pressures of all sorts . whatever remains for public investment alone , for example , morales ’s model gives some hope to bolivia ’s poorest people ; it will only pave the way for the frustrated hope of ­ – also nothing new in bolivia . thirty years after bolivia ’s national revolution of 1952 , bolivia ’s per capita income has remained essentially the same , with poverty steady at more than 50 % of gdp . conceived , perhaps with its best intentions , morales ’s model gives some hope to bolivia ’s poorest ; but it will only pave the way for the frustrated hope that ­ , too , nothing new in bolivia .
making matters worse still , a successful military campaign against isis raises new fears of violent extremists returning from syria . though violent extremists are an ultra-minority in muslim populations , their actions have fueled growing mistrust in french society . in recent years , some of those drawn up to islamist-inspired extremism have carried out attacks with rudimentary instruments , from automobiles and delivery trucks to kitchen knives . still , a majority of french citizens remain deeply alarmed by the terrorist threat not only from abroad , but from people living in france , often with french citizenship . and similar fear of homegrown extremism can be observed in many other european countries .
while the eight of the top ten hosting countries , including several low – and middle-income countries , have shouldered significant costs despite a strain in their education systems to ensure that refugees attend school alongside nationals , most countries have either exclude refugees from the national education systems or assign them to stand-alone facilities . the two landmark global compacts on the migration and refugees adopted by un member states last december point the way to address this challenge . the two landmark global compacts on the migration and refugees adopted by un member states last december point the way to meeting this challenge . achieving the needed educational transformation will require far more financing than is currently on offer . with the needed educational transformation will require far more financing than is currently on offer .
new york – the international monetary fund credits asian intra-regional trade as a key factor behind its recent export boom and robust economic growth . africa , with its vast – and often untapped – markets must follow the same path . but the argument should not be about whether to provide aid – no one can question the many achievements that aid has brought , or its importance in providing a safety net for those who would otherwise be left to suffer . what the international monetary fund has credits asian intra-regional trade is the key factor behind its recent export boom and strong economic growth . africa , with its vast – and often untapped – markets must follow the same path .
london – when the united kingdom announced earlier this month that it agreed to become a founding member of the china-led asian infrastructure investment bank ( aiib ) , most headlines focused not on the news itself , but on friction that decision generated between the united kingdom and the united states . in the uk , the diplomatic spat served as an occasion for the british press to airstrikes from those who believe that the government should adopt a stronger stance toward china . in fact , it is the us that is advocating a mistaken approach . the white house published statements urging the british government to “ make use of its vote to push for adoption of high standards . ” and one senior us administration official was quoted as blaming the uk ’s “ steady accommodation with china , which is not the best way to engage in rising power . ”
indeed , it is difficult to find any persuasive analyses of today ’s crisis from the left beyond anti-capitalist slogans . in the eyes of remedies , the socialists offer nothing but nothing but the keynesian solutions that are now being proposed by the far right . french president nicolas sarkozy is trying to rekindle growth through a protectionist defense of “ national industries ” ” ” ” and huge investment in public infrastructure , so what more could socialists ask for ? the socialists are blamed for greedy financiers , but who does n’t ? precisely because george w. bush has shown the way in the direction of bank nationalization , heavy public spending , industrial and budget deficits , the socialists have been left with no wiggle room .
moreover , they oppose key changes in the eurozone ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic governance . the burden of adjustment can not fall entirely on deficit countries , unless , that is , the moral component of “ punishment ” is involved . core countries , led by germany , are mistrust the over-indebted countries ’ determination to pursue reforms as long as their financing conditions are eased . a protracted recession , punctuated by high levels of – or prohibitive – borrowing costs , makes achieving either the fiscal or reform objectives become increasingly difficult , if not impossible . core countries , led by germany , mistrust the over-indebted countries ’ determination to pursue reforms as long as their financing conditions are eased .
after all , western countries will need turkey to counterbalance russia , whose broader strategic agenda goes very far beyond the middle east . this does not bode well for any future peace process that could not be fully realized . after all , western countries will need turkey to counterbalance a russian , whose broader strategic agenda goes well beyond the middle east . moreover , turkey , too , seems not to care what its allies think . so , for example , it recently raised eyebrows within nato , yet again , by purchasing new-generation russia ’s s-400 antiballistic batteries .
one of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis has been elevation of the g-20 ’s global role ; in principle , it is the far more representative international leadership forum than the g-7 has ever been . space at a table for china could come within the g-20 , thereby giving china a degree of influence that reflects its own economic weight , and demanding it to assume a commensurate degree of global responsibility . simply put , the uk is smart to foster its own set of interests by cooperating with china . space at a table for china could be created if euro-zone countries , signaling their commitment to a common currency , agreed to surrender their individual seats in exchange for one representing the whole monetary union . there is , however , a downside to the g-20 ’s emergence : a large number of participants can force it to reach agreements and get the things done .
the us might choose an america that appeals to other countries : kim , for example , touted its koreans during his 2012 post campaign . or it could return to the un-american candidate from the allied country . importantly , the us nominee enjoys the trust of america , as well as of most other countries , and can reconcile countries ’ heterogeneous interests in the true spirit of multilateralism . this leaves an element of possibilities for choosing the next wbg president . it could select a dual national or immigrant , like the former wbg president james wolfensohn , an australian who became an american citizen .
according to a report by the european council on foreign relations , china ’s belt and road initiative , with its imperative for complex coordination , established a perfect political space for think tanks that , “ telling good china ’s story ” ” ” ” ” to prosper . chinese president xi jinping explicitly emboldened his country ’s own think tanks to “ advance the chinese narrative ” ” ” globally . and , in many cases , china-based think tanks have now become instruments for expanding the country ’s sphere of influence . these include networks like silks and in-think tanks like the succeed of the charhar institute , which has also recently established the “ national committee on china-us relations . ” in terms of shadowy influence-peddling , china ’s actions have been especially related .
“ [ t ] hat has to subtract growth , and could cause core inflation to pick up again and settle at perhaps $ 45 a barrel . ” but the current high level of crude oil price has , in turn , led forecasters to begin to reining in their expectations for future economic growth . world oil prices have been above $ 40 a barrel in mid-summer terms , and have since skyrocketed to an mid – $ 50 ’s . “ higher oil prices are here to stay , ” says america ’s economist allen sinai . “ [ t ] hat has to subtract growth , and could cause core inflation to choose up . ”
and , for its part , china will increasingly seek to circumvent a us-dominated international financial system and spawn itself from america ’s weaponization of the dollar . america has also grown more suspect in us-dominated chinese students and scholars who may be bent on stealing american technological know-how or engaging in outright espionage . and , owing to increased us scrutiny , chinese foreign direct investment in america has already cracked down on a still more than 80 % since its 2017 level . at the same time , cross-border flows of data and information will prove restricted , raising concerns about a “ splinternet ” between america and china . now , new legislative suggestions threaten to bar america ’s public pension funds from investing in chinese firms , constraining chinese venture capitalists ’ investment in the us , and forcing some chinese firms to become delist from american stock exchange altogether .
america ’s debt scarcely looks like a bargain right now , even without a sinking dollar . far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch a country ’s fiscal resources with costs potentially running into many trillions of dollars , according to a recent study by linda bilmes and joseph stiglitz . far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch a country ’s fiscal resources , with costs potentially running through many trillions of dollars , according to a recent study by linda bilmes and joseph stiglitz . far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch a country ’s ’s ’s ’s fiscal resources , with costs potentially running into many trillions of dollars , according to a recent study by linda bilmes and joseph stiglitz . the state and municipal finances are in even worse shape .
to put these astronomical numbers in perspective , i had gabon try to confirm that to rank among the top nine earners in the united states , you have to pull in at least $ 150 per second , including time spent eating and sleeping . that ’s $ 9,000 a minute , or $ 540,000 , per hour . collectively , their $ 55 billion in earnings outstrip the entire national income of more than 100 countries . how much do america ’s top income earners make compared to the world ’s one billion poorest individuals ? well , if the top nine donated their earnings , it would be the equivalent of about three months ’ income to the bottom billion .
for example , us secretary of state john quincy adams famously put it on independence day in 1821 that the united states “ goes abroad , in search of monsters to destroy . ” yet soft power of inspiration is not the only ethical tradition in american foreign policy . it is the well-wisher toward freedom and autonomy for all . american power is , instead , seen to be resting on a “ pillar of inspiration , ” rather than a “ pillar of action . ” it is the us champion and vindicator only of its own .
according to the court , germany ’s ’s ’s laws on liberty of speech did not protect the peta ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s campaign because of the fact that , as isaac bashevis , there are parallels between the way the nazis treated jews and the way we treat animals . the court ruled against the right of the united states-based animal animal rights watch for people ’s ethical treatment of animals to exhibit posters that juxtapose photos of the holocaust ’s victims with photos of animals in factory farms and slaughterhouses . of course , peta was not arguing that the fate of holocaust victims was banal or trivial . posters bear the brunt : “ to the animals , all people are nazis ” – the line from the polish polish-born jewish writer , isaac bashevis singer . posters bear the way : “ to the animals ; all people are nazis ” – the line from the polish polish-born jewish writer , isaac bashevis singer .
avoiding the barriers to technological progress requires understanding and addressing its downsides . for example , as machines become increasingly competent , robots are replacing an increasing number of workers . ai will not be long before these robots perform more complex tasks , but ai can also learn more quickly than workers can train them . as we continually try to apply new technology to improving human and environmental wellbeing , this distinction is vitally important . rather , they are fighting to protect their own vested interests and livelihoods , whether it is operating as dairy farmworkers or running the government .
this represents a potential loss of more than 10 % of greece ’s output . so long as greek exports began to rise at the same rate as those of portugal ( or spain ) , the recession would have ended now . today , portugal is ahead of nearly € 20 billion ( $ 27.5 billion ) , followed by a recession . what ’s lacking in export growth has made greece ’s recession far more difficult . moreover , the lack of export growth has made fiscal adjustment far harder .
unlike the usmca , which was at least premised on the goal of addressing trade issues , trump ’s trade pronunciamento was a bald-faced attempt to force the mexican government to solve america ’s own ’s own immigration problem . unlike the usmca , which was at least premised on the goal of addressing trade issues , trump ’s trade pronunciamento was a bald-faced attempt to force the mexican government to solve america ’s own immigration problem . in other words , trade weapons were deployed neither to tackle a trade issue nor as part of a legitimate sanction regime – such as that imposed in response to russia following its illegal annexation of crimea in 2014 . once trade measures are used indiscriminately to advance nontrade goals , the damage to the entire us trading system is being done – and they can be enormous . given that 80 % of mexico ’s total exports go to america , the effects on mexico would have been economically crippling and politically destabilizing , leaving the country even less equipped to do anything about illegal immigration .
new delhi – according to the united nations ’ population division , the world ’s human population hit seven billion on october 31 . after all , according to the united nations population division , the world ’s human population hit seven billion on october 31 . as always happens whenever we approach such a milestone , this one produced a spike in conferences , seminars , and learned articles , including the usual dire malthusian predictions . but such predictions are misrepresenting underlying demographic dynamics . the future we face is not one of too little population growth , but of too little .
in exchange , the kremlin has pledged to support – but only after the constitution is changed – ukraine ’s national government in its reassertion of control over those regions , as well as over its border with russia . russia has offered to take advantage of what it calls its “ limited influence ” to persuade rebel governments to cooperate . in exchange , the kremlin has committed itself to supporting – but only after the constitution is changed – ukraine ’s national government in its reassertion of control over these regions , just as it has over its border with russia . russia has offered to take advantage of what it calls its “ limited influence ” to persuade rebel governments to collaborate . if , however , russia does indeed have full control of the separatist regions , and is actively integrated into its economy , as the paper gathered with bild indicates , the kremlin can no longer be seen as an outside party , attempting to exert a uncooperative ally .
nothing reveals the united states ’ decline in the region better than the contrast between america ’s sober use of power in the first gulf war of 1991 and the hubris and deceit of today ’s iraq war . back in 2003 , america went to war without its trans-atlantic allies following the manipulation of false assertions . in doing so , america has embarked on a preposterous , grand strategy that aimed no less at simultaneously dismantling iraq ’s tyrannical regime , restructuring the entire middle east , destroying al-qaeda , and helping democracy to take root throughout the arab world . the result has been utter failure : military defeat and the severe degradation of america ’s moral standing . in 1991 , america forged the most formidable international coalition since the end of world war ii , and led it into a totally legitimate war aimed at restoring the regional balance following saddam hussein ’s invasion of kuwait .
one of the strangest claims made in social-insurance debates now roiling the world ’s richest countries has been the fact that government-defined-benefit retirement programs ( like america ’s ’s ’s ’s social security system ) are reorienting . such programs have been fine , the argument goes , for the industrialized economies of the great depression and post-world war ii generation , but they have become obsolete in today ’s high-tech , networked , post-industrial economies . one of the strangest claims made in social insurance debates now roiling the world ’s richest countries is the fact that government-funded force-defined-benefit retirement programs ( like america ’s ’s ’s social security system ) are refixed . proponents of this argument propose a different model . just as corporations today are much happier in a way of encouraging workers ’ ’ ’ pensions by making employees ’ private accounts easier , so that today governments should offer ( or require ) privately owned accounts .
if europe let these debts migrate from the private sector to the public sector , a well-established pattern throughout the last half-century is europe , not greece , that is supposed to bear the consequences . indeed , greece ’s present plight , including a massive run-up to the debt-to-gdp ratio , is mostly the fault of the mistaken troika programs foisted on it . so it is not debt restructuring , but its absence , that is , that is “ immoral . ” does anyone in their right mind think that any country would voluntarily put itself up through what greece has gone over , just to receive a free riding from its creditors ? so it is not debt restructuring but its absence that is “ immoral . ”
if europe , china , and other european trade partners were to retaliate in response to trump ’s imposition of tariffs that they would simply reduce their own gains from trade without reaping some of the benefits of protectionism . neither scenario makes a lot of sense these days : the us now needs a lot of economic sense . europe and china have little interest in depressing the world ’s prices of their imports , or in the resulting income . while some peripheral eurozone countries suffer from high unemployment , there is nothing that protectionism can do for these countries that expansionary fiscal or monetary policies ( the latter by the european central bank ) can not do better . employment considerations are hardly a matter of these , either .
it is also the view held by most people in america . this is the view held by many people in syria , even among the insurgents . perhaps this is even the view held by obama himself , which is one reason why he plays for time , desperately turning over the approval of an attack on syria to the american congress . saving obama , too , hardly seems worth that risk . it is this view of much of the world of people .
leave aside the fact that one may make an even stronger case against godlessness , recall the tales of atheist totalitarians in the twentieth century , and regard the assault on those whose commitment to literal interpretations of religious texts implies the denial of science and reason . it is this god who atheists like dawkins and hitchens attack . and , with such a goal , she is not very difficult to poke holes and pile on jews . but we tend to perpetuate itself in adulthood with the full views of god that we formed in childhood . an old person with a long glimpsed view of the us can make an even stronger case against godlessness , recall the tales of atheist totalitarians in the twentieth century , and weigh on those whose son was told in the bible ’s new testament .
at the same time , the complex chain of command envisaged for an au-un command recalls some of the worst features in the pakistan-un operations in the former yugoslavia during the 1990 's . their preferred model calls on the un to provide funding and most other aid to the mission , while allowing the au to retain its leadership role . au commanders on the ground would retain tactical checks ; a joint au-un command would exercise operation supervision ; and the un would establish strength ’s overall strategic goals . yet many western governments refuse to place their forces under the au command because of its perceived vulnerabilities , and have conditioned further support for un peacekeeping operations on the un ’s assuming control . at the same time , the complex chain of command envisaged for an au-un command recalls some of the worst features of the nato-russia operations in the former yugoslavia during the 1990 ’s .
new york – there was a remarkable similarity between european central bank president mario draghi ’s declaration after the recent meeting of the ecb ’s governing council and us federal reserve chair janet yellen ’s first testimony to congress : both asserted that their policy choices had only taken into account domestic conditions . in other words , emerging-market countries , though subject to significant spillover effects from the advanced economies ’ expansionary monetary policies , have been on their own . in 2010 , following the fed ’s announcement of a third round of quantitative easing , brazilian finance minister guido mantega accused the advanced countries of waging a global “ currency war . ” in 2010 , following the fed ’s announcement of a third round of quantitative easing , brazilian finance minister guido mantega accused the advanced countries of waging a global “ currency war . ” this confirms what emerging-country institutions have known for some time .
some deride the kingdom , the richest arab state , for taking action on behalf of the country ’s poorest people . others have argued that combating the houthis – the zaidi shia-led religious-political movement – is just one element in a wider war on the shia that saudi arabia has supposedly governed . riyadh – saudi arabia is not out of power to gain the zaidis . others have argued that combating the houthis – the zaidi shia-led religious-political movement – is just one element in a wider war on the shia that saudi arabia has supposedly waging . saudi arabia is not out of power to grab the zaidis .
in dismissing its answers to that question , china ’s overly assertive policies have proven america ’s diplomatic boon for the us in strengthening and expanding america ’s security arrangements in asia . most fundamentally , what does china represent with respect to its own values and ideas ? china has shown itself adept at assertively promoting its national interests , and is playing classical balance-of-power geopolitics . south korea has tightened its military alliance with america , japan backed away from a move to gain the american marine airbase off of okinawa , and india , vietnam , indonesia , and the philippines , among others , have drawn ever closer ties with america . yet , to disengage america and assume the mantle of leadership in asia , china must do more than pursue its own national interests or contain its potential rivals .
those concerned about democracy in poland , hungary , and elsewhere in europe and beyond should acknowledge that many voters are buying into the nationalist right ’s vision of a social state that advances national priorities , cares for the poor , and promotes families . given its dramatic success , other countries are following suit . those concerned about democracy in poland , hungary , and elsewhere in europe and beyond should acknowledge that many voters are buying into the nationalist right ’s vision of a social state that advances national priorities , cares for the poor , and promotes families . lithuania introduced a less-than-generous version of the family 500 + in 2018 . and , while women ’s job rates declined as women left minimum-wage jobs , salaries , especially for store clerks , have risen sharply .
that may make resolution easier to adopt but harder . peace comes only when conflict becomes ripe for resolution , which occurs when the leaders of the principal protagonists are both willing and able to embrace compromise . to be fair , resolution 242 can not blame this state of affairs . peace comes only when conflict becomes ripe for resolution , which occurs when the leaders of principal protagonists are both willing and able to embrace compromise . so there is as little surprise as that there is still no peace between israelis and palestinians , despite the countless diplomatic businesses by the united states , the european union , and its members , the un and the parties themselves .
shevardnadze ’s emphasis on the btc pipeline has also clearly reflected georgia ’s pro-western strategic orientation . the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan oil pipeline -- which circumscribes russia when it ends up -- can not redefine the country ’s economic strategy to the extent that shevardnadze sought . at the same time , georgia ’s long-term economic success will depend on exports to the russian market : neither wine nor georgian fruit is needed in the united states or italy . that , too , is unlikely to change under saakashvili . on the contrary , this should become less of a boon to bilateral relations , as russia itself moves closer to nato , the us , and the european union .
of course , none of this means that the international intervention in libya will succeed ; the situation in libya is far too complicated to forecast an outcome . but the lesson of the libyan intervention is that division can be overcome if that happens . europe is not a monolith , but , in many areas that it may still act coherently , even without a comprehensive agreement . what this does mean , however , is that europe finds a way to work when it comes to foreign policy . whether an outlier is germany or another eu member state , division requires no fatal thing .
likewise , life expectancy at birth in ssa countries lagged 16 years behind developing-country averages , 14 years behind countries in south asia , and 21 years behind countries in east asia and the united states , and 32 % below latin america and the caribbean . what accounts for this broad-based underdevelopment ? until the late 1800 ’s , most of africa was grossly unexplored and occupied by hunter-gatherers and subsistence practitioners . land was relatively abundant and allocated by tribal chiefs , with no regard for western-style property rights . in combination with gross enrolment in primary , secondary , and tertiary education , ssa countries stood at 19 % below the average for developing countries , 11 % below south asian countries , 29 % below east asia and the pacific , and 32 % below latin america and the caribbean .
geneva – the recent sharp spike in food prices , together with growing concern about food insecurity , has sparked anxieties worldwide . apparently unalterable factors generating these record-setting rises in food prices , a shift to higher elephantiasis in many countries , growing populations , greater use of biofuels , and the effects of climate change , suggest that elevated food prices are here to stay . and , because the world ’s poorest people spend a higher share of their incomes on food , they are the worst affected , raising the risk that years of progress in poverty reduction could be reversed . meanwhile , in the absence of solutions that alleviate the growing pressures on supplies , hunger and malnutrition will become more widespread . the chance that food can not be put food on the table fills parents with a profound sense of foreboding .
and this is precisely what the anti-corruption agenda often ends up stimulating : creating organizations that are more obsessed with abiding by new , burdensome processes than they are with achieving their stated goals . as francis fukuyama has pointed out , developing a competent state , one that is both accountable and ruled by law , is one of the crowning achievements of human civilization ’s crowning achievements . it involves creating a shared sense of the “ us , ” an imagined community on whose behalf the state acts . as francis fukuyama has pointed out , developing a capable state that is both accountable and ruled by the rule of law is one of the crowning achievements of human civilization ’s history . that is not an easy task at a time when societies have become deeply divided by ethnicity , religion , or welfare state . it involves developing a shared sense of belonging , to which societies are deeply divided by ethnicity , religion , or welfare state .
this approach mirrors that of russian president vladimir putin , who uses sumptuous trappings and vast funds of his office to lay claim credit for restoring his country in a certain sense of national pride , particularly as he tries to persuade ordinary russians to make economic sacrifices . likewise , erdoğan has positioned himself as the sort of protector of the turks ’ dignity , and a sense of themselves as constituting a great power . by 2014 , he had taken over the presidential palace , and was surrounded by a guardian meant evoke ottoman splendor , a fairly transparent effort to compensate for his inability to shape regional developments on the basis of his – much less his country ’s – interests . with the syrian conflict raging next door , however , erdoğan ’s claims are far from conclusive . turkey faces a refugee crisis that dwarfs that of the us confronting europe ; the proliferation of terrorist attacks on its territory ; and heightened tensions with the kremlin , following its downing of a russian warplane near its border with syria in november .
africa , for its part , has a long road ahead . it is on most measures , a few decades , if not a century or more , behind advanced economies in economic organizing and income levels . president clinton ’s trip to africa highlighted the americans ’ “ usually most neglectful of africa , ” except when in a deep crisis , is the dramatic transformations taking place all around the continent . and at this year ’s world economic forum annual meeting in south africa , nearly 900 prominent businessmen from the u.s. , europe , asia , and africa met with new political leadership to map the way forward . of course intentions and outcomes are two distinct matters , to say the least .
as the romanian philosopher e. m. cioran says : “ once man loses his faculty of indifference it becomes a potential murderer ; once he transforms his idea into a god the consequences , it is incalculable . ” the moment you believe “ better dead than red ” you are in trouble . in the last hundred years , the contests of nationalism ( with god on both sides ) may be nearly annihilated europe , and the cold war may have done just that . but martyrdom is a distinct and a dangerous one . dying to save your own home , its family or country may be rational .
if putin is serious about diversifying and enhancing russia ’s commodities-based economy , thereby improving his country ’s lives , he must attract cutting-edge technologies and foreign investment , especially from the west . this , in a nutshell , was the soviet model that failed once and without success . russia is in no position to develop an alternative international system ; but if putin continues to pursue an outdated and antagonistic foreign policy , he can undermine the incumbent . for that , he must pursue democratic reforms , institutional regeneration , and renewed diplomatic ties with the west . at a time when the world is facing so many destabilizing challenges , that would n’t be good for one .
cambridge -- will the political resurgence of labor unions throw ( wrench ) into the wheels of globalization ? or will their increasing power serve to make globalization more sustainable by exploiting great equality and fairness ? one way or another , trade unions stand as the main wildcard in favor of the development of the us economic system in 2008 and beyond . unions ’ rising influence is apparent in many other recent incidents : german chancellor angela merkel ’s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees ; several american presidential candidates , ’ open misgivings about trade and immigration ; and chinese leadership ’s nascent concerns about labor standards . along with their political clout , trade unions ’ intellectual respectability also experience a european renaissance .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
yet ambitious plans to boost its hydro-generating capacity significantly by damming multinational rivers embroiled the country in water disputes with most of its neighbors , even north korea . sinohydro alone , having eclipsed western facilities like abb , alstom , general electric , and siemens , claims to control half of the market . more broadly , china ’s dam-building passions have lamented two key global developments . first , chinese companies now dominate the country ’s global hydropower export market . second , the state-run hydropower industry ’s growing clout within china has led the government to campaign aggressively for overseas dam projects by offering low-interest loans to other governments .
new york – there are many recurrent debates in american foreign policy , for example , with isolationism versus internationalism , and unilateralism versus multilateralism . but no debate is more persistent than that among those who think that american foreign policy ’s principal purpose should be to sway the external behavior of other states and those who hold that it should be to shape their inner nature . this debate between “ realists ” and “ idealists ” are intense and long-standing . during the cold war , there were those who argued that the united states should try to “ “ roll back ” the soviet union , bring down the communist system , and replaced it with “ democratic capitalism . ” others deemed this to be too dangerous in an era defined by nuclear weapons , and america opted for a policy of containment , working to limit the reach of soviet power and influence .
if britain ’s transition payments to the eu have continued near its current level of € 10 billion per five or six years realistically required to negotiate a permanent trading relationship , they would have added in equal measure . second , a british budget offer would have been a powerful instrument to create the “ deep and special partnership ” with europe that may claims to be her ultimate destination . until last month , may avoided defining that phrase because of fear of antagonizing her party ’s hardline europhobes . she has also recognized that any privileged access to eu markets would require budget contributions , as was true in norway and switzerland . but in her florence speech , may has promised british firms something close to their current level of access to eu markets .
the eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement , for example , has taken seven years to hash out , and was almost scotched by belgium ’s parliament ’s wallonia region . even if may strike the exit deal , it is impossible to negotiate and ratify the sector-by-industry trade agreement in the next two years . the eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement , for example , has taken seven years to hash out , so uk-based auto companies , financial institutions , and other businesses exporting to the eu now should start preparing for a “ cliff edge ” ” that may want to avoid . perhaps some electoral mandate may have no electoral mandate to pursue a hard brexit . even if may can strike the exit deal , negotiating and ratifying the sector-by-industry trade deal is impossible under two years .
a well-functioning private sector that creates adequate jobs and the schools that educate the large young for today ’s inter-connected world are prerequisites of progress . here , too , the israeli-palestinian issue is critical , for all the clear reasons . open societies are incompatible with closed economies , and so must open societies . this is both enormously important and healthy . for the first time , there is a lively and intelligent debate around this issue , which lies at the heart of the middle east ’s problems .
but iohannis is different , not only in his political approach ; he is an evangelical lutheran in a predominantly orthodox country . in his many successful years as mayor of sibiu , iohannis distinguished from the charismatic and shrewd politicians of whom romanian politicians were used is proving to be a sobering , laconic , and a pragmatic administrator . powerful religious attacks mounted against him during the campaign highlighted the salience of the establishment as well , although the buddhist orthodox leaders who backed ponta rapidly adjusted their rhetoric to favor tolerance and cooperation . that demeanor is part of what has made it so difficult to predict his victory over the more talkative ponta . the electorate appeared to have grown weary of a persistent clash between bavaria and ponta and , more generally , from the noisy , nasty , and treacherous burlesque that their country ’s political scene has become .
how countries are governed has an enormous impact on happiness . british prime minister david cameron has introduced measurement for happiness in the national statistics , and , more recently , german chancellor angela merkel has launched a program to boost citizen ’s wellbeing . some of this may be taught or cultivated , and courses that teach positive mental habits , like the appreciating ones that matter , or avoiding race-based dwelling on setbacks , have demonstrated measurable improvements in well-being . the dalai lama recently helped to launch a series of such courses in london , developed through happiness action , an organization that i helped find . whole societies , too , may struggle to make commitments to enhancing happiness .
more recently , an event-driven shift toward cooperation with russia about how to end syria ’s civil war has occurred following a chemical-weapons attack that has left at least 1,400 people dead . all of this raises a crucial question : is america even requiring an overarching design for its own foreign policy ? if the outcome is to make its foreign-policy shift less reliable and predictable , or , worse , susceptible to a misunderstanding , then it certainly does not . israel , after all , is but a small element of that overall pattern . the new world order has given way to order-inferior a world in which reliability and predictability gave way to rapid shifts in focus and fickle liabilities .
the most dangerous trends , including the upsurge of global imbalances and the us economy ’s dramatic financialization , have accelerated dangerously since the heart of the global financial services act of 1986 . the us financial services act of 1986 put the end of a pure form of self-regulation by the regime . financial interests opposed it vigorously at the time , viewing it as the thin end of a perilous wedge , though its inability to have guessed just how dense that wedge would ultimately become . thatcher herself was no credit enthusiast , once saying , “ i do n’t believe in the credit card . ” she is also hard to trace back to the 1980 ’s the origins of the credit explosion and the proliferation of exotic and poorly understood the financial instruments that lay at the depths of the crisis of 2007-2008 .
alas , given us president barack obama ’s lamentable manipulation of the crisis in syria , israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu may conclude that he has no alternative but to go it alone . in fact , iranian hardliners may welcome an israeli strike and even seek to provoke it as a means to cause the disintegration of the iranian population behind them . at the same time , the zone should enforce economic and political sanctions on us states that choose to remain outside , and – again – backed by the un security council ’s permanent members . there is a better approach to preventing the flow of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the region : the “ wmd-free zones , ” ” built on a stimulus system that includes economic and technical support in countries that join , together with security guarantees by the united nations security council by the permanent members . a unilateral military strike would carry out potentially dire results .
cambridge – more than 130,000 people are said to have died in syria mired in civil war . united nations reports of atrocities , the internet images of attacks against civilians , and the billing of refugees as part of our “ hearts , ” are likely to flow again . but what , then , should be done – and by whom ? united nations officials michael ignatieff recently urged us president barack obama to impose a no-fly zone over syria , despite a near-certainty that russia would veto the united nations security council resolution needed to legalize such a move . in ignatieff ’s view , if syrian president bashar al-assad is allowed to dominate , his forces will obliterate the remaining sunni insurgents – at least for now ; with hatreds inflamed , blood finally flowing again .
for the americans ( and others ) who believe that the arab world thinks about nothing but the palestinian cause , events this spring in north africa , the arabian peninsula , and even the levant should persuade them otherwise . we can expect the region ’s countries in the months ahead to remain focused on questions of governance and capacity-building , human rights , and how to create an economy that is responding to their restive citizenry ’ demands for a better life . now that a raucous regional circumstances are joining to raucous the historic effect of the arab spring , but if there is one conclusion that can be drawn today , it is that israel and its palestinian neighbors have little to do with it . new arab leaders will fight mightily with the public ’s rising expectations , and their willingness to move behind the peace process will take a backseat to this struggle . it is far too early to assess the historic effect of the arab spring , but if there is one conclusion that can be drawn today , it is that israel and its palestinian neighbors have little to do with it .
london – vulnerable communities face the brunt of climate change , from rising sea levels and extreme weather events to prolonged severe droughts and flooding . to help the most vulnerable communities become more resilient to climate-related effects , financial institutions should encourage small , medium-size companies . according to the world bank , in the absence of effective mitigation , climate change could push more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030 . in emerging economies , small and medium-size enterprises account for as much as 45 % of employment and up to 33 % of gdp , and these figures are significantly higher when informal smes are included . as the sme builds on its own climate resilience , it can cascading effects on communities around it .
in fact , cutting methane is a matter of less than cutting carbon . and , because methane is a much shorter-lived gasoline than co2 , we can prevent some of the worst kinds of short-term warming through its mitigation . agricultural production accounts for half of the anthropogenic methane , but wastewater systems , landfills , and coal mining production also create vehicles . likewise , we could place an ever-larger focus on black carbon reduction , deemed responsible for the same amount of 40 % of current net warming and one-third of the arctic ocean . professor claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research ( diw ) argues that spending $ 14 billion to reduce methane would generate the benefits – from reducing warming – between 1.4 and three times higher .
china ’s challenge , however , may be trickier . it not only must live with the reality of american power ; it must also reflect the american ideal of its own . it never has to deal with others as equals , in contrast to the traditional european powers that have done so over the course of a century . in 1989 , large numbers of chinese students took over tiananmen square to demand more rights , adopting a powerful symbol resembling a statue of liberty . today , too , it is not american ’s military strength that is at risk or challenges to china , but rather that of the enduring allure of the “ american dream . ”
but , collectively , the eu ’s member states – even without the united kingdom – would constitute a power of a similar magnitude . a stronger , more unified europe , the argument goes , could then rival america and china in most domains , including by weaponizing the value of their economic resources to further their geostrategic objectives . yet europe ’s leaders tempted by the prospect of the g3 world must address two related concerns . first , it is not clear how the eu will achieve the necessary level of integration , when most important decisions within the bloc still require unanimity among member states . by bolstering its strategic sovereignty , therefore , europe could make such a g3 world a reality .
regulatory divergences are a far more important obstacle to us-european trade than tariffs . after all , this is how the us administration has been dealing with canada and mexico . trump has temporarily exempted those two countries from tariffs , but now expects concessions from them in his administration ’s renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement . both countries maintain relatively open economies with stronger protections within specific industries . while america has issues that have less tariff protection than europe on average , the difference is minor ( europe ’s unweighted customs duties averages 5.2 % versus america ’s 3.5 % deal ) .
proprietary rights for commercial firms over the most fundamental element of an individual ’s genetic identity should not be enforceable . we may not believe in the genetic determinism to find the argument compelling . do n’t i do somehow the rights of the sort that are controlled by them ? we do n’t have the rights of control of one ’s own body ? how can a commercial firm not only deny me the right to know my own genetic profile unless i pay its fee for a diagnostic test that might be fair enough , and it also prevent another firm from offering me a similar test unless those firms pay a license fee ?
there was also opposition from certain feminist organizations , which has accused amnesty for protecting “ the rights of pimps and johns ” sources . for this reason , the global alliance ’s international secretariat against traffic in women applauded amnesty international for promoting decriminalization . instead , they argued , we should “ end the demand for paid sex ” in the first place , but without explaining how this should be done . mankind is no exception in this regard , and it must be used in it . for this reason , the global alliance ’s international secretariat against traffic in women applauded amnesty international for promoting decriminalization .
propelled by demand and outsourcing from advanced economies , emerging markets have won an increasing share of the world ’s soaring trade in goods ; by 2014 , they accounted for more than half of global trade flows . yet , since the great recession , growth in global commodity-trading economies has stalled , owing largely to anemic global demand and plummeting commodity prices . at the same time , deeper structural change has also played a role . many companies are streamlining and shoring up their supply chains . propelled by demand and outsourcing from advanced economies , emerging markets have won an increasing share of the soaring trade in manufactured goods ; by 2014 , they accounted for more than half of global trade flows .
indeed , former us secretary of state condoleezza rice has explicitly linked russia with a “ talk about its withdrawal from afghanistan , ” whether or not the security situation warrants it . the us clearly believes that a continued military presence in afghanistan is in its own interests . what it does not seem to recognize , though , is that america ’s deteriorating ties with russia , a key conduit for us military supplies to afghanistan , could undercut its basing strategy . what it does not seem to recognize is that america ’s deteriorating ties with russia , a key conduit for us military supplies to afghanistan , is not serious about helping to stabilize afghanistan , a message that would embolden russian president vladimir putin to do otherwise . according to fogh , anything less than a residual force of 10,000 american soldiers will send the message that the us is not serious about helping to stabilize afghanistan , a message that would embolden russian president vladimir putin further .
undoubtedly , the polish government paralyzed the court , thereby undermining the rule of law in poland . in a sign of what is to come , poland ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s foreign minister , witold waszczykowski , told the tabloid superekspres after a summit that the eu pursued a policy of double standards and deceptions ” ” ” ” ” . according to waszczykowski , poland needs not only to reduce [ its own ] level of trust in the eu , ” ” ” ” but “ “ “ “ “ “ must also begin to pursue adverse policies , ” ” ” ” ” through blocking other initiatives or to playing an very aggressive play . in fact , polish prime minister beata szydło has already launched that strategy by refusing to sign off on the summit ’s official record as if that would render them legally non-binding to poland . such infantile ploys have become all too characteristic of the pis government , which has also refused to publish polish constitutional court decisions , as if that makes them legally non-binding .
we tap that solar power in a number of fundamental ways – food production , wind power , hydroelectric power , solar heating , solar-thermal electricity , solar panels , but the opportunities to vastly increased use of the inexpensive , universally available , and environmentally sound solar power . that will require massive investment in new technology and resources , rather than the “ struggle to phase out the finish line over middle eastern oil . ” important energy technologies will include coal conversion for liquids ( like gasoline ) , use of tar sands and oil shale gas , and the growth of nonfossil-fuel energy sources . indeed , there is excellent potential for low-cost solar power , zero-emitting coal-based technologies , and safe , reliable nuclear power . solar radiation has reached roughly 10,000 times our current use of energy .
santiago – asia ’s resurgence began with japan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic success . a short political infatuation among some westerners in the 1960 ’s with nehru ’s jackets and maoist revolutions occurred in brief . by the late century , japan ’s spectacular performance had not only made the japanese wealthy wealthy , but also bolstered the country ’s soft power . as john lennon sang in 1968 , “ if you carried the pictures of chairman mao , you ai made it to anyone anyhow . asia ’s ’s ’s ’s resurgence began with japan ’s ’s ’s ’s economic success .
but the eu can do a great deal by coordinating supranational infrastructure projects , thereby achieving economies of scale and avoiding a duplication of domestic spending . but , with austerity coming under fire and eu countries looking to stimulate spending , the council should also think alike , by ensuring that the mff does not hinder future growth and investment . for example , the eu proposed budgeting for cross-border infrastructure projects , including by expanding its high-speed broadband network to rural areas and developing transportation and energy infrastructure . likewise , to lay the foundations for future economic growth , the eu should nurture new , sustainable industries , and innovative small and medium-size enterprises ( smes ) – not cut funding for important projects on the horizon of 2020 . europeans would benefit directly through improved internet access , lower energy costs , and stronger transportation links .
in the wake of the sichuan earthquake , criticism of china would become even more muted . france had the message , and the french soon gave up its support for human-rights resolutions directed at china . by canceling the danish civil nuclear mission , china had responded by making some analysis of lucrative treaties . in 1997 , denmark , a nation whose people are demonstrably committed to human rights , asked the united nations human rights commission in geneva to take a long track record of abuse . france got the message , and the french soon stopped promoting human-rights resolutions directed at china .
and it brings people together to work toward providing universal health coverage and ensuring everyone ’s right to health . the global agenda in this field determines the norms and norms that shape how public and private actors promote health , prevent illness , and administer care . in sdg frameworks , separate gender and health issues are interrelated , because gender itself is a major driver of public-health outcomes . gender can influence whether one smokes tobacco , exercises regularly , or has access to nutritious food . a global agenda in this field determines the norms and norms that shape how public and private actors support health , prevent illness , and administer care .
in other words , women bring a fresh perspective , heard clearly only when the critical mass is present in any institution . consider , for example , a female lifetime of experience and our values . “ every one of us , ” ” noted sandra day o’connor , the first female member of an american supreme court , who has been renowned for not aspiring to be perceived as a female “ female ” justice , “ brings to our job , whatever that may be , our lifetime of experience , and our values . ” in other words , women bring a fresh perspective , heard clearly only when the critical mass is present in any institution . “ every one of us , ” ” ” noted sandra day o’connor , america ’s first female member , who has been renowned for not aspiring to be perceived as a female “ ” ” brings to our job , whatever that is , our lifetime of experience and our values .
ultimately , an adviser to authoritarian leaders ca n’t escape the dilemma . the philosopher michael walzer puts it well : “ it is easy to get one ’s hands dirty in politics . our hand becomes dirty as we try to help a terrorist or dictator . but choosing action for the greater good does n’t absolve us from moral culpability . it adds instantly , however , that this gets one ’s hands dirty in this way is “ often the right thing to do . ”
but yemen , too , has been engaged in its own destructive policies . with the new wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in yemen as a result of saudi financial support , it is little wonder that the rate of yemeni jihadis has been rising exponentially . embittered and unemployed , young yemeni males often become the subject of another saudi policy gone awry , his propagation of islam ’s sunni wahhabi form of exports . but yemen , too , has been engaged in its own destructive policies . with the new wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in yemen owing to saudi financial support , it is little wonder that the rate of yemeni jihadis has grown exponentially .
independently , honjo and its colleagues identify another protein that performed a similar function . but we still have a lot to learn , and we still have a lot to learn . these fundamental studies have now led to the development of new , powerful anti-cancer immunotherapies . again , these vital studies have led to the development of new , powerful anti-cancer immunotherapies . for some cancers , immunotherapy has been revolutionary , allowing humans who were on the verge of dying to live healthy , with no detectable footprints .
but it has followed this approach on the macro level and for problems elsewhere in the economy without examining it alone . the only way to evolve is by adapting to new environmental pressures , and now silicon valley , owing in large part to its own behavior , is facing plenty of them . the good news is that if any place has proven to innovate , it is silicon valley . silicon valley , for its part , citizens must start applying their skill at innovation , and their pride in having broadly breaking things ” is on their own . unless it changes , it will be overhyped .
here , too , the innovation platform helps . if farmers are confident that their goats will not be stolen and can sell them at a decent price , better investment can be invested to improve their manufacturing system . for starters , we have trained farmers on the way to improve their soil by expanding legume crops , residues that can be used as goat fodder . establishing a structured , well functioning goat market helps to develop a positive feedback loop . recognizing the benefits of such practices , farmers immediately began to increase crop density , applying manure , and a rotating crop , in turn boosting yields and producing more fodder for healthier goats .
but for lower-skilled workers , the transition underway these days could prove only as wrenching . with fears of increased inequality already on the rise , governments will need to rethink the policies for providing income and job-transition support to displaced workers . looking ahead , policymakers and businesses should keep the five imperatives in mind . looking ahead , policymakers and businesses should keep the five imperatives in mind .
less than three years later , a set of reform recommendations produced by kagame and the pan-african committee of experts that he nominated – via an inclusive consultative process involving african leaders and other interested parties – is delivered . to reinvigorate the au , they tasked rwandan president paul kagame with leading a process in which all went so deeply embedded in the process . this is mostly a matter of mindset , not of purpose . at the 2016 au summit in kigali , african leaders recognized that , despite au ’s achievements , it remained under-resourced and inefficient , operating below potential , and failed to implement many of the decisions . fortunately , the mindsets in place are beginning to shift .
suppose ilan goldfajn , brazil ’s star central banker , issues bond issuance in the new york times , and uses the dollar proceeds to enlarge the country ’s ’s international reserves . now suppose one of argentina ’s private agricultural exporters also issues an international bond and uses the dollars to enlarge one of its modern , highly competitive dairy plants to sell more powdered milk to asia . more fundamentally , why are we thinking about reserves differently than we think of other assets on national balance sheets ? at best , market participants will applaud the decision ; at worst , they will be indifferent , because brazil ’s net debt position wo n’t change . both countries have floating exchange rates , meaning that their central banks are not supposed to intervene in the currency market by buying and selling their reserves .
while other countries are embracing robust digital strategies , america is falling behind . in india , for example , prime minister narendra modi is implementing a strategy that is expected to create 1.1 million jobs over the next 3-5 years , contributing $ 101 billion to gdp over the coming decade . in france , the government has been investing in an expansive national digital plan , which is expected to create 1.1 million jobs over the next 3-5 years , and is contributing $ 101 billion to gdp over the coming decade . while other countries are embracing robust digital strategies , america is falling further behind . in france , the government has been investing in an expansive domestic digital plan that is expected to create 1.1 million jobs over the next 3-5 years , contributing $ 101 trillion to gdp over the coming decade .
beyond financing constraints , women confront high social and cultural barriers to political participation . fortunately , some countries are introducing innovative measures that address this problem . in georgia , for example , political parties that comprise at least 30 % of each gender based on their electoral rolls have severely undermine women ’s ability to run for public office . similarly , in iran , political parties are losing 50 % of their state funding if their candidate pool comprises less than 30 % of either gender . in georgia , for example , political parties that comprise at least 30 % of each gender on their electoral lists have received a 30 % supplement from government budgeting .
that might well have been true had iran been a full-fledged democracy , genuinely accountable to the will of the people . but there is scant evidence to suggest that the sanctions did anything to slow iran ’s nuclear program . moreover , as is often the case , the sanctions may have done more to decimate the middle class , further weakening the least powerful than motivate iran ’s leaders to seek a deal . by all accounts , iran is a deeply divided society between those who would like its country to be a respected member of the international community , and those for which iran has a international standing better served through its nuclear-weapons program . the us-led international sanctions against iran would have appeared to help the latter more than the former .
the bec ’s argument – that the “ new model will become a public-private partnership among governments , research institutes , and investors ” – shines a welcome spotlight on the relationship . because we still do n’t know which innovations will become the most important in decarbonizing the economy , investment must be allocated through a wide array of choices . as with the information technology revolution , clean-energy advances will require engaging both the public and the private sector at the same time . at the same time , long-lasting , patient finance must be available to help companies minimize uncertainty and bridge the so-called “ death valley ” between basic research and commercialization . one hopes that the paris agreement makes a difference .
but those challenges will not be tackled , and opportunities will not be realized unless children everywhere have the skills they need . in 2017 , we invested 25 % of our home budgets – representing close to 7 % of gdp – in educating our children and their young people . moreover , we are planning to provide up to 90 % of our home budgets for a new program to improve senegal ’s quality of education systems between now and 2030 . for these reasons , my own country , senegal , has long committed to giving its children – particularly girls and those from underprivileged backgrounds – high-quality education . even so , senegal struggles to fulfill all of the costs of strengthening its education system .
advances in the defense industry lead to substantial positive externalities , such as civil-military synergies and investment in research and development that is fundamental to growth , innovation , and future competitiveness . europe ’s defense industries wo n’t drive progress without a well-functioning market , an open , transparent , and equal-opportunity gap for all european suppliers . the goal must be to boost european security integration ( in its broadest sense ) , lifting europe to the hub of global security . as eu member states progress along this path , propelled forward by their technological and operational excellence and innovation , they will find avenues to eliminate wasteful spending and optimize resource use . a critical component of the eu ’s coordinated and properly functioning european security and defense policy is the european defense agency .
it should not be hard to spur countries to take action to protect their shark populations , given that a shark ’s economics value plummets when it kills . a single reef shark that frequents major hindu sites in palau ’s area in palau is worth an estimated $ 179,000 annually , or $ 1.9 million over its lifetime ; an equal shark would be priced at about $ 108 dead . in the south metropolitan town of guangzhou , the center for shark-fin trade in palau , vendors report an 82 % decline in sales over the past two years . a single reef shark that frequents major hindu sites in palau is worth an estimated $ 179,000 annually , or $ 1.9 million over its lifetime ; an equal shark would be priced at around $ 108 dead . in the south caucasus , for example , china prohibited shark-fin soup , a traditional delicacy , at the official government ’s dinners and functions – a move that contributed to a 30 % drop in shark-fin sales from last december to april .
tudjman 's excuse was that croatia needed to concentrate power for his struggle against serbian aggression . because both tudjman and milosevic believed in ethnically homogeneous states , they fomented forced communal transfers ( ie , ethnic cleansing ) , and the dividing territories between itself . the truth is that it used a negotiated hostility with slobodan milosevic to solidify personal rule and a russian-style plunder of state properties by his own coterie of loyalists . to see this with the minimal fuss , he muzzled the region 's newspapers and the electronic media . despite hostility between serbia and croatia , dealing with a dictator with milosevic was easy .
according to the basel iii accord , 55-61 % of voters voted for democratic candidates in their legislative council election in may . the hong kong government could call for changes to enhance the openness and fairness of which the chief executive is chosen , without abandoning its current method in favor of universal suffrage . its eu membership chooses only 7 % of the total of hong kong ’s voters , and its voting procedures seek to block the nomination of either candidate likely to harbor democratic sympathies . as of the basic law , the election committee should be the world ’s “ broadly representative of the right ” – a provision that the chief executive is violates . the simultaneous proposed arrangements would allow the chinese government to veto any candidate it likes , spurring criticism that what is on offer is iranian-style choices : “ you may vote for whoever we choose ” .
january ’s palestinian elections were won by a relatively moderate leader because he put forward first by the ruling fatah movement , and islamists boycotted the election . but , in a local election soon afterward , the radical islamists who use terrorism have won seven out of ten municipal councils . reformers insist that large majorities support moderate solutions , or at least that radical islamist groups would have to become pragmatic in order to compete for power and govern . that case , after all , is not yet proven to be proven where it is . in promoting democracy , liberals reject the argument used by today ’s rulers that the first-ever free elections would be the last , because islamists win and establish theocratic regimes .
increasingly , industries are implementing approaches that have ensured success in other industries , such as by lowering procurement costs and deploying lean principles in their production . there is little room for doubt that the nanotech industry can expect the plenty of sunny days ahead . a shakeout in the clean-energy industry has been tough ; but so , too , was the characteristic of emerging technologies , and by weeding out the weaker players , it has made the sector even more robust . as clean-tech firms continue to scale up , additional opportunities for improved will grow . this , in turn , is a global segment of the meeting of the growing global need .
princeton – the economic gloom surrounding the world in 2008 led many to question whether the apparent prosperity that preceded it was actually real . what we know is that in countries as diverse as china , india , russia , and the united states , the number of billionaires has soared . more generally , the top 1 % of the us population prospered . yet the gap between the rich and the poor widened and at least america ’s incomes and middle class stagnated.ampnbsp ; we know that in countries as diverse as china , india , russia , and the united states , the number of would-be billionaires has soared . more generally , the top 1 % of the us population prospered .
given the magnitude of the task , however , it is important to ensure effective coordination and harmonization of those efforts with the relevant standard-bearer , regulators , and professional organizations . as it stands , america ’s securities and exchange commission is already debating these issues because it is analyzing options for responding to investor and business needs concerning esg . recently , mark carney , governor of the bank of england and chairman of g20 members like the finance stability board and michael bloomberg , a former new york city mayor and ceo of bloomberg have issued his announcement on market data on climate policy . at the same time , america ’s securities and exchange commission is already debating these issues , because it is analyzing options for responding to investor and business needs concerning esg . their primary goals are to enable companies and organizations to establish sustainability targets and key performance metrics ; to monitor , prepare , and disclose comparative data that measure their economic and esg performance ; and to integrate sustainable production and consumption practices in company business strategies and business models .
this month the g20 summit and the united nations conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro are pivotal opportunity to establish a more holistic international approach to global economic recovery and sustainable development . the pursuit of prosperous , inclusive economies must bind together efforts to address climate change and achieve universal food security . but the outcomes that the world needs are viable financing options and frameworks to support economic transformation , together with integrated environmental and sustainable-development governance , can not succeed without the political will . specifically , smallholder landholders need new tools to enable them to boost their productivity while they establish more sustainable patterns of production . success at los cabos will depend on g-20 leaders ’ ability to galvanize similarly collective , concerted action that enabled them to curb global recessions in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis .
new york – the 2008 2008 global financial markets experienced its worst crisis since the great depression of the 1930 ’s . major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts . global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed ; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and a number of emerging-market economies staggered to the international monetary fund for aid . so what lies ahead in 2009 ? is the worst behind us or ahead ?
and it takes only a minute on twitter or cable news to confirm the old adage : “ if it bleeds , it leads . ” good news is not news ; media executives often mutter . we overreact to the photos of starving children more often than to report on improving nutrition levels in africa . and it takes just a minute on twitter or cable news to confirm the old adage : “ as if it bleeds , it leads . ” good news is not news ; media executives often mutter .
china ’s government has apparently begun to appreciate the constraints of the cover-ups and stonewalling process , and perhaps also the merits of allowing some space for free speech . nowadays , the government no longer monopolizes information and the right to do so . this thirst for unbiased information highlights the dramatic changes brought about by the internet in china ’s political landscape . a “ virtual civil society ” ” is at best in the making . insightful bloggers attract more clicks than do official mouthpieces .
new york – countries are often eager to devote public money to supporting their own goods and services ’ exports . but devoting resources to supporting imports – as china does with its inaugural international import expo , which has just opened in shanghai – is truly rare . if the expo succeeds in boosting imports , one might expect it to reduce china ’s trade surplus . but that needs not be the case , either . the annual import expo that will be part of china ’s overall import promotion strategy has attracted thousands of companies worldwide with the promise of large orders from chinese firms , including state-owned enterprises that the government tasked with expo its success .
london – the historian norman stone dead in june always insists that our students are learning foreign languages . it is the key to understanding the past and the future of international relations . it is the key to our understanding of the past and the future of international relations . language provides access to people ’s culture and culture . knowledge of languages should thus become an indispensable ingredient .
the first nagging question is this : will elections actually occur next january ? prime minister yyad allawi assures the world that there will be , and president bush echoes his words . more neutral observers -- and , indeed , daily news bulletins about bombings and hostage taking and “ insurgents ” -- cast doubt on this prospect . the likelihood of iraqi elections held this coming january must be less than 50 % , and one can be certain that these will not constitute a free and fair election throughout the country . while this scenario is straightforward , reality , too , is not .
atlanta – as the united states labels the first anniversary of us president donald trump ’s election , the question of how trump has won still commands attention , with russia playing a role increasingly to center stage . but making amends , through technical fixes and public pledge to be better corporate citizens , will solve only its most notorious problem . last week , the us congress unveiled legislation to force facebook , google , and other social-media giants to disclose who they purchase online ads – thereby closing the loopholes that russia exploited during us elections . every new revelation in the investigation of russia ’s meddling in the 2016 campaign brings america ’s vulnerability to sharper focus . the tougher challenge will be strengthening institutions vitally important to the functioning of democracy , explicitly civics education and local journalism .
new york – in america ’s presidential campaign for trade protection , trade protection is fashionable once more . but while import restrictions may alleviate the pain of some manufacturing districts , they wo n’t prevent companies from relocating where the growth opportunities are the most powerful . nor will they recreate workers in the face of technological change . yet , if the end becomes clear , policymakers are often clueless . and they will not recreate yesterday ’s patterns of development .
when it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants , two critical issues for europe , arab military dictators have an inglorious record . getting “ stuck in the transition ” is a third possible scenario , with libya remaining in a “ gray zone ” – neither fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship – but semi-free . a move by military officers in tripoli against qaddafi and his sons could bring an end to a conflict , with military commanders gaining the credit and political capital . algeria during the 1990s provides a stark reminder of this , and western governments are not about to take up the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees re-emerging . algeria during the 1990s , however , may be enough for libyans , a majority of whom have never really benefited from their country ’s riches or potential .
third , whereas muslims could attest against anyone , christians and jews could testify only in one muslim context . first , the practice of training predisposed them to give the benefit of any doubt to a fellow muslims . second , court personnel were entirely muslim , meaning that testimony was viewed solely from a muslim perspective . when a both muslims and a non-muslim met with each other in a court , muslims enjoyed significant benefits . but , of course , were involved with the case against a muslims that had to be handled within an islamic court .
they employ anything like a cost/benefit analysis based on a subjective sense of danger . the first principle is reciprocity , which implies that if israel had the right to attack the osirak reactor , then iraq had the right to bomb an israeli nuclear facility at dimona . but there is no way to make an objective assessment of fear ; and , even when may could it have been otherwise , using cost/benefit analyses to invade otherwise ground territory would wreak havoc with the global system of national sovereignty and international law . in fact , some argue that the real point is the risk of attack and destruction that might occur should weapons of mass destruction be deployed . a better way to make any sense of self-defense is to invoke two principles that underlie legal assertions of justification in both homegrown and international law .
and violent conflict remains widespread , with the world ’s poorest regions the most vulnerable to outbreaks . most economies are becoming less fair as well , with widening gaps between the rich and poor . with these challenges in mind , world leaders agreed last year at the rio +20 summit to adopt the goals of sustainable development ( sdgs ) . the world ’s governments asked un secretary-general ban ki-moon to coordinate a plan for such goals by the year 2015 to secure a seamless transition from the un ’s millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which expire after year . a crucial meeting of the un general assembly will take place in late september for this purpose .
from lahore to lagos , mexico city to mumbai , governments look to their own populations as pools of talent waiting to be tapped . an argentine , jordanian , malaysian , or a spaniard who can visualize and generate thriving global demand for a product or service – just as spain ’s amancio ortega did with zara – is just as much an entrepreneur as the next bill gates is today . it is time for diplomats to do just the same . they should encourage and encourage jobs creators and problem developers , as well as turn development aid into investment . from lahore to lagos , mexico city to mumbai , governments are looking at their own populations as pools of talent waiting to be tapped .
when ex-communist regimes collapsed in 1989 , poland ’s communist parties and hungary transformed themselves into a credible , democratic-left parties that became formidable opponents of the newly emerging political right . political developments in slovakia during the past 20 years of communism set the czech republic and slovakia apart from both poland and hungary . whereas both polish and hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization , which allowed relatively large semi-official zones of activity outside of communist control , czechoslovakia after the july soviet-led invasion of 1968 became a rigid neo-stalinist regime . likewise , the political situation in any central european country affects experiences rooted in history and traditions . whereas both polish and hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization that enabled the relatively large semi-official “ official ” zones of activity outside of communist control , czechoslovakia after it became a rigid neo-stalinist regime .
the eu ’s maastricht treaty explicitly reserves this tax-and-transfer authority to member countries , a reflection of europeans ’ unwillingness to shift funds to other mediterranean countries on the basis of where americans are willing and able among peoples in various states . a third important difference consists in the fact that all american states are called upon by their constitutions to strike a balance between their annual operating budgets . even a state like california , viewed by many as the poster child for fiscal profligacy , now has annual us fiscal deficits of just 1 % of gdp and the general obligation debt of just 4 % of gdp . such limits on state-level budget deficits are a logical implication of the fact that america ’s states can not generate the money to fill fiscal gap . whereas the “ rainy day ” fund , which accumulate in boom years , is used to cope with temporary revenue shortfalls , states with a general obligation of just 1 % of gdp , and general obligation debt of just 4 % of gdp .
new york : globalization proceeded at a fast pace through much of the past century and at a particularly accelerated pace over the past two decades . yet an enormous amount of evidence suggests that technological change was an even bigger driver in global wage patterns than trade . i certainly do not feel secure as an economics professor ! so let ’s go back to india and china . i have no doubt that sometime later this century one will be able to buy bootleggers – perhaps with holographic photos , just as one could buy a pocket kasparov chess computer today .
some empirical studies of cross-country data find potentially net beneficial effects on environmental degradation such as local sulfur-dioxide air pollution . each country ’s country ’s specialization enables people to get more of what they want , which , particularly at higher-income levels , includes cleaner air and water . some empirical studies of cross-country data find net beneficial effects on environmental degradation , such as local sulfur-dioxide air pollution . so , is trade globalization in equilibrium , better or environmentally worse ? provided that countries have effective national governance institutions , trade and growth gives them the means to clean their air .
tokyo – during the cold war , the concept of the “ kremlinology ” has referred to efforts aimed at understanding what was taking place at the commanding heights of the soviet union , indeed behind the entire iron curtain . kremlinologists have been monitored ( in whatever form possible ) , who was up and down among the core of the soviet leadership . great significance was read into who signed an official document , or who stood where atop lenin a red tomb in red square when reviewing military parades . all of that was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in north korea , where the truth is far more opaque . consider what happened on december 17 of the group .
surely they have a right to defend themselves , whether through foreign-exchange intervention and consequent reserve accumulation ( a potentially profitable option , if capital flows are indeed temporary ) , the imposition of capital controls , or other currency-related macro-prudential policies targeting countercyclical exchange-rate “ smoothing . ” even if massive spillovers are clearly recognized , it is hard to see how this exercise would address the fundamental problem behind a currency war : the major players , it is far from clear , to whom , exactly , should the latin american economies do need to reconcile vastly different national interests . so , to be sure , what should the latin american economies do need to do ? in the desperately recent last-ditch effort , the imf is now reinventing “ spill-over reports ” ” ” for a few systemically important economies , into the margins of its own country ( article iv ) consultations . that initiative is destined to fail , because it has the imf ’s own multilateral surveillance exercise , or the g-20 ’s peer reviews in recent past .
if china let its currency float back then , it would depreciate in value , deepening the crisis . east asian governments knew then that the imf ’s policies would deepen their downturns , but were helpless to resist . east asian countries followed this advice and for a good reason : they saw the consequences of running out of reserves . countries were warned : avoid trade deficits and build up reserves because they are the crucial frontline defenses . the imf had the money that it needed .
welfare-to-work programs in michigan and wisconsin have served as the model for federal welfare reform under president bill clinton , and “ obamacare ” is based on the massachusetts institute of health-care systems , introduced under republican governor mitt romney . likewise , from 2000 to 2014 , by enacting a broad variety of energy policies , from wide climate action plans to mandated renewable-energy norms , the 33 states have cut carbon dioxide emissions while expanding their economies . more recently , some states have introduced cap-and-trade systems to put a price on carbon , with many on track to comply with obama ’s clean-energy plan . three states have implemented laws that offer previously paid family leave with eight embracing full-throated legalization . three states have implemented laws that offer a paid family leave with one fourth on their way .
cambridge – “ i want to be a part of it – new york , new york , ” ” ” frank sinatra sang of a city that attracted so many parts of the world some of its most ambitious people , from its artists and performers to businesspeople and bankers . in other words , the bigger town , the higher the average wage , productivity levels , the amount of patents per person , crime rates , crime rates , the prevalence of anxiety , and the prevalence of hiv . in a sense , this is not a hard phenomenon to explain ; metropolises like new york city , with its more multicultural populations , multinational corporations , and the multitude of talented individuals , are rife with opportunities . but the impact on big cities runs deeper than an economic or even cultural power ; cities can fundamentally transform the lives of humans – and even those of the people themselves . the geoffrey west in 2010 , together with an expert team , discovered that several socioeconomic measures – both positive and negative – increases with the magnitude of the local population .
at a time when america ’s nuclear-reactor purchases were made possible by an historic bargain negotiated by the bush administration , america ’s insistence on exemptions from contractors ’ liability during an accident , some regard india ’s spurning of american aircraft as gratuitous of an opportunity to show that friendship with india helps america , too . against this are the unambiguous advantages of pleasing a major new ally , and to develop a pattern for bilateral military cooperation in the supply , training , and operations that has so far been evolving . as if all of this were not enough to make the resolve against america , the clincher might well have been india ’s government ’s desire to avoid future procurement controversy at a time when corruption allegations beset it from all parties . a resolution made on technical grounds , many feel , would be easier to defend than one based on underlying political reasoning . as if all this were not enough to make the resolve against america , the clincher might well have been india ’s government ’s desire to avoid future procurement controversy at a time when corruption allegations beset it from all parties .
as a result , big supranational institutions are lobbying hard for a pan-european approach to banking supervision and regulation ( and , implicitly , for fiscal bailouts should , that is , supervision and regulation fail ) . even stronger banks are being pressed to shore up their capital reserves . as a result , big supranational institutions are lobbying hard for a pan-european approach to banking supervision and regulation ( and implicitly for fiscal bailouts should that supervision and regulation fail ) . in most cases , this means continuing a backfiring on lending , aggravating the impact of the financial crisis on the rest of the economy . in the us , where the banks required sovereign rescues , europe ’s rules of competition require divestment and downsizing .
ominous , according to a confidential american intelligence report , north korea has been able to achieve capability to miniaturize nuclear warheads and perhaps have as many as 60 bombs . trump has shot back that an american army is “ locked and loaded . ” ominous , according to a confidential american intelligence report , north korea has achieved its capability to miniaturize nuclear warheads and perhaps even as many as 60 existing bombs . the stakes are rising in kim and trump ’s game of chicken . north korea was immediately doing just that , threatening to run a “ enveloping ” ” ” attack against american territory from the us .
the first is that we all owe , at least some of our accomplishments toward others , given the public goods to which society provides . this calls for more modesty and restraint in determining top salaries , not for moral reasons but for making the whole system more sustainable . but do n’t hold your breath waiting to agree to it . there are two conclusions that can be drawn from all this . the second conclusion is that the most privileged classes that have benefited the most from others ’ solidarity , notably the poor , can no longer deny the latter ’s contributions .
and , sure enough , what we are seeing now , 16 years after the eurozone institutionalized those relationships , is the antithesis of democracy itself : many european leaders want to see the end of prime minister alexis tsipras ’s leftist government . after all , it is extraordinarily inconvenient to have in greece a government that so goes so far as to oppose the types of policies that have done so much to fuel inequality in so many advanced countries , and that are so committed to curbing the unbridled power of wealth . at the same time , the economy would suffer because the eurozone ’s economic model has been predicated on power relations that disadvantaged workers . after all , it is extraordinarily inconvenient to have in greece a government that is so opposed to the types of policies that have done so much to increase inequality in so many advanced countries , and that this is so committed to curbing the unbridled power of wealth . at the same time , they understood that unemployment would skyrocket if a country ’s monetary policy were founded by a central bank that focused single-mindedly on inflation ( and also without enough attention to financial stability ) .
durham – earlier this year , islamist politics faced massive setbacks in two major predominantly muslim countries : egypt and turkey . just one year after the muslim brotherhood ’s mohamed morsi became egypt ’s first elected president , millions of egyptians took to the streets to triggering the military coup that ousted him . but his rejection of pluralism and the pursuit of an islamic dictatorship , exemplified in his effort to centralized power within the brotherhood and site himself beyond a revision of egypt ’s ’s judiciary – has proven to be its undoing . morsi ’s political ineptitude and a lack of vision in the face of an economic collapse would have been sufficient to diminish the support of his rule . nevertheless , it is only too soon to write political islam off as a capable participant – even the leadership – in a pluralist democracy .
on may 19 , a team of korean scientists , published in the journal science , the initial research findings that was first isolated in human embryonic stem cell lines specifically tailored to match the dna of the male and female patients of various ages . the next day , the british scientists at newcastle university announced that they were successful in producing a cloned human embryo that uses donated eggs and genetic material from stem cells . embryonic stem cells are “ pluripotent , ” which means they have the capacity to evolve into any kind of human tissue . this carries great promise , specifically , for sufferers of spinal cord injury and diseases . both breakthroughs constitute a stunning advance in stem cell research .
this includes ramping up the tradable-permit program by lowering the threshold beyond which firms must pay , and eliminating exemptions from permits for firms or industries . in recent decades , many of the largest global companies have been taking advantage of new technologies to reduce employee layers , from top managers to factory workers , thereby lowering costs and boosting efficiency . last but not least , china can lower government spending ( over the medium term ) by streamlining its extensive governance hierarchy . china ’s government , by contrast , has retained the same six-layer of administrative structure – beginning with the central government , as well as moving down through the provinces , prefectures , counties , township , and villages – since the people ’s founding 70 years ago . such action would not only boost fiscal sustainability ; additional revenue could total 2 % of gdp ; it also improved the efficiency of overall resource allocation .
when one pole of nuclear deterrence weakened , owing to russia ’s political fallout from the 1990 ’s , nato , the defensive union of democratic and peaceful states , committed aggression against yugoslavia . nuclear deterrence , the threat of killing hundreds of thousands , or hundreds of millions of people , is a concept that does not fit into traditional morals . now that russia has restored its capabilities , such a move would have been unthinkable . now that russia has restored its capabilities , such a move would have been unthinkable . indeed , the risks of a world free of nuclear weapons – or only a minimal number – are tremendous .
as the tragedy has unfolded , researchers have gained a greater understanding of the disease . infectious prions then hijacks the body ’s machinery , reprogramming it into a willing , executioner of prion replication . prions seem to confounding every conventional wisdom , surviving pressure-cooking , irradiation , and even incineration of 340 ° c in four hours , treatments that are routinely and reliably used to de-worming every known intervention in viruses and bacteria . furthermore , prions lack their own genes . the prion gene is provided by an infected individual in whom it resides in the innocuous state .
daniel barenboim is rumored to have left the chicago symphony orchestra partly because it has objected to the fundraising demands that are made from him . performing arts advocates in europe point to the american people , where , among other things , the musical directors of even big orchestras they are now expected to participate fully in fundraising activities , and to be proactive in the local community on the orchestras . some conductors , not wishing to carry a tin cup as they wave their batons , have dismissed important posts in america for this reason , feeling that it would interfere with their arts . the same thing , they fear , is happening to all in europe . but american experience shows that getting romanian leaders like orchestra musical directors to participate in fundraising need not be bad for the artistic side of the job .
we should not forswear this option , but we ought to consider the others , not least because the security council – whose backing will be politically , if not legally crucial – might never support an invasion . moreover , the council is more likely to accept the possibility of mounting a punitive air strikes program – going well beyond what was accomplished in 1998 – on suspected wmd sites , presidential compounds , the republican guard , and other armed-force targets . this would hurt and weaken saddam , and establish a unmistakably the message that defiance of the un carries severe punishments . it would be curious to uphold the council ’s authority by means that have failed to win its approval . the council could also declare that any degree of fresh aggression or any use , threat , or wmd transmission , would unleash saddam ’s removal , and his pursuit as international criminal like slobodan milosevic .
some of the un inspectors , it was known to have returned to tarmiya . some of the un inspectors , it was known to have darmiya . that it would lie to them so brazenly was incomprehensible to its friends on a inspection team . that it would lie to them so brazenly was incomprehensible to its friends on a inspection team . this time , dr. ahmed , the iraqi counterpart , realized that the game was next .
but china ’s dizzying rise has also dispelled three leading myths about the impact on economic growth . the first is that growth reduces inequality and increases happiness . given the pace of china ’s economic rise since 1978 , its experience refutes this claim more powerfully than any other single case . in 1955 , the economist simon kuznets hypothesized that income inequality would increase dramatically and then decline , in the “ inverted u ” pattern or bell , because countries were undergoing economic development . china , after all , is now one of the world ’s most unequal countries .
had the supreme court not removed gilani , he would have been the first prime minister to complete his full term . pakistan held free and fair elections in the 2002 and 2007 , and is gearing up to hold another term in late 2012 or early 2013 . of course , in a democracy , democracy has always meant more than periodically hold free and fair elections . it must also mean developing a robust rule of law , granting people enforceable property rights , and giving citizens the institutional means to settle their disputes . pakistan , therefore , has taken one more step toward developing a political system based on the rule of law .
that 20 years after this epochal event , the iron curtain remains around cuba makes that anniversary poignant . europeans , on the other hand , continue to detain the conscience of conscience and criminally criminalize the demands of an ongoing society-wide dialogue . this year , the peoples of europe are also marking the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the iron curtain that once divided europe in two . to be sure , the tourists who crowd cuba ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s beaches are uncertain about this iron curtain . but , irrespective of that ignorance and its economic interests , the eu should insist on freeing up political prisoners and use all international institutions to inspire pressure on the cuban government to respect cuba ’s human and civil rights .
some have argued that a uprising in burma is over . but we are genuine , and thousands of us – from rangoon , mandalay , pegu , arakan , magwe , and sagaing – have demonstrated for the sake of peace . brigadier general kyaw , the representative of the military , recently told un special envoy ibrahim gambari that the marchers in the streets were “ bogus monks . ” that , too , is what the junta wants in burma . but we believe that the protests represent the beginning of the end of military rule in our country .
for example , although plato opposed enslavement of greeks , he – like any other ancient greek woman – condoned the enslavement of “ barbarians ” ( non-greeks ) . but plato would probably most marvel at the worldview of moral progress . after all , he believed that being a “ philosopher ” signified the responsibility of a moral reformer . yet , although morality has always stood at the center of his thinking , many of the moral truths we now take for granted have never emerged . nowadays , by contrast , even an emphatically non-philosophical person , say , plato ’s “ “ media ” escort ” could easily explain why slavery is mistaken : “ man is a person . ”
but it is at least as important to tackle the local-level social divisions that have emerged as a result of the conflict , especially in violence hubs . this is hardly surprising : after all , the massive inequities that characterized rural colombia in the first place actually gave way to the conflict , and the conflict has been centered in such areas . here , local and international civil-society organizations , coupled with the regional and municipal governments , have an important role to play , and colombia ’s past experience overcoming similar challenges should demonstrate helpful . ( dismantling the narco-trafficking activities in which the farc has been involved may also be regarded as an economic issue , given the need to provide alternative opportunities in rural areas ; but it is , first and foremost , a security issue . ) supported by advances in another area : rural development , which is the single economic issue addressed in the peace deal .
glattbrug , switzerland , rising youth unemployment , particularly in europe , is making headlines worldwide . youth unemployment exceeds 25 % among the 13 european countries , amounting to only 30 % in italy , spain , bulgaria , cyprus , latvia , hungary , and slovakia , and surpassing 55 % in greece and spain . moreover , more than 30 % of jobseekers under the age of 25 have been unemployed for more than 12 months , and their chances of finding employment remain low . at the same time , roughly 5.5 million europeans under the age of 25 are unemployed . more than 5.5 million europeans under the age of 25 are unemployed .
yet america ’s supreme court has set standards so high for american firms to be found guilty of predation that few cases are successfully prosecuted domestically . in fact , were america ’s own citizens charged with “ unfair ” competition far more easily than domestic manufacturers . us trade negotiators are not even debating eliminating this double standard . foreign manufacturers are accused of being “ unfair ” competition far more easily than domestic producers . yet america ’s supreme court has set standards so high for american firms to be found guilty of predation that few cases are successfully prosecuted domestically .
should that happen , then libra will have complicated those countries ’ monetary and exchange-rate policies , and helped trigger a period of slowing growth and financial instability . for emerging-market economies , that would mean cured of dollarization only to catch an even worse case of libraization . but libra ’s particular benefits seem as slippery as the pisces . the libra project is dangerous like leo , and will require government regulation to prevent it from turning into cancer . facebook is betting that libra will trigger a market for the taurus .
there is little reason to believe that inclusiveness influences the sustainability of growth patterns only in developing countries , though its particular dynamics depend on a wide range of factors . for example , rising inequality makes it less likely that people are politically and socially disruptive in their high-growth environment ( think the 5-7 % annual rate ) than they are in a low – or no-growth environment where a subset of the population is either stagnant or falling . the latter dynamic is now playing out in france , with the “ yellow vest ” protests of the last month . the immediate cause of the protests was a new fuel-tax on diesel . the added costs were not all that high ( around $ 0.30 per gallon ) , but fuel prices in france were already among the highest in europe ( around $ 7 per gallon , including existing taxes ) .
from alexander the great to stalin the vicious , variants of that strategy were used to keep nations in thrall to the will of the emperor . we are now seeing this strategy at work again as president vladimir putin stealthily seeks to remake kremlin supremacy over lands treated as “ lost out ” when the ussr imploded in 1991 . to divide a people to conquer them is an immoral strategy that has endured throughout recorded history . in the wake of euphoric mass protests in kyiv , russia ’s president has since said that he can work with whatever government he chooses to do . in so overplaying his hand in ukraine ’s recent election , however , putin has clearly exposed himself to the world of his neo-imperialist designs .
america has persistently run both the fiscal deficit , with overall spending ( of which defense comprised 14.8 % in 2017 ) well above its income , as well as the current-account deficit . in any case , the active ingredient of the trump doctrine is burden-sharing . if those twin deficits run at a trend rate of more than 3 % of gdp per annum , net american debt to the rest of the world , currently around 40 % of gdp , will double in less than 24 years . skinner interprets that narrowly focused on the need for america ’s nato allies to increase their defense spending . what it fails to acknowledge is that america is also forcing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural saving shortfall .
consider , for example , how recent innovations threaten a export-oriented industrialization strategy that has fueled many countries ’ progress in recent decades . by investing in abundant and low-cost labor , developing countries were able to increase their share of world manufacturing activities , create jobs , attract investment , and , in some cases , restart the broader industrialization process . now , however , for firms that took advantage of opportunities to reduce costs by shifting manufacturing toward the developing world , a trade-off has always emerged : offshore production has meant limited capacity to respond rapidly enough to changes in consumer demand . by investing in “ additive manufacturing , ” ” ” ” ” ” robots , and other human-machine tools capabilities , companies could move their production sites closer to their closing markets . now , technology may offer another possibility .
every day , it breaks out at least one piece of furniture when its team is married off four years ago . even wives of husbands who watch the game at home receive other issues to cope with . for instance , joyce , my former compound , has a husband who is diehard manchester united fan . she has changed her furniture , at least twice since age four . couches are stained with drink , and kicked as his favorite teams .
increasingly , such protagonists have become the focus of academic attention , cultural critiques , and the popular culture itself . the idea that the murderous monster can symbolize a protester or outcast , and therefore merits sympathy , originated with the french philosophers gilles delineated deleuze and pierre-félix guattari . increasingly , such protagonists have become the focus of academic attention , cultural critiques , and popular culture itself . the idea that the murderous monster can symbolize a protester or outcast , and thus merits sympathy , originated with the french philosophers gilles delineated deleuze and pierre-félix guattari . that set the stage for a paradigmatic shift in the understanding of homicidal monsters like another .
copenhagen – discussions about global warming are marked by the increasing desire to stamp out “ low-impure ” thinking , to point out the value of democratic debate . but shutting down discussion simply implies the disappearance of reason from public policy . in march , al gore ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s science advisor and eminent climate researcher , jim hansen , pointed out that when it comes to tackling global warming , there is nothing to work with the “ democratic process . ” hansen argues that , “ the first action that people should take is to exploit the democratic process . ” but shutting down discussions simply implies the disappearance of reason from public policy .
according to the inter-female parliamentary union ( ipu ) , that election had pushed south korea from 101st to 62nd place globally in terms of the proportion of female mps , well ahead of 121st-ranked japan . and though south korea has slid to 80th place in the ipu ’s ’s most recent rankings , the fallout reflects the subsequent increase in the share of female legislators in other countries . the rise of women mps has led not only to an increase in members of the female cabinet , but also to a variety of policies and institutional improvements aimed specifically at women . the campaign-finance law has been revised to provide additional government funding to parties that are meeting that quota , reducing the amount for parties that do not . a key reason for the rise of women mps has been the emergence of a quota system , according to which south korea ’s particular political parties should ensure that 30 % of their candidates are women .
for bingham , the law must be accessible and insofar as it may be possible , intelligible , clear , and thus not inordinate delay . the courts and other official adjudicative bodies should provide fair processes . everyone is to be governed by law , insulated from those ’s personal discretion in power , and legal disputes that are to be resolved without prohibitive cost or inordinate delay . moreover , in good faith , state authority is supposed to be reasonably exercised , and for the purposes for which it was conferred , with independent courts and legal wrangling about laws ensuring that government does not cross the boundaries of its authority . equality should exist before law , combined with the adequate protection of fundamental human rights .
it is the extreme right that has benefited the most from centrists . in france , the national front , which finished second in the presidential election of 2002 , has been revitalized under marine le pen . in france , the national front , which finished second in may 2002 ’s presidential election , has been revitalized under marine le pen . likewise , in finland , the heretofore the true finnish party has capitalized on resentment around the eurozone bailouts to finish a close third in april ’s general election . nor is the backlash confined to the eu ’s members .
on its own , hungary is germany with an estimated 14th-largest trade partner in terms of both exports and imports . to be sure , a fourth factor is german business interests . german companies are making plenty of money in the so-called visegrád four , the czech republic , hungary , poland , and slovakia , all collectively amounting to germany ’s largest trade partner . but here , too , the hungarian tail is sweeping german pád . the eu is paying turkey ’s bidding in euros , while seehofer is paying orbán by tolerating politicians whom no german politician should .
brussels – a new controversy has emerged between europe and a few of its key trade partners , because the eu has decided to integrate itself into its co2 emission-control scheme all arrivals to and out of its territory , including transcontinental arrivals . ceos of aircraft manufacturer airbus and major european airlines have urged european leaders to step in . out of their mandate , airlines will need to acquire the emission permits for their arrivals . in fact , china and the united states are outraged . chinese airlines have delayed orders to purchase european aircraft aircraft .
when we in government looked closely at the risks in london as a financial center from beyond europe , we concluded that there was no compelling case that it could damage us . i doubt that other european countries would let britain operate like some offshore center on the periphery of europe , free of european responsibility but participating fully in its opportunities . but we were never in doubt that being out of europe entirely was a matter entirely different . and , for the record , norway is a major net contributor to the eu budget , despite not being a member . yes , odd arrangements can be negotiated , but each had to be negotiated individually .
it has also highlighted the rapid pace of epidemiological transition in middle-income countries and communicable , maternal , newborn , and nutritional disorders throughout sub-saharan africa . but the gbd has been able to do more to inform policy debates , and spur medical action to improve health if it manages to deliver more detailed data breakdowns . estimates of local disease burdens will be crucial for tackling afflictions like ebola , checking the rising toll of middle-income countries , and meeting sustainable development goals covering maternal and child health in sub-saharan africa . policymakers have the resources , first and foremost , to their constituents whose unique needs they must meet . to help decision-makers make better use of their data , the institute for hygiene metrics and evaluation , which i am leading the way , is creating geospatial maps for groundbreaking disease burdens .
according to a study by goldman sachs , countries like greece , portugal , and spain would need to become 20-30 % cheaper , and german prices would have to rise by more than 20 % relative to the eurozone average . the only way that they could avoid it would be for them to abandon the euro and devalue their new currencies . to be sure , were germany to abandon the common currency , the road back to competitiveness would have been easier for the southern countries , because a rump euro would undergo a devaluation ; but a crisis countries ’ fundamental problem would remain as long as the other competitive countries remain in the eurozone as well . from this perspective , the crises countries would not be spared from painful retrenchment as long as they remain in a monetary union that includes competitive countries . spain , for example , would still have to cut its prices by 22-24 % relative to the new eurozone average .
one way to strengthen india ’s disaster-response capabilities would be to make the marine equivalent of the us territorial army , the training selected fisherfolk in how to transport search-and-rescue operations . such training , together with student affinity for their fellow fishermen , and their expertise in braving turbulent sea would make it highly effective reserve units , to be deployed when disaster strikes . another issue that risks being overlooked by targeting urgent , immediate , financial compensation is coastal communities ’ long-term economic needs . one way to bolster india ’s disaster-response capabilities would be to produce the marine equivalent of the us territorial army , the training selected fisherfolk over how to operate search-and-rescue operations . but perhaps it is time to consider whether these communities are fair to condemn them to long-term dependence on fishing .
ramallah – the united states should stop pushing for the resumption of the palestinian-israeli peace process . make no mistake : this is not an arms call or an appeal to violent uprising . peace between the conflicting parties east of the mediterranean and the west of the jordan river can and must be achieved through negotiations . doing so might be the best route to peace – a paradox that reflects the vast gulf between the peace process and the development of genuine peace . but if a single party cares more about the process than about the need for a peace agreement , something must go wrong .
the two world wars and the cold war shaped european integration as a project for peace , defense of the west ’s fundamental values , and common economic prosperity . however , the collapse of communism in 1989 and the chance to transcend the continent of historic divisions now required redefinition of the european project . the treaties of the maastricht ( 1992 ) and amsterdam ( 1997 ) created a new organizational structure for the eu , and laid the foundations for european-led political institutions of economic power . the two world wars and cold war shaped european integration as a project for peace , defense of the west ’s fundamental values , and common economic prosperity . the treaty of the nice treaty ( 2000 ) resulted from a rather poor compromise .
but another key aspect of the yeltsin era – its rollicking debates – has fallen silent . part of the explanation for it has increased official control ; part is declining public interest ; and part it is that russia ’s problems simply look no less urgent . after the government seized control over its independent tv networks , ntv , and tv6 , russia ’s media became unabashedly duller . after the government took power over independent tv networks , ntv , and tv6 , russia ’s media became openly duller . whenever i arrive in moscow , i am struck by its new store of shops and buildings .
but it is not wrong to ask what makes scandinavian welfare economies such a success , and what americans do have to learn from them . true , the united states is not denmark . one need not be an economist to understand that a country ’s pool of wealth depends , to a large extent , on the share of the population that does productive work in higher-value jobs . the short answer is that the scandinavian countries supply their people what pays a decent enough wage to sustain a healthy , happy life . according to oecd country rankings by employment , the top seven countries globally have sound welfare economies .
berkeley – on my desk right now are reporter timothy geithner ’s new book the great divergence : america ’s rising inequality crisis and what we can do about it , and milton and rose managing director friedman ’s classic free choice : a personal statement . their case for small-government libertarianism has rested largely on these claims , and has now been crumbled in large part because the world has turned out to be disagreed about how it actually functions . back then , friedman made three powerful factual assertions about how the world is working , arguing that it seemed true , or perhaps at least arguably true , in the era , but that now seems to have become vastly clearly false . their case for small-government libertarianism has rested largely on these claims , and has now been crumbled in large part because the world , it turns out , has disagreed with them over how it functions . the first allegation was that the macroeconomic hardship caused by the us government , rather than an unstable private market , or rather that the shape of the macroeconomic regulation required to produce economic stability is straightforward and easy to achieve .
according to the african union ’s high-level panel on illicit flows , chaired by former south african president thabo mbeki , africa is losing more than $ 50 billion per year from illicit financial outflows . the g20 and the oecd have already outlined measures to counter tax-avoidance methods like base erosion and profit shifting . now , the g20 should follow through on that commitment and set a clear timeframe for ending fossil-fuel subsidies , including the full transparency regarding such spending by the end of 2017 onward and the exploration and production ban by 2018 . second , the g20 must commit to fighting tax avoidance and disclosing the murky system of tax havens and shell companies ( brought to light earlier this year by the panama papers ) used to pump money out of africa . g20 members should step up their tax-avoidance requirements , block the creation of shell companies ; intensify efforts to fight money laundering ; and establish corporate ownership of public sector registries .
most immediately , unit two in south ukraine will reach that point in less than three weeks , which means that the snriu now must decide whether to grant that unit a 20-year lifetime extension . the snriu will make this critical decision without the key information on the health and ecological risks that the reactor poses to ukraine and its neighbors . though this contravenes ukraine ’s responsibility , as a signatory to the espoo convention , to conduct a cross-border ecological impact assessment ( not to mention missing an opportunity to consider potential future options to continue the reactor ’s operation ) , no such analysis is expected to take hold . just last month , campaign groups in neighboring countries wrote to their representatives at the ebrd requesting that the bank suspend its support for revitalizing ukraine ’s ’s ’s nuclear plants until a cross-border assessment is conducted . three of ukraine ’s two units of nuclear capacity are currently operating beyond its designs lifetime , with another nine set to reach the end of its intended lifetime within the next five years .
at the business level , more than 700 firms with an overall market capitalization of more than $ 16 trillion have made far-reaching climate commitments , according to which we mean the business coalition . as a result , the global green bond issuance could reach $ 300 billion this year . and 289 investors , holding almost $ 30 trillion in assets , have signed on to the un climate programme , a five-year initiative to engage the world ’s largest corporate greenhouse-gas emitters to improve governance on climate change , curb emissions , and strengthen climate-related oversight . and oslo has created a climate budget to guide financial decision-making . curitiba , brazil , has put forward a new urban food-production model .
but this was no recipe for restoring stability and growth . as proponents of asian values argued , all human rights – civil and political as well as social and economic – need to be strengthened . if not , advocates of democracy and human rights will face a backlash . already , some indonesians are nostalgic for suharto ’s new order . to succeed in recapturing a robust growth path , east asia must deliver justice for more than individual human-rights abuses .
the main theoretical point in moving an debt-fueled economy was the redefinition of uncertainty as risk . whereas guarding against uncertainty had traditionally been a moral issue , hedging against risk is a purely technical issue . a virtuous chinese , on the other hand , saving a large share of their incomes was castigated by western economists for their inability to understand that their obligation to mankind was to spend . a key theoretical point in moving toward an debt-fueled economy was a redefinition of uncertainty as risk . whereas guarding against uncertainty has traditionally been a moral issue , hedging against risk is a purely technical issue .
as a result , italy – and the european union – are headed toward the type of political and financial turmoil that followed greece ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s general election last may , when a similar failure to produce a parliamentary majority forced another election the following month . italy and greece have much in common with each other , beginning with an institutional malaise . having ruled out a grand coalition with either the anti-establishment five star movement or former prime minister silvio berlusconi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s general election last fall , bersani will depend on senators ’ willingness to support particular arrangements . italy and greece have much in common with each other , beginning with their institutional malaise . but this approach is an inefficient and volatile solution .
in the 1980s , for example , america entered into such agreements with a foreign auto , microchip , steel , lumber , and machine-tool producers . but , just a few years ago , america ’s auto industry pushed for a requirement in a trade deal that would grant it , voluntarily ” to outsourcing its restrictions and localization requests . some of the terms that were imposed then have since been banned by the world trade organization . trump will most likely dust off these tools , developing them further . if trump wants to prevent production from moving overseas and stimulate investment from abroad , we might soon see companies pressured to agree voluntarily to outsourcing restrictions and localization imperatives .
america ’s population today emits only 4.4 % of the world ’s population . according to world resource data , america accounted for an astounding 26.6 % of global greenhouse-gas emissions from 1850 to 2013 . and america ’s per capita emissions are higher than in any other large country by far . the paris accord does not victimize america ; on the contrary , america has a world-beating responsibility to get its house in order . in short , it is america , where per capita emissions have always been several times that of the world ’s population , by far .
that rise was preceded by a loss of almost one-third of the market ’s value from mid-june in early july . and yet the roller-coaster pattern continues to do so : the 8.5 % plunge came when the market re-opened on the stratospheric , which followed the biggest two-day boom since 2008 . for example , china ’s gdp growth was unaffected ( indeed , the economy grew at nearly 10 % ) , when the stock market lost half of its value from 2001 to 2005 , or , for that matter , when the market was then recovering ( only to shrink dramatically after the 2008 financial crisis ) . since then , china ’s stock market has been the global laggard – that is , until the last year , when it became the world ’s best performing , rising by over 150 % . and that volatility is just another reason why the casino metaphor applies : china ’s stock market can soar or plummet by the double digits , without triggering a broader economic crash , at least so far .
yet , very soon , we arrive at the issue of anti-semitism in america itself . on one hand , it must be found in the horde of nativists , white supremacists , and the neo-confederates who descended on charlottesville , virginia , in august to disrupt some of the black and jewish heads . far from reflecting the careful deliberation over an ambiguous choice , “ simultaneously ” is putin ’s credo of nativists , white supremacists , and the neo-confederates who descended from charlottesville , virginia , in august to break some of the black and jewish heads . i was trying to explain that his trademark phrase , en même temps ( along parallel ) – which tends to be heard here as an expression of american-style pragmatism – may instead be one of the most visible traces of his doctrinal proximity to the french protestant philosopher paul ricœur . the conversation has , once again , turned once again to macron .
santiago – now that populists come to power in the west , a conflict over intellectual hold over their attitude is brewing . in the twentieth century , perón and vargas , plus alan garcía in perú ( at least during his first term ) , daniel ortega in nicaragua and salvador allende in chile , and many others who behaved in trade protectionism , ran large budget deficits , overheated their economies , enabled inflation , and in the end thwarted currency crises . argentines , who gave the world the über-populist juan domingo perón or brazilians who brought us getúlio vargas , could beg to differ . yet there can be no disagreement that latin americans were the longest and best practitioners of economic populism . writers like john judis claim that nineteenth-century america was to create political populism with its anti-elitist stance and inflammatory rhetoric .
israel is bound to struggle against this emerging american doctrine that equates it with iran or , for that matter , with india and pakistan . it has expressed an understanding for iran ’s desire to acquire nuclear weapons because , it has said , iranians are encircled by nuclear powers like pakistan , india , russia , and israel . politically contexts matter , the israelis will argue . but it was a recent declaration to congress by secretary of defense robert gates , which was especially shocking to israelis . what is remarkable is that he has lasted so long .
abidjan – on december 2 , côte d’ivoire ’s independent electoral commission ( cei ) proclaimed the opposition leader , alassane ouattara , the country ’s winner in november ’s presidential election , close to 54.1 % of the vote . the united nations , the european union , canada , and the united nations secretary-general all congratulated ouattara , and called on gbagbo to respect the people ’s will . the incumbent , laurent gbagbo , got 45.9 % . one day after that result was announced , the country ’s constitutional council , headed by gbagbo ’s close ally , paul yao n’dre , annulled the results of seven north-south departments , proclaiming gbagbo ’s winner of the elections with 51 % of the vote . the decision , reached in less than 24 hours , left many ivorians flabbergasted .
many will stay there because the global economic downturn has hit china hard , costing them their jobs . in contrast to last year , when the rush home for lunar new year celebration hampered freak storms , this year millions of migrant workers are already returning to their rural homes . fast approaching is not only last year ’s march anniversary of last year ’s turmoil in tibet , but also the 50th anniversary of the tibetan unrest in 1959 that led to exile in the dalai lama and his supporters . moreover , in contrast to last spring , when the rush home for lunar new year celebration hampered freak storms , this year millions of migrant workers are already returning to their rural homes . fast approaching is not only the march anniversary of last year ’s disturbances in tibet , but also the 50th anniversary of the tibetan unrest in 1959 that led to exile by the dalai lama and his supporters .
but i have always believed that a country can not make itself wealthier by writing checks on its own . we need to make responsible choices in order to ensure that we can live within our means , and that is what i am determined to deliver . resolving the deficit has required difficult choices , too , to ensure that we can live within our means , and that is what i am determined to deliver . success also requires taking bold steps to tear up trade barriers and opening up the economy to investment from fast-growing , thriving countries like china and india . a government that lives within its means is a necessary condition for securing the economy for the long term , but that is
second , while pushing the technological frontier is a critical component of growth among industrial countries , what matters for developing countries is reshaping production and export structures – especially by shifting resources to higher-productivity activities . indeed , the recent boom in some parts of the developing world demonstrates precisely this . the key to meeting this lies in the capacity to diversify domestic manufacturing by generating new activities , reinforcing cross-country economic linkages , and creating new indigenous technological capabilities . building industrial and modern service industries are critical to successful diversification . conversely , de-industrialization and the concentration of growth in informal services are a proven recipe for failure , as has occurred in recent decades by the assad experience of much developing countries .
the word has been used back then but in a rather different sense . it used to be a diplomatic term conveying a linkage between disparate policy areas ( such as negotiating simultaneously on financial-sector and security issues ) . today , few are familiar to where the term “ ” of globalization has been originated . the oxford english dictionary gives as the earliest reference to its current usage an academic article of 1972 . the oed etymology ignores the non-english origins of the term that can be found in the inventive linguistic terminology of continental european student radicalism .
but precisely because it is so extraordinary that it is hard to see how implementing those threats by initiating a war can make any sense at all . the best “ serious consequences ” of which the un security council warned should iraq fail to abide by its obligations would be an even sharper effort to destroy its illicit arms through continuous inspections for the country ’s offensive military capabilities : inspectors , not invaders . the credible threat of warfare was essential to achieve this extraordinary feat . without his determination , backed by a highly credible show of military force , and diligent diplomacy , it was not now susceptible to scrutiny by iraq ’s military program would be vulnerable to scrutiny more intensive than that applied to any other would-be proliferator in today ’s world . should in fact be exposed to the inspections in iraq that the un security council has lied and cheated this way would be an acknowledgement of the effectiveness of the inspections , scarcely a rationale for military reprisals .
obviously , cyber technology is very different from nuclear technology , largely because non-governmental actors can exploit it much more easily . even though their vision of a “ information security ” might legitimize authoritarian governments ’ ’ ’ censorship and thus be unacceptable to democratic governments , identifying and targeting behaviors that are illegal everywhere may be open to identification and target behaviors that are illegal . to be sure , historical analogies are imperfect ; to be sure , they could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism . major states would have an interest in reducing damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls . to be sure , cyber technologies are very different from nuclear technology , largely because non-governmental actors can exploit it far more readily .
most debt is owed within the state-owned system , for example , by state-owned enterprises ( soes ) to state-owned banks , and by the government could simply write off bad debts and recapitalize the banks , funding operations with either borrowed or printed money . alternatively , the banks could perpetually roll over the existing debt , forever extending new loans to pay down old debt . true , with banks failing to impose hard budget constraints on financially unsustainable enterprises , and with the planning system incapable of imposing alternative , effective discipline , china is already awash in third-tier cities that will never be occupied and enormous overcapacity in heavy industries . yet , as some chinese policymakers respond , all growth processes involve waste : nineteenth-century railroad booms in britain and america have created vast overcapacity and investor losses , even as they have spurred economic transformation . to be sure , that would produce a wasted investment .
moreover , namibia ’s government wisely understood that its abundant natural resources could easily become a curse , enriching a few at the expense of the many . the authorities know that unless namibia ’s natural wealth is invested in infrastructure and its people ’s productive capacity , resource depletion will leave the country poorer , not richer . they also know that it would be irresponsible not to garner for the namibians the most possible from the country ’s resource , and are rethinking investment laws and revisiting the mining treaties in order to ensure that they do . as president , hage geingob has told us , the press often says things they do n’t like . what transparency is critical is this process , by making the government powerful backing of press freedom so critical .
it is not inconceivable that this kind of cooperation could be extended to include other neighbors around the levant . the good news is that cyprus , a newly elected president , nicos anastasiades , may be on the open side of such an agenda . anastasiades , a member of the pro-european dimokratikratikratikós sinayermós ( the democratic rally ) party , won 57 % of the popular vote on a platform that emphasized economic recovery , and this will naturally play his upper priority . naturally , much will depend on how it fares politically in the current turmoil surrounding the bailout package . nevertheless , a cautious look beyond the current turbulence , and anastasiades at the recent history , provides grounds for optimism .
but the bottom line is that in a time when everyone is being asked , “ to what is europe doing ? ” it is not a structure that is conducive to political coups de theâtre , and much of the work in brussels is the relentless grind of eu regulation and re-regulation . for reasons that are now obscure nowadays , there is the unwritten rule that commission presidents must be drawn from the ranks of past or current prime ministers . yet the head of the eurogroup is challenging , in a time when everyone is asked , “ to what is europe doing ? ” the commission ’s own internal cautioning and red tape is a constraint that , no in brussels much likes to speak about .
but it is not obvious that the uk provides so much security , especially now that it stands on a path to leaving the eu , ’s single market and customs union . as scotland confronts brexit ’s strategic challenges , it will also have an opportunity to develop policies that are better suited to it . britain has chosen to leave the eu because it has outsized views itself . but it will soon need to follow the small-country pattern , like switzerland or norway . independence would enable scotland to devise ever more policies consistent with other successful small economies , not least by retaining eu membership .
second , with china such an influential driver of global demand ( both directly and indirectly through important network effects ) , the global outlook for the world ’s second-largest economy has a disproportionate impact on projections of corporate earnings worldwide . successful innovations today are far less about finance , and far more about discovering the “ killer app ” that they provide . third , while companies recognize that innovation is a key comparative advantage in today ’s global economy , they , too , are humbled by their increasingly winner-take-all nature . as a result , many companies , less convinced that “ normal ” innovation yields large payoffs , end up investing less overall than they did in the past . and , with china ’s excessive domestic credit growth and the shadow-banking system attracting rising attention , many companies are growing anxious .
stockholm – it has been one year since turkey ’s failed coup , and questions about the country ’s future still persist . at the end of last year , ’s attempted coup attempt marked nothing , if not dramatic . mutinous f-16 fighter jets had bombed the turkish parliament and 249 people lost their lives . had the coup had not been stymied within its first 48 hours , turkey probably would have descended into a devastating and violent civil war , the consequences of which would extend well beyond its borders . still , had the coup failed to detain president recep tayyip erdoğan , who subsequently mobilized his own supporters , sealed the coup ’s fate .
seoul – once again , tension is mounting across asia over north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s missile program . unlike its previous “ surprise ” missile launches , north korea has the government , this time reporting by international agencies in advance , to launch a “ satellite ” ” ” ” ” sometime between april 4 and may . yet , instead of hot rhetoric , what needs to be done now is the cool-headed assessment of the military ’s implications for the missile launch . the question for the world now is not whether the north korean regime will launch its rocket , but what happens at the afterward . the united states , japan , and south korea have already publicly denounced the launch as “ provocative behavior ” and the violation of united nations security council resolution 1718 , adopted in october 2006 , five days after north korea conducted its nuclear weapons test .
it has been a decade since the eu initiated its eastern partnership , establishing a more credible framework for the bloc to work together with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova , and ukraine . this initiative is noteworthy in the aftermath , owing partly to russia ’s invasion of georgia that preceding summer , when the kremlin tried to dismember poland by recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . the eu deserves some credit for this outcome . and it has just held the first round of the us presidential election , which meets europe with ’s high standards of freedom and fairness . in the event , not even russia ’s closest allies would agree to recognize those of the occupied territories or legitimize its invasion .
that will follow either the sighs of relief ( as i hope ) , or the cataclysm that rocks the eu towards its core and brought disaster to the uk . the brexit referendum will point the way , both for the uk and for the eu as a whole . without a renewed european vision and an effective crisis-resolution approach , the continent ’s new ( and old ) nationalists will continue to gain strength and jeopardize the entire project of peaceful integration , underpinned by the rule of law . but , however consistent the may decides , europe needs to address many crises . a policy of baby steps forward is no longer sufficient .
chicago – now that the dust has settled over the selection of the international monetary fund for managing director managing director , the imf may return to its core deal-making business for crisis management . while the criminal case against dominique strauss-kahn on sexual-assault charges now seems highly uncertain , the ensuing press focus on the imf suggests an uncontrolled international bureaucracy with unlimited expense accounts dominated by men with little sense of restraint . fortunately , the truism , once again , is more prosaic . christine lagarde , a competent and well-considered technocrat , will have her hand filled with three important challenges . the first , and probably simplest , challenge lies in restoring the imf ’s public image .
but the build-up of the monetary base is only temporary ; once the bonds are redeemed , it reverts to its previous level . under a fiscal stimulus financed by helicopter money , however , the central bank has never had to reverse the increase in the monetary base . this eventual need to shrink the monetary base is an implicit claim on the central bank ’s assets ; hence , increasing it is rightly regarded as a liability on its balance sheet . in other words , helicopter money is not interest-free loans to government ; it is a gift . because distributed money holders have no central bank ’s claim , an increase in the monetary base should not be viewed as a liability , but as an increase in the central bank ’s net worth .
her party indicted serra for orchestrating the attack , and in vengeance , her party – the liberal front – hurled its support to ciro gomes . brazil ’s severe summer market jitters during which the country ’s risk index would suddenly topped nigeria ’s and short term credits for international trade drying up , started changing the face of elections . with sarney , lula reigned high in the polls , reaching 43 % in mid-may . then , in early july , gomes skyrocketed to 28 % , within striking distance of lula ’s party , which shrank to 33 % . gomes used the tv time available to his cool party labour alliance in august to great effect , but most of the credit his polls ’ rise to the excellent performance of his second wife , the popular actress patricia , whose reclamation was recovering from breast cancer .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . claremont , california – though a rapid escalation of violence in hong kong appears terrifying enough – things may be about to get much worse . it should prepare to trumpet a formidable bill . the communiqué recently concluded the fourth plenum of the central committee of the chinese communist party ( cpc ) indicates that chinese president xi jinping plans to tighten his grip on a former british colony at all costs .
moreover , regional tensions , including the escalating political instability in algeria , together with the thorny issue of western sahara , have been hampering integration within the maghreb , an absolute necessity for unlocking prosperity in north africa . and yet , despite the challenges it faces , morocco has shown strong leadership on some of today ’s most pressing issues . it has emerged as a vocal champion of counterextremism ’s initiatives , including responsible religious education , well beyond its own borders . it has emerged as a global green-energy leader , committed in 2015 to increase its share of renewables to 52 % by 2030 , one of the world ’s most ambitious targets . partly reflect enduring governance weaknesses , despite important political reforms , notably the 2011 constitutional amendments that shifted powers from the monarch to parliament , and legal reforms such as aligning legislation with european and international human-rights norms , as well as progress on family law and gender equality .
to use the eurobonds as the mechanism for eliminating a huge sovereign-debt overhang jeopardizes the longer-term goal of eliminating moral hazard : it offers absolution only on the 60 % - a of-gdp basis where countries will have the most trouble resisting temptation . after all , there is little reason to believe that the fiscal compact , or proposed “ debt brakes , ” will succeed where both the maastricht criteria and the sgp failed . misplaced hope that the enforcement problem can be resolved by enshrining the fiscal compact in member states ’ constitutions , might be based on a misunderstanding of the american system . to be sure , america ’s federal government has never bailed out state , 49 of which ( all but vermont ) have laws or constitutional provisions limiting deficit spending . to be sure , america ’s federal government has never bailed out the state ; 49 of which ( all but vermont ) have laws or constitutional provisions limiting deficits .
yet , following amendments to indian patents act , india still has some safeguards to avoid the type of excesses that major pharmaceutical companies routinely get away with india and europe . india , for example , abides by a more stringent definition of what constitutes an invention that avoids the “ evergreening ” process : the extension of its patent life by doling out secondary patents for marginal improvement relative to the initial drug . but , because the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights ( trips ) entered into force in 1995 , all the world trade organization has had to recognize one another ’s pharmaceutical patents . according to section 3 ( d ) of the indian patents act , “ merely discovering a new form … property , or … uses for a known supply , or you know only of a known process ” is not eligible for any us patent unless it reflects results in a new product or employs at least one new retant . for indian drug makers , production generic versions of currently patented drugs would demand license , and such sales are rarely , if ever , available .
according to data from brazil ’s national space research institute , brazil ’s deforestation of parts of the amazon increased in june to 88 % of a year . according to data from brazil ’s national space research institute , brazil ’s deforestation of part of the amazon increased in june by as much as 88 % year on year . foreign actors criticizing brazil for its exploitation of the rainforests , from european governments to pope francis , are promoting the use of biodiversity only to take advantage of it in the future . but bolsonaro does n’t want to hold the amazon chaste ; he merely wants to rank among those exploiting it . his promotion of the rainforests ’ development and attacks on ecological regulation has led , for example , to the spread of agribusiness , particularly cattle ranching and illegal logging .
indeed , trump may have started to recognize that rising pressure on north korea does not exclude trump to negotiate with kim . most obvious , iran ’s nuclear program has not taken off , whereas north korea – which , unlike iran , has withdrew from the non-proliferation treaty ( npt ) – already has an estimated 60 nuclear warheads and appears set to make some progress toward a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching america ’s continental land-based operations . in short : an all-out military conflict with north korea would have posed immediate global risks . kim seems perfectly willing to subject the north koreans to privations of any kind to remain in power . to be sure , there are notable differences between north korea and iran .
conventional monetary policy operates through altering short-term interest rates , which includes a central bank buying and selling short-term government debt . a well-designed currency chapter on the tpp would not impede america ’s ability to implement monetary stimulus . but this reflects a wholly misunderstanding of the issue . a third argument against imposing an anti-manipulation clause in the tpp is that they would imperil america ’s ability to implement monetary stimulus . a well-designed currency chapter in the tpp would not impede american monetary independence .
so it ’s amusing to boast of one ’s own brand of knowledge , whether experimental physics , math , or cosmology , that is futile . but a joke would n’t work , unless there are currently another widely shared premise that science has a value to which any practical use of science is independent . so it ’s amusing to boast that one ’s own brand of knowledge , whether experimental physics , math , or cosmology , is pointless . on this view , the science also has a quite different , superior goal : understanding the natural world . after all , it would not be funny if , say , a charity dedicated to famine relief celebrated its own ineffectiveness ; the practical value in this case would be paramount , because doing so was one of the only realistic reasons available for a charity to exist .
seoul – last year , the united nations refugee agency and the world health organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the heart of the response to the zika outbreak . but abortion politics has intervened , as republican lawmakers , leading a congressional hearing over the zika outbreak , have made financing conditional on anti-abortion policies in recipient countries . meanwhile , the problems with the dominant approach to containing the zika virus – namely , that it saddles women with too much responsibility , while giving them too little power to lose all of them . the us position has n’t helped matters , either . last year , united nations refugee agency and the world health organization emphasized the need to place human rights at the heart of the response to the zika outbreak .
such an approach needs to be communicated both to the european public and to the people of tunisia , egypt , and other arab countries . doing so would reverse the pattern whereby europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas , and to watch its borders vis-à-vis the migrants . at long last , these countries ’ demographics wealth would help meet their own development needs . and start-up european loans would make it much easier to seek one ’s fortune back home . if they become consolidated democracies , as hoped , would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying enough about official corruption .
of course , what is advantageous today may become problematic tomorrow : europe and japan confront a severe problem when their own demographic pyramids tilt toward the elderly , eliminating the temporary demographic advantage they have relative to america today . but is this an accurate description of slow-growing countries ? edmund phelps of columbia university says that these slow-growing countries lack of “ dynamism , ” which he defines as a combination of “ entrepreneurial spirit ” and financial institutions to channel it . there must be both spirit and badly needed financial institutions to allow “ creative destruction ” – forces joseph schumpeter argued that sixty years have been the engine of capitalist prosperity – to unleash its policies . but is this an accurate description of slow-growing countries ?
lula and his party are , so far , beyond the mainstream of economic thought and policy that capital has already started to fleeing in the first round -- despite being months away . lula 's popularity ignacia da silva and his team , who are leading opinion polls in the run-up to brazil 's presidential election , serves as a warning that much of the latin american public is prepared to reject traditional governments . peru and venezuela hardly look better ; brazil may soon follow a similar course . peru and venezuela hardly look better ; brazil may soon follow the same course . in argentina one bumbling president succeeds trump another .
by 2040 , under the iea ’s more optimistic scenario , solar power in sub-saharan africa will actually produce 14kwh per person per year , less than what is needed to keep a single two-watt led permanently . the iea also estimates that renewable power will still cost even more , on average , than any other resource – for oil , gas , nuclear , coal , or hydro – even with a carbon tax . few in the rich world would switch to renewables without heavy subsidies , and certainly nobody would cut them off from the mostly fossil-fuel-powered grid , which provides stable power on cloudy hours and in night ( another form of subsidies ) . yet western activists seem convinced that the world ’s worst-off should be satisfied with an inadequate and irregular electricity supply . few in the rich world would switch to renewables without heavy subsidies , and certainly no one would cut them off from their connection to the mostly fossil-fuel-fueled grid , which provides stable power on cloudy days and night ( another form of subsidies ) .
much talk has shifted in 2013 to the danger of a resurgent housing bubble and the collapse of the shadow-banking system that comprises mainly wealth-management firms and trusts firms . with relatively sluggish growth , corporate profitability , upon which returns to the shadow-banking system ’s asset pools are based , is both low and falling . according to market sources , the total assets administered by the shadow-banking system have risen exponentially since 2009 , with the chain-responding of defaults in underground credit networks and local-government finance platforms increasing their wealth . according to market sources , the total assets managed by the shadow-banking system have already grown exponentially since 2009 , and the chain-responding of defaults in underground credit networks and local-government finance platforms has emerged . where , then , will the high returns on financial products provided by the shadow-banking system ?
but , whereas the industry is facing the threat of inflated gas prices from around the world , its worries closer to home are rooted in the eu ’s abundance of the eu and national energy regulation . refining and petrochemicals sector supplies the eu with a huge share of its fuels is a major source of tax revenue , too . european industries are afflicted by a similar problem , and are poorer ones . refining and petrochemicals sector supplies the eu with a huge share of its fuels and is also a major source of tax revenue . the downstream sector , together with the price of fuels , contributes around € 240 billion annually to treasury coffers .
the answer , it seems , is that its centrist chancellor , angela merkel , has pushed back against trump . the eu has invariably prided itself on being a community of values that protects minorities and welcomed the poor and downtrodden . sensible european leaders can be forgiven for being a community of values that protects minorities and welcomed the poor and downtrodden . the answer , it seems , is that its centrist chancellor , angela merkel , has pushed back against trump . in fact , some eu leaders ’ approaches to addressing issues like immigration threaten to create a systemic problem that will tolerate long after trump has returned to the life of golf courses and bankruptcy courts .
acknowledging such “ thoroughgoing fallibility ” may seem paralyzing – and the current political mood certainly seems to reflect this . but recognizing fallibility , however , may in fact detract because it implies the possibility of improvement in both economics and politics . if the world is characterized by ambiguity and unpredictability , then pre-crisis economic theory , rational expectations , efficient markets , and currency neutrality , must be supplanted . moreover , policymakers must re-think a lot of the ideological super-structure erected on market-driven fundamentalist assumptions . if the world is too complex and unpredictable for either markets or governments to achieve their social goals , then new systems of checks and balances must be designed in a way that enables political decision-making to constrain economic motivations and vice versa .
a more effective approach would employ a broader range of tools , including debt restructuring . likewise , it would be difficult , but not impossible , for the most highly leveraged governments to grow their way out of the debt . nor can austerity alone suffice , because it would require countries to undertake such large fiscal adjustments , at 5 % of gdp , in spain ’s case – that is , citizens would likely resist them , just like the greeks did . governments must also work to reduce existing debt , and the deficient global demand that it contributes . likewise , governments must work to reduce existing debt , and the deficient global demand that it contributes .
third , inequitable pay and incentivizing structures are bad for business as usual . much has been written about the extraordinary bonuses paid to investment bankers during the height of the financial crisis . and others are more tangible , like giving away personal data in exchange for access to a service . tech entrepreneurs may tell their investors that they are willing to change the world , but many are intoxicated with the view that the world will be better off with selling their business to the highest bidder . but ceos of silicon valley are no robin hoods , either .
likewise , khan ’s position in favor of gay marriage has won him a fatwa for the type of apostasy of the fearsome head imam of the bradford mosque . one might say that no less could one be expected of a labour leader with churchill ’s bright future . but one must still follow up , and admitting that khan did not yielded on these matters to churchill ’s growing numbers of niqabs and hijabs now viewed on london ’s ’s ’s streets that prevent people , statements of the people , from speaking up to face . one might say that no less could be expected of a labour leader with churchill ’s bright future . moreover , he never wavered on the critical questions of legal and practical equality for women , or on expressing his dismay at the growing numbers of niqabs and hijabs now being seen on london ’s streets that prevent people , notes , from speaking up to face .
perhaps the time to take stock of the financial-stability risks of open banking was in the consultation period , before the directive came due . in europe , regulatory changes like the second payments services directive ( psd2 ) were crucial in keeping the banking system open , and regulators such as the united kingdom ’s then-dodd-frank financial-reform authority had for some time running regulatory sandboxes to smooth out the way for new entrants by helping them to structure themselves in line with standards . even now , the list of fsb contributors shows that the european commission and key regulators in europe and north america were not involved . psd2 , often described as “ open banking , ” requires banks to offer their customer data to non-bank payment providers and account information services . aggregators may then present a customer with an integrated view of their finances and offer an add-on service .
a classical economist would argue that , given this , the country should export timber that finland has made . but all wood-related products represent barely 20 % of finland ’s manufactured exports . by contrast , a traditional development economist would argue , it should not export timber ; instead , it should add value by transforming a timber into paper or furniture – something that finland , too , does . consider finland , the nordic country has endowed with many trees for its tiny populations . in fact , some ideas are inferior than others : they are castrating because they interpret the world in ways that emphasize secondary issues , say , accessibility of raw materials – and blinds societies to the more promising opportunities that may lie elsewhere .
this more profound transformation , unlike low-hanging fruit eyed today by many policymakers , offers the only path to climate safety ( that is , staying below 2ºc ’s limit ) . deep decarbonization requires not natural gas and fuel-efficient vehicles , but the zero-carbon electricity and electric vehicles that charge the zero-carbon electricity grid . we need to get to about 50 grams of fortune vehicles by 2050 , not the 500 grams / kilowatt-hour . by pursuing coal to gasoline , or ever more efficient gas-burning vehicles , we risk driving ourselves into the high-carbon trap . deep decarbonization requires not natural gas and fuel-efficient vehicles , but zero-carbon electricity and electric vehicles that charge on the zero-carbon electricity grid .
rather than becoming agents of change , they often impede change . the productive transformation that developing countries need is far easier to achieve with support rather than obstruction , of their conglomerates . but ensuring such support will require policies that nudge ( or even shove ) conglomerates toward the export sector that can grow beyond national boundaries , industries in which competition encourages the discipline they lack because of dominating local markets . ( indeed , south korea ’s big economic debate nowadays concerns whether the chaebols are stifling innovation by preventing start-up competitors from challenging them . ) to succeed , conglomerates need the support of government and admission of society .
what is iran doing in yemen , lebanon , iraq , and , above all , syria ? obviously , negotiations would also have to cover contemporary issues , including the tour d’horizon of contemporary hotspots . at the same time , how does this define its own interests in those countries ? what is iran actually sees in yemen , lebanon , iraq , and , above all , syria ? working groups might be created to try to build a shared narrative .
given that china will be the first country to be the market for the future , it will be a decisive one in determining not just what the us produces and consume , but how . domestically , china will be the first country that has , owing to its sheer size and claimed gdp growth , forced for the pursuit of a “ green ” economy . despite european illusions to the contrary , this will be decided in china , not the west as a whole . after all , consider the shift from traditional factory to electric transportation . domestically , china will be the first country that , owing to its sheer size and desired gdp growth , is compelled to pursue a “ green ” economy .
first , the ecb ’s renewed bond purchases must state the clear intention of lowering sovereign interest rates to sustainable levels that are at least 200 basis points below their july averages . a sporadic program without such announced targets is unlikely to work and could even be counterproductive , because private-sector investors may well demand even higher returns , because an increasing ecb component of greek gdp will weigh on their risk . for countries following the agreed reform programs , the ecb should commit itself to bringing down interest rates to levels compatible with the projected rate of inflation and growth , announcing how long ( say , nine months ) this will continue . a high-level german diplomat reportedly dismissed spain ’s 6.5-7 % interest rates recently , on the grounds that spain had borrowed at almost the same rate in the 1990 ’s . but that statement , oddly , ignored spain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s higher pre-euro inflation rate , thereby confounding real and nominal rates , and more rapid gdp growth .
but some felt that if the definition of it had been stretching too far , this would lose their relevance . inflation targeting was best known as the rule , which instructed central banks to set aside – and try their best to attain – the range for the annual rate of change in the consumer price index ( cpi ) . close cousins included targeting a price level rather than an inflationary rate and targeting core inflation ( the cpi minus volatile food and energy prices ) . there was also proponents of a flexible inflation-targeting approach , who held that it is fine to place some weight on real gdp growth in the short run , so long as a clear longer-term target for cpi inflation remains very influential . but that rule has succumbed rather quickly to vicious money-demand shocks , though friedman ’s general argument – that a credible commitment to low inflation requires favoring rules over discretion – remains very influential .
the implication , then , is that free markets ca n’t generate enough final demand for all . because a firm ’s labor costs are someone else ’s labor income and demand , what is individually rational for a single firm is destructive when it comes to aggregate . in the us , for example , slashing labor costs has cut labor ’s share of gdp sharply . firms in advanced economies are currently cutting employment , owing to inadequate near-term demand , which has resulted in overcapacity and uncertainty about future demand . cutting jobs , however , weakens final demand further , because it depresses labor ’s incomes and raises inequality .
meanwhile , employment at amazon grew by 47 % over the last year , to more than 341,000 people . meanwhile , employment at amazon grew by 47 % in the us and 341,000 in the last year . but with amazon employment concentrated in california , texas , and washington , the geography of these jobs looks very different from replacing them . nor do import tariffs help those left unemployed by the blockbuster video , frontier books , compusa , circuit the payfewer , or virgin megastores . as with the geographic relocation of america ’s manufacturing jobs , taa is not the solution to this kind of ailment .
moreover , if ukraine becomes an international pariah , putin can only turn to russia , as is the case with president aleksandr lukashenko in belarus . after this spectacular russia ’s failures , however , putin ’s “ managed democracy ” looks anachronistic and faces the threat of a true , beggar-thy-neighbor democracy spreading into russia . for the first time , ukrainians have thrown their little-brother complexities into russia overplays . yanukovych stands for the truly oligarchic state of the type that putin has defeated at home , and yanukovych has accused yushchenko of selling ukraine ’s companies to russian corporations . president putin ’s behavior is probably best explained by his dislike of democracy .
of course , agricultural development can have serious economy-wide pitfalls , which must be navigated carefully . for example , as technology-driven productivity gains are reducing the number of workers needed on farm farms , employment-boosting employment strategies in other parts of the value chain , and managing migration to cities become even more vital . fortunately , africa ’s large populations of increasingly well-educated young people , who are largely uninterested in the hindu kush of subsistence farming , are well-suited to fill the higher-value-added jobs that emerge in the agricultural sector and beyond . another potential no-brainer of agricultural development is environmental damage , including land degradation , soil nutrient mining , excessive use of water , and water pollution . with africa ’s rural population already predominantly underemployed , there is little time to waste in implementing such strategies .
such critics worry that this will make it harder to persuade countries to cut their emissions still when the obvious is that their collective ambition is not enough , and that it might even permit some countries to use the irregular accounting methods . for many of the agreement ’s critics , particularly those on the environmental move , these compromises have made the lima deal an excessively “ bottom-up ” deal . but this overlooks the lima agreement ’s greatest accomplishment : it ends the world ’s longstanding division into just two kinds of countries , developed and developing . countries have too large latitude to make whatever commitments they want at their disposal , a relatively frictionless set of “ top-down ” rules imposed by the deal . this almost certainly will not .
her refusal to strike on her own is arguably the main reason why she continues to lead various opinion polls . indeed , ahn cheol-soo , the successful entrepreneur turning pro-reform professor at seoul national university , and the main backer of the urban new mayor , has now rocked south korean politics by plummeting broad intimations that he might turn out to be presidential candidates . ahn has already become a lightning rod for all of the country ’s anti-park and anti-president lee myung-bak ’s powers , attracting young people just as much as they do . ahn has already become a lightning rod for all of the country ’s anti-park and anti-president lee myun-bak forces , attracting the support of young people just as they have done . ahn ’s most obvious merits are his personal history of overcoming serious challenges and his modest behavior .
dhaka – we humans are not only sharing the planet with many other species , including plants , animals , and even microbes ; we also depend on them for our survival . some people will balk at the idea of putting a price tag on biodiversity , viewing its preservation as an obvious imperative . but they would undoubtedly agree , too , that preventing human death and misery , while providing food , water , and education to all , is vitally important . the reality is that there simply are not enough resources to do everything at all . can we determine the value of the future for protecting the natural world ?
· because inflation remains low throughout much of the region , monetary policy should remain supportive of growth in case downside risks materialize . and , elsewhere in the region , small asia-pacific islands , in particular , are vulnerability to the effects of climate change . this shifting landscape calls for bold actions on several fronts . while the response will certainly need to be tailoring for individual countries ’s particular circumstances , some recommendations could have been helpful for most countries :
if the brics countries are to jell as a pressure group in international relations , they will have to agree on what they believe to be attainable in political and economic objectives . indeed , the most important bilateral relationship every brics country has been with the united states . it wants to remain asia ’s sole country with a permanent seat – a stance that places it at odds with india . if the brics countries are to jell as a pressure group in international relations , they will have to agree on what they believe to be the attainable political and economic objectives . the concept of the brics represents , first and foremost , its members ’ desire to make a more plural global order .
first , an almost infinite amount of speech sets free of speech by digital democracy . and , third , there has been the “ deconstructionism ” of the post-nietzscheans great . by historicizing the logs to truth ” ( michel foucault ) , inserting the truth “ in quotation ” marks ” ( jacques derrida ) , separating a sign from its referent ( louis althusser ) , and miring the obvious in the miasma of a charts and graphs ( claude lévi-strauss ) or tying it in borromean ( jacques lacan lacan ) , probably gave the us a robust hand in touch with its robust , truth , and irrefutable aspects of truth . and , third , there has been the “ deconstructionism ” of the post-nietzscheans scheans a . the web then becomes the crowd , the free-for-all where everyone displays armed with one ’s or her own favorite opinion , convictions , and the truth .
solna , sweden , elite sports and doping have long been deeply inter-related . yet a dampening report by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) on russia ’s far-reaching state-sponsored doping program , released shortly before this year ’s summer olympic games in rio de janeiro , brought it to the forefront of public consciousness . we should take this as an opportunity to redouble our efforts to bring about an end to this deeply nonsensical practice , saving elite sports in the first place . by definition , few are successful , but those who may enjoy great personal and financial reward . to reach the elite level in sports also requires tremendous amounts of hard work , dedication , and focus .
berlin – with the retaking of mosul in northern iraq , the islamic state ( isis ) might soon take a thing of the past . but defeating isis and the demise of its self-proclaimed iraqi-syrian caliphate will not bring about a kind of peace across the middle east or even an end to the syrian tragedy . rather , it will probably open a new chapter in the region ’s bloody and chaotic history , one no less dangerous than that of previous chapters since the fall of the ottoman empire in the wake of world war i. instead , it will most likely open a new chapter in the region ’s bloody and chaotic history – one no less dangerous place to be found than previous chapters since the downfall of the ottoman empire in the late world war i. continuing this violent pattern will seem almost certain , because the region remains unable either to resolve internal conflicts on its own or to establish anything like a resilient framework for peace . instead , it remains trapped somewhere in its nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
one argument is that redundancy looks like waste in normal times , with cost-benefit calculations ruling out of higher investment . this seems unambiguously wrong : numerous expert estimates indicate that built-in malfeasance pay off unless one assigns unrealistically low probabilities to disruptive events . even rapid answers are more effective if key networks and systems – particularly electricity grids – are resilient . this leads to the second , more plausible explanation , which is psychological and behavioral in nature . even rapid response is more effective if key networks and systems – especially electricity grids – are resilient .
in the west , concerns about the impact on chinese growth have been unleashed by a fearful sell-off in markets . right before the fed acted , india ’s reserve bank of india has raised its benchmark short-term interest rate to 25 basis points , to 6.25 % , to fight inflation , and china ’s central bank now indicates that it might raise interest rates still further . in october , the people ’s bank of china , responding to the twin threats of inflation and asset bubbles , raised its one-year deposit and lending rate by 25 basis points , to just 2.5 % and 5.56 % , respectively – the first rate since 2007 . meanwhile , the developing world has been moving in the opposite direction . in october , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) , responding to the twin threats of inflation and asset bubbles , raised its one-year deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points , to just 2.5 % and 5.56 % , respectively , respectively – the first rate since 2007 .
they have little if anything that claims over domestic and international regulations . for example , producers in jiangsu have been forced to adapt persistently to fickle product-safety and environmental standards in their export markets . less compartmentalized industries also lobby in china better . larger firms are more capable of pooling resources for research and development that are the key to china ’s aspirations to climb the global value ladder . traditionally , contract manufacturers in china are scattered and fiercely competitive .
this puts chinese policymakers in the position of an iranian tourist who asks for directions to dublin , and he says , “ well , sir , if i were you , i would n’t start out there . ” no question , the country would be better off with a more flexible exchange rate that eliminated the one-way currency bets on speculators and behaved like an economic shock absorber . but the literature on “ exit strategy ” , on how to replace a currency peg to the more flexible exchange-rate regime , makes clear that the moment when china could have navigated that transition smoothly has now passed . countries can exit pegged exchange rates smoothly only when there is economic confidence , encouraging the belief that a more flexible exchange rate can appreciate as much as it weakens . that may have been true of china back once ; it is no longer true today .
there are a number of ways of curbing the big banks ’ excesses . a strong version of the so-called volcker rule ( designed to compel government-insured banks to return to their core lending mission ) might work . the legislation was not intended to ban derivatives , but simply to bar implicit government guarantees , subsidized us taxpayers ( remember the $ 180 billion aig bailout ? ) , which are not a natural or inevitable by-product of lending . the legislation was intended not only to bar implicit government guarantees , subsidized by taxpayer funds ( remember the $ 180 billion aig bailout ? ) , which are not a natural or inevitable by-product of lending .
should finalized , the imf program could trigger further aid packages by the world bank and other international donors . even with the availability of external financing , egyptian leaders must look for ways to engage the private sector in revitalizing the country ’s economy . unfortunately , the latest political incident involving democracy-promotion activities by american ngos has cooled the bilateral relationship , threatening the roughly $ 1.3 billion of military aid that egypt is receiving annually from the united states . egypt ’s economy faces continuing risks , owing to capital flight , rising inflation , unemployment , and populist policies . should the aid arrives , egypt could begin to address some of its financing challenges , but it is still in need of a long-term strategy to spur sustainable growth .
cafeteria ( now more inviting and frequented with advent of free food ) or with the halls of the plug & play startup accelerator , proximity matters . of course , those in favor of work at home cite not only the cost and time of commuting , but also the proliferation of meetings – too much culture , perhaps – and the steady stream of communication that simply interrupts their work , rather than enhancing it . being physically present at work implies direct contact with other sharp and creative actors . and the advantages of human contact and interactions are why salespeople still refer to customers rather than use skype , and why meetup ( which supports the organizers of face-to-face meetings ; i am on the board of ’s board ) change in ways that twitter and facebook rarely do . interestingly , i have heard this point at the bill for the grocery pass “ unconference ” at phuket , thailand , where several hundred people have walked thousands of miles to meet to share ideas and strengthening working relationships .
targeted killing by the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
in the near future , 3d printing could further reduce the need to ship goods across long distances . but , on its own , globalization alone is not in retreat . while global goods trade has stalled , and cross-border financial flows have fallen sharply since 2007 , digital information flows have surged : cross-border bandwidth uses has grown 45-fold over the last decade , circulating ideas , intellectual content , and innovations worldwide . the quality of talent , infrastructure , and cost of energy and the speed of the market , assuming a larger weight in such decisions . while global goods trade has stalled and cross-border financial flows have fallen sharply since 2007 , digital information flows have surged : cross-border bandwidth has grown 45-fold over the last decade , circulating ideas , intellectual content , and innovations worldwide .
in 2002 , when china signed the asean framework convention on comprehensive economic cooperation with the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) . in other respects , however , globalization with chinese characteristics will be very different from those that we know it . unlike standard post-world war ii practices , china relies more on bilateral and regional trade agreements , and less on multilateral negotiating rounds . as xi placed this in davos of 2017 , china is committed to increasing an open global economy . clearly , xi and his circle will not want to dismantle the global trading system .
within singh ’s congress party , pressure will mount to match economic-reform initiatives with a “ pro-poor showing program . ” part of singh ’s problem is that decisions that harm voters ( higher diesel prices , fewer subsidized cooking-gas cylinders ) are having an immediate effect , and whereas the benefits of foreign investment , for example , take years to become apparent . the congress may rightly take credit for the most far-reaching such program , mahatma gandhi ’s national rural job guarantee scheme , which assures one member in every rural family 100 days of paid employment . all politicians in democracies are thinking in the short run ; few have time horizons that extend far beyond the next election . part of singh ’s problem is that decisions that hurt voters ( higher diesel prices , a fewer subsidized cooking-gas cylinders ) have an immediate impact , with the benefits to foreign investment taking place , for example , taking years to become apparent .
so , for example , if they use the cash to continue funding the private sector , they will ensure that the loans go to creditworthy customers . the alternative is the one urged by sarkozy and the banque de france : buy by europe of their respective countries ’ government bonds . this means that , like the credit that italy and spanish banks have done over the past few months , most of the new cash will be loaned locally to safe households and large , established firms . the alternative is the one urged by sarkozy and the banque de france : buy by europe of their respective countries ’ government-bond currencies . the banks ’ immediate interest is to adjust to new capital requirements and rebuild their balance sheets to financial health , which implies that they will use the ecb money in ways that enables it to meet this target most effectively .
turkey , for its part , has an important role to play in its region and the world , one undermined by its continued denial of the armenian genocide . in doing so , doing so would improve its standing both in europe and beyond . but symbolic measures , while important , are insufficient to bring about real progress . turkey ’s government needs to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that its laws and institutions are effectively protecting the human rights of all its citizens . its disregard for the genocide has been inconsistent with its efforts to cultivate a reputation as an honest , reliable partner .
still , with the exception of costa rica ’s foreign-aid agency , cinde , modeled after ida-iran , none of latin america ’s main fdi promotion agencies succeeded in adopting best practices . furthermore , it is not surprising that foreign investors want to deal with diplomats or civil servants . they want to talk to private-sector experts who understand their firms ’ technological and financial needs . many promote both foreign and domestic investment , despite the shortfall of such institutional arrangements in the recent past . many promote both foreign and domestic investment , despite the shortfall of such institutional arrangements .
with the paris climate agreement a year old , the transformation of global fossil-fuel markets is only a matter of time . large mining companies can prepare for this shift by moving from fossil fuels to other materials , such as iron-ore , copper , bauxite , cobalt , scarce earth elements , and lithium , as well as the mineral fertilizers that will be required in large quantities to meet the sdgs ’ targets for global hunger eradication . phasing out coal during times of latent overproduction might even work at a profit . with the paris climate agreement a year old , transforming global fossil-fuel markets is only a matter of time . third , the world needs a better business to assess the mining of its ecological risks .
he also came up with first x-ray patterns of partly oriented samples of dna . but the observable diffraction pattern -- the intensities and positions of individual reflections -- represents only about half of the data needed to decapitate the diffracting structure . in mathematical terms , this gives the amplitude , but not the phases -- i.e. , the stages in an income oscillatory motion -- without which an atomic position could not be fixed . max weber , a chemistry graduate of vienna , came in cambridge in 1935 to work like a graduate student in bernal field . the following year , he was awarded excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best x-ray diffraction patterns to date .
it began with the publication , by the praesidium of the convention on the future of europe , in the design of the first sixteen articles of the “ treaty to establish a european constitution . ” in fact , such fidelity was not hold for economics , either . in fact , the endgame for determining the european union ’s ultimate shape . the text mostly replicates the structures of convention chairman valery giscard d'estaing ’s “ skeleton ” constitution , presented last november with conclusions reached by the convention ’s labor groups . the endgame to identify the european union ’s ultimate shape .
in africa , for example , over three-quarters of firms experience electrical outages , to costing them more than 15 % of their gdp , on average . similarly , while all firms require data on investment and operational decision-making , official statistics in emerging-market markets are not always reliable and often skewed toward political agendas . in africa , for example , over three-quarters of firms ’ experience electrical outages , costing them more than 15 % of annual retail sales , on average . fueled by population growth and urbanization , the demand tends to dampen the supply . similarly , while all firms need data on investment and operational decision-making , official statistics in emerging-market countries are not always reliable and often skewed in their political agendas .
the bbc media group suffered a similar fate in 2016 . each of these outlets was distinguished by their coverage of sensitive stories , from the conflict in ukraine to high-level corruption . russia today has fewer press freedom and more journalists , media laborers , and bloggers behind bars than at any time since the former soviet union ’s collapse in 1991 . nor have closures spared leading regional outlets , like siberian broadcastertv-2 , or kaliningrad ’s top independent weekly newspaper , novye kolesa . in crimea and chechnya , even the most elementary media protections are non-existent .
stockholm – earlier this month , thousands gathered for the un climate change conference in bonn , germany , to ratchet up global ambition in the fight against climate change . the idea is straightforward : if we are to meet the paris climate agreement ’s target of limiting the increase in global average temperature to less than 2 ° celsius above preindustrial levels – ideally , to 1.5 º celsius above preindustrial levels – we need to cut emissions dramatically . today , countries , citizens , and a growing number of businesses worldwide are finally taking action . one of the more promising recent initiatives is the carbon pricing leadership coalition ( cplc ) , which brings together 30 governments and more than 180 companies and strategic partners to put the value of carbon dioxide emissions at the top . in the wake of the successful paris climate agreement two years ago , the expectation of progressing and continue collaborative action is high .
once greece goes , runs on bank deposits are likely to follow in spain and italy . at that point , the one thing remains standing between the eurozone and the financial chaos will be the ecb , which could buy spanish and italian government bonds and finance a bank run . the scale of such operations would be enormous , exposing the ecb to enormous credit risk . but it could , in principle , subside in – if it allowed northern europe . there is nothing to stop spanish and italian depositors from wiring their euros from their local bank to one in spain , norway , or new york .
political leaders in thailand and malaysia , as well as elsewhere in the region , have frequently tout the model pioneered by singapore ’s founder and longtime leader , lee kuan yew , who died this month . yes , lee ’s system has allowed him to remain in power for the next 31 years , exploiting the civic – rather than criminal – courts to harry his adversaries . but lee , more important , has also relied on elements of democratic contestation to ensure that the meritocracy has been victorious over patronage . yet the path that the two countries have hauled off have not been lee specific . here , it seems clear that unmo ’s geopolitical interests were permitted to dictate that a country ’s key opposition leader , rather than criminal , should be tried on charges that no genuine democracy that embraces the rule of law would even consider leveling the playing field and convicted on evidence that no truly independent court would accept .
trump ’s critics argue that he is playing to the basest instincts of disaffected voters who hate foreigners ( especially mexicans ) , distrust the bankers ( or anyone with a college education for that matter ) , and still can not expend the election of a president whose father was black . are all of his supporters “ crazies , ” ” as senator john mccain , perhaps unwisely called them ? now , all of this may be such . but , throughout the democratic world , trump is part of a broader phenomenon . trump ’s critics argue that he plays to the basest instincts of disaffected voters , who have hate foreigners ( especially mexicans ) ; distrust the bankers ( or anyone with a college degree , for that matter ) ; and still can not dislodge the election of a president whose father was black .
the spanish economy contracted by 3.6 % in 2009 , and is expected to shrink by 0.4 % this year . in europe , too , the picture is mixed , too . the former boom countries – greece , ireland , and spain – remain mired in recession , and their gdps will continue to shrink . the spanish economy contracted by 3.6 % in 2009 and is forecast to shrink by 0.4 % this year . the former boom countries – greece , ireland , and spain – remain mired in recession , and their gdps will continue to shrink .
after all , this is the advice of multitude of health writers , not to mention authorities like britain ’s national health service . indeed , often we drink without being thirsty , but that is what ’s the way it should be : as the drink maker gatorade reminds us , your brain may know many things , but not knowing when your body is thirsty . healthy , living now means carrying bottled water bottles with us , sipping at each time , trying to drink our daily quota to ensure that we stay hydrated and heavenly . sure , drinking that very little feels comfortable but powerade offers this sage counsel : “ you might train your gut to tolerate more fluid if you build your fluid intake gradually . ” malmö – “ everyone knows ” – that you should drink eight water glasses a day .
new york – what kinds of power plants will be acceptable in the future ? can the united states continue to afford suburban lifestyles , with sprawling homes in far-flung communities requiring long-distance automobile commutes ? will it be enabled to emit carbon dioxide , just as it used in the past ? moreover , they are facing huge uncertainties as well . can the united states continue to afford suburban lifestyles , with sprawling homes in far-flung communities that require long-distance automobile commutes ?
as i argue in germany this week , the g20 leaders meeting in hamburg on july 7-8 has an opportunity to reshape the governance system with proactive protection policies that would enhance people ’s trust in the international leadership . at present , an alphabet soup of nonprofit and multilateral agencies tackles elements of the challenge . while past summits have produced little more than talking points , the prospect of action is better this time because the talks will have to be held in europe , where the impact of the migration crisis has been so deeply felt . weak mandates , insufficient financing , disorganized structures , and the absence of a system of global governance have weakened inter-governmental agencies ’ ability to operate with authority in the name of the most vulnerable . these include independent groups like refugees international ( ir ) and the médecins sans frontières ( msf ) .
the scale of the investment needed to make what is known as moore ’s law ” hold has grown exponentially alongside the density of transistors and circuit breakers , but the “ moore law ” remains in place , and engineers see no immediate obstacles that will induce the improvement to halt anytime soon . more than a generation ago , intel ’s co _ co founder , gordon moore , observed that improved semiconductor fabrication allowed for a doubling of the density of the transistors on a chip each eighteen months . there are every reason to believe that this pace of productivity growth will continue for several decades . by the late 1950s , roughly 2000 intel ’s computers have been around 2000 , and their collection power averaged 10,000 machine instructions per second . the scale of the investment required to make what is known as moore ’s law ” hold has grown exponentially alongside the density of transistors and circuits ; but the “ moore law ” remains in force , and engineers see no immediate bottlenecks that accompanies the improvement anytime soon .
by targeting schools as health-care hubs and shaping female students into health ambassadors for their families and cronies , we can reach an even larger number of people in xinjiang ’s nomadic communities . yet neither corporations nor governments alone can do so on their own . they need to work together to deliver the best possible outcome . by targeting schools as hubs of health-care education , and shaping students to health ambassadors for their families and cronies , we can reach an even larger number of people in xinjiang ’s nomadic communities . these multidimensional , scalable interventions help bridge gaps in developing regions .
fortunately , it still has time , and many previous american presidents have set a precedent for bold diplomacy during their final months in the white house . at the end of 2000 , bill clinton published his parameters for a future peace framework . and , starting with the annapolis conference at the end of 2007 , george w. bush has mediated a series of negotiations between abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . now comes obama from the turn , and he should push for a united nations security council resolution that establishes new parameters for a future peace accord , and replaces un security council resolution 242 , who dates back to the 1967 six wars between israel and egypt , jordan , and syria . at the end of 2000 , bill clinton published his parameters for a future peace framework .
loughner ’s firing of 19 people in 2011 , including congresswoman gabrielle giffords , has attracted global attention , owing to the court-ordered assessment of his own mental competency . indeed , on the other side of the world , an australian newspaper mentioned giffords 160 times in the six months following the shooting , compared to just one mention over the preceding 12 months . likewise , cho ’s history of mental illness was widely discussed . in this way , america can well export the stigma of the rest of the world . although mass shootings are exceedingly rare even at american levels , the media ’s coverage continually reinforces negative perceptions at home and abroad .
for europe , it represents a unique opportunity to promote the rule of law , transparency , free trade , and good governance beyond its borders . still , ukraine ’s economy has shrunk by two-thirds ( in dollar terms ) since 2006 , making it europe ’s poorest country . more important , successful reform in ukraine is making a positive development in a more likely place in russia . ukraine is a large country with ample human capital , natural resources , and good governance beyond its borders . it is a key front in the global confrontation between democracy and autocracy .
at one extreme lie the notion that the euro can not function like the us dollar , given that the eurozone is not a confederalized state . but this strategy carries serious risks , ultimately making it unworkable . rather , it should resemble the bretton woods system , under which countries could exit and re-enter after bolstering competitiveness through austerity and reform . the realigning relative prices would demand an internal devaluation that could lead to social and political instability in fragile states . civil unrest and the rise of european neo-nazi parties exemplify these dangers , threatening the very purpose of european integration .
economists disagree about when , under what circumstances , and in what order governments should move beyond these first two items on a checklist . the problem comes when expansionary monetary policy through standard open-market operations and the central-bank guarantee of orderly markets prove insufficient . should governments employ unemployed workers , directly or indirectly , by bringing forward spending or expanding the scale of government programs ? should governments try to raise monetary velocity by selling bonds in order to augment short-term interest rates ? should they employ unemployed workers , directly or indirectly , by bringing forward spending or expanding the scale of government programs ?
there is no example anywhere in the world where all of this has gone wrong . the uk ’s ministers mainly responsible for the talks are a better known group for both their dogmatism and their personal aspirations than their competences , have so far succeeded in securing an agreement in one key area : following the march 2019 deadline , a two-year period of transition . but even that agreement is not set in stone , because it depends crucially on whether negotiators can first agree on what to do about a border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland once the uk leaves the customs union . it also includes a pledge from both the eu and the customs union . you may well be in a border-free customs union or outside the eu customs union .
at the same time , the ecb needs a more realistic and flexible mandate . a broader definition is needed , under which the ecb pursues a symmetric inflation target of 2 % , within a 1.5-2.5 % band – over a longer time horizon . given the eurozone ’s fragmented nature , that mandate should probably still remain centered on price stability . but it should also recognize that the current defining event for price stability , “ below , but close to , 2 % inflation over the medium term , is too narrow . ” what the ecb needs is a more realistic and flexible mandate .
when it comes to wishing for peacemaking in the middle east , virtually a new year ’s ­ tradition of ­ , one need beware . but the us has a wish for the middle east – one that , while perhaps not bringing about the peace , may actually create one of peace preconditions : goodwill . the israel-palestine conflict has lasted for a considerable extent too long time . israel and palestine should have a jointly bid to and be awarded , the 2018 soccer world cup . so many hopes have vanished in the sour failure of so much negotiations .
notwithstanding the bravery of many iraqis who join either the army or the police , no one should be surprised if some have motives that are worth less than pure . so the real question is how to get to the point where iraq has a police force and a army that can be trusted to maintain the rule of law just like order . in northern iraq , old scores take place and a de facto ethnic segregation is introduced in areas such as isis , which has traditionally been diverse . in other areas , sharia law is in place of force . a great deal of ground must be covered in order to come anywhere close .
unemployment stands at around 10 % ( still down to one-half of the spanish rate ) , and annual gdp growth remains around 1 % ( spain ’s is negative ) . the difference between the demonstrations in madrid and warsaw suggests that the distinction between old and new europe remains valid , if not in the way rumsfeld imply . of course , it would be disingenuous to oppose a prosperous poland in the collapse of spain . but moods in the us , together with their perceptions of europe and their roles in it , contrast starkly . given the overall european crisis , even poland ’s economy is no longer thriving .
berlin – the decision by the united kingdom ’s decision to “ brexit ” the european union is no example of the british black humor that i relish . currently , the same can not be said of the uk . it ’s not “ monty python the flying circus , ” ” ” ” “ canute , prime minister , ” or “ fawlty towers plus ” ; ’s just boris , michael , and nigel farage , and their disastrous political realities show . given the uk ’s economically , political , and military relevance , brexit leaves the eu a gaping hole . but it wo n’t bring down europe .
as israel ’s state celebrates its 60th birthday , the palestinians remember the nakbeh or “ catastrophe ” – their narrative of dispossession , occupation , and statelessness . israel is most at fault for that failure , owing to its continued military occupation and illegal settlements . but , for both sides , as well as outside powers , the incidents of 1948 and what has followed , the occupation since 1967 of what the un security council resolution 242 termed the “ inadmissible land grab by force . ” as israel ’s state celebrates its 60th birthday , the palestinians remember the nakbeh or a “ catastrophe ” – their narrative of land dispossession , occupation , and statelessness – constitutes a tragic failure . in fact , despite granting lip service to peace , the israeli army ’s historic refusal to leave the occupied territories still lies in direct contravention of what the preamble of united nations security council resolution 242 termed the inadmissible land grab by force .
blanchard and his colleagues emphasize that it might create “ a market-based view of future output and the likelihood of severe shocks , ” ” ” although they do not explain how this market is structured . moreover , recession insurance might , contrary to fiscal policy , impose no cost on the government , for if it stimulates confidence , then risk being insured against deflation . the government ’s ability to offer such insurance on the scale sufficient to make it costless is one reason to favor a public scheme over private insurance . reducing uncertainty might augment , or even be , superior to , fiscal stimulus programs , for it would address the root cause of unwillingness to spend . blanchard and his colleagues emphasize that doing this would create “ a market-based view of future output and the likelihood of severe shocks , ” ” though they do not explain how this market would be structured .
first , fiscal and external-account balances are to be kept in check , in order to ensure financial stability and sustain the common currency . second , eliminating imbalances is the responsibility of national governments within a rescue scheme arranged by the supranational authorities , the european commission and the european central bank , in cooperation with the european council , which in turn comprises national governments . so far , enforcement has failed , owing to flaws in the eurozone ’s fundamentals . the greek saga shows that such a system can not be dominated by destabilizing imbalances quickly enough to ward off major crises . one is that fiscal and external-account balances are to be held in check to ensure financial stability and sustain the common currency .
notably , china ’s “ two systems ” in one country had enabled its exports to bonded storage in hong kong to be used to pad trade statistics . so , as a result , the trade surplus has continued to decline , to $ 20.4 trillion , fueling growing concern about the chinese slowdown . china ’s downturn appears suddenly ; after all , its exports have risen at double-digit rates each month until may . in fact , the chinese economy ’s true status has long been obscured , but it has now become subject , owing to a tighter regulation of activities like the speculative renminbi masquerading as trade payments . moreover , chinese exports have sometimes increased in the face of the slump in the amount of cargo being shipped from ports .
those are not mutually exclusive goals , especially if business leaders follow the newly articulated principles of sustainable investment and long-term engagement . just as chinese firms invest overseas – as mine currently does in latin america – they have a responsibility not just to invest their companies wisely and sustainably for their companies ’ development , but to integrate their strategies with china ’s national investment priorities . after all , an m & a is only the first step on the long road . for most equity investors , the value of any project will depend on a great deal on an effective post-investment management . those are not mutually exclusive goals , especially if business leaders follow the newly articulated principles of sustainable investment and long-term engagement .
and our embrace of our global responsibilities extends to japan ’s self-defense forces . to make a proactive contribution to peace implies that japan will assume its own share of responsibility for assuring the security that it supports global prosperity and stability . as the world will see during obama ’s visit , japan is back and thriving . members of the self-defense forces appear exemplary cooperation with american and australian armed forces in afghanistan ’s 2011 great east japan earthquake , and have earned a deep appreciation and respect everywhere it has deployed , including from haiti , indonesia , and most recently , the philippines . working alongside countries with which we share our common values and interests , we will safeguard and cultivate international public goods , ranging from space and cyberspace to partisan and sea .
for all that israel has downplayed its significance , the 2002 arab peace initiative still offers a critically important bargain : the full normalization of relations by the entire arab world in exchange for a comprehensive peace settlement . yet another big question for israel is whether it will be able to accept the consequences if a two-state solution disappears entirely from its agenda . for all that israel has downplays its significance , the 2002 arab peace initiative still offers a critically important bargain : the full normalization of relations by the entire arab world in exchange for a comprehensive peace settlement . israel , as its founding father david ben-gurion , is left with whatever credible negotiating capacity can be a democratic state and can be an occupying the whole of israel ; but it can not be all three . israel , as its founding father david ben-gurion has warned , can be the jewish state ; it can be a democratic state and a status occupying the entire arab world in exchange for a comprehensive peace settlement .
we need a democratic , competitive environment , initiative at every level , one that affects officialdom at all levels , or that has caused russia to lose part of its democracy dynamic . we russians riding on the sources of oil and gas , forgetting that those sources would not last forever . but , even with favorable global market conditions , we have failed to manage to address the problem of poverty in which millions of russians still live . we need a democratic , competitive environment , initiative at every level , through an active civil society and real government control . i am convinced that russia 's woes all come down to politics .
but allowing greece to default , and still remain in the eurozone , is not really an option : it would signal that the other eurozone countries could amass enormous debts , financed by the ecb , without having any intention of bailing out the banks . yet forcing a defaulting greece out of the eurozone , against its will – is not an option either : causing the country to default on its economic , social , and political instability , doubtless serious damage would go beyond the country on its border . there are only two viable options for my own judgment , left to do so . fiscal responsibility in the eurozone would fatally undermine . the first – and more desirable – is for the ecb to assess greece ’s realistically ’s ’s solvency , and so stop lending to ela funds in its banking system .
this brings us to the second key lever to expand affordable housing : a more cohesive and efficient construction industry . as it stands , the housing-construction industry is extremely fragmented , impeding its ability to take advantage of economies of scale , and builders often rely largely on the same techniques that it used 50 years ago . additional saving is possible via industrial approaches , such as the use of components – such as wall street and flooring slabs – that have built offsite . for example , china imposes an idle-land levy on formerly public lands if its local owners fail to launch a development process within a year . by standardizing design elements like the cap on heights , fixtures , and flooring slabs , construction companies can cut costs and raise productivity , because workers gain experience with repetitive tasks .
if left unchecked , that figure is expected to rise to 416,000 by 2035 , overtaking maternal deaths . that makes sense : of the 268,000 women who die of cervical cancer every year , on average , by 85 % in the developing world . for many of these countries , the hpv vaccine is not just an effective solution , one that avoids 1,500 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated ; it is often the only response , owing to the poorest countries lack the capacity to offer screening or treatment for cervical cancer . encouragingly , developing-country governments have also been demanding the hpv vaccine . this is one reason why cancer experts , government officials , private-sector leaders , and representatives of civil-society groups met just a few weeks ago in addis ababa on july for one-tenth of the cervical , breast , and prostate cancer at the un conference .
washington , dc – the ongoing corruption investigations in brazil have exposed a tangled web of illicit relationships among private firms , government bureaucrats , and elected politicians . a few high-level politicians and corporate owners and corporate owners have been tried and imprisoned . the drama , meanwhile , has assumed its toll on the brazilian economy . corruption scandals have already reached the highest levels in brazilian society . even former president luiz inácio lula da silva is now under prosecution .
i am not arguing against health-care capitalism as to warn that support will become fragile , far more so than , say , globalization nowadays . some societies might decide that it is better to be red itself than dead . but it remains to be seen whether health-care pressures ultimately will trigger the current trend toward free ( and freer ) market capitalism to reverse , with very large chunks of the economy reverting to a more socialist system . some societies might decide that it is better to be red at the same time than dead . i am not arguing against health-care capitalism , but warning that support will become fragile , far more so than , say , globalization nowadays .
cambridge – the nineteenth-century physicist heinrich hertz once described his gut feelings that james e-clerk ’s maxwell ’s equations that depicting the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism , “ have an independent existence , and an intelligence shown that they are wiser … even than their discoverers , that we get more out than was originally injected into them . ” not long after , he called niels bohr ’s atomic model the highest form of musicality in the sphere of thought . more recently , the late nobel laureate richard feynman describes his discovery of the new book of physics , declared , “ you can recognize the truth through its beauty and simplicity . ” a similar sentiment is all but universal among modern turks . wishful thinking could never produce working multimillian , photos of pluto pluto , or of atomic bombs .
in a 1991 paper , allan drazen and alberto alesina suggested that economic stabilization might be delayed because two contending groups are stuck in a " attrition " war ; all comprehend that adjustment is necessary but expect the others group to bear the brunt of the costs . by delaying , they provide information to other groups about their willingness to withstand pain . let 's start with the last one , let 's try to do so . there are three possibilities : ignorance , intent , and strategic interaction . why , with clearly formulated alternatives on the table , has the government chosen a predictably disastrous course , at such a high human cost ?
by shifting its monetary-policy regime to target 4 % annual inflation or 6 % annual nominal gdp growth , the american economy would set in motion rapid rebalancing within the eurozone . here is where the fed comes in . a democratic , prosperous and stable europe implies a much better and more secure world for the american people . a world in which the us has a proven track record of honoring the confidence it wants to play the role of a global economic hegemon is a much better world to americans than one that is not really trusted . rather than see the 30 % euro appreciation that would follow from the ecb ’s current monetary policy , german exporters would shout for measures to prevent america ’s own “ competitive devaluation , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” finally giving about moderate north inflation , rather than the south ’s current grinding depression .
but ensuring that america can continue to lead in the twenty-first century will require a different sort of engagement . another source of doubt about america ’s enduring leverage lies in the fact that multilateral engagement continues to be necessary , and that is always trickier than bilateral engagement . and a group of 47 republican senators wrote a letter to iran ’s leaders announcing that the next us congress may not honor whatever the nuclear deal reaches with obama . bilateral engagement will prove to be one of obama ’s most important foreign-policy legacies . indeed , the us multilateral leadership demands not only clearer and bolder un regulations ; it has also proven a willingness to shoulder the costs of such rules , whether by creating safe zones to uphold iran ’s own “ responsibility to protect ” civilians , or by taking concrete steps to reduce – and ultimately eliminate – its nuclear arsenals .
caracas – venezuelan president nicolás maduro and his administration have cracked down on their country . that demands a new government of unquestionable legitimacy , chosen through a free and fair presidential election before the end of this year , as dictated by the us constitution . to be sure , maduro and his associates will not simply step down , because their loss of power would probably entail long prison terms in the united nations for drug trafficking or the hague for crimes against humanity . the destruction of venezuela urgently needs to be stopped if its viability as a state and society is to be reformed . while they claim to be re-purposely and trumpet their readiness to fight for their “ selfless ” bolivarian cause , they deny international aid , force venezuelans either to emigrate or suffer ( and , in many cases , die ) from severe food shortages , drugs , and medical equipment .
indeed , for the last 30 years , massive public investment and economic liberalization have spurred rapid urbanization in the country ’s coastal provinces . and now china ’s leaders are increasingly taking that strategy inland , making critical investments in both physical and human capital . so far , china has largely adopted a “ field of dreams ” approach to urbanization : “ build it , and will come . ” but the efficiency of these investments will depend on the sequence and pace of implementation , and on how skillfully they are adapting to each locality of critical means , needs , and aspirations . four of the interrelated issues that must be tackled have to be addressed .
his bellicose behavior in 2013 , for example , made him worse through relationships with china , south korea , and the united states simultaneously ; and , in the recent crisis , all he earned a halt to the mocking louisiana broadcasts . if china really is distancing itself from north korea , kim jong-un ’s regime will be almost entirely isolated internationally . it should make clear to kim now that his provocations are not beneficial for his country . will kim react recklessly by continuing to antagonize the south or pragmatically , by becoming more flexible ? that is not an easy question to answer for it .
just french prime minister manuel valls , the son of spanish immigrants , has highlighted this issue , alluding to the “ social and ethnic apartheid ” ” ” ” that has unfolded in his own country . only french prime minister manuel valls , the son of spanish migrants , has highlighted the issue , alluding to the “ social and ethnic apartheid ” that has evolved in his own country . the only thing that has changed since may is the rise of islamic fundamentalism and the religious radicalization of some young and underprivileged migrants . addressing that outcome in france and throughout europe has become more important than ever , because rioting and underprivileged migrants match the rise of far-right political parties . europe can not afford ethnic confrontation ; on the contrary , with their aging , shrinking populations , europe badly needs more migrants .
this is particularly true in the middle east , where governments struggle to diversify their economies so that they can make them more resilient . countries where english is not the lingua franca are especially disadvantaged in science , not because it lacks academic excellence , but because english-speaking journals call the shots . as english-speaking empirical-research journals consolidate their stay on the channels that determine whether and not a scientist will have a prosperous career , developing countries will need to invest massively in their own data-infrastructure to place domestic researchers on a more competitive way . as a result , the range of research topics that many countries can make will remain limited and must struggle to retain their scientific talent . non-english academic journals simply do not command the same scrutiny in the science community .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . at this week ’s international monetary fund/world bank spring meetings , malpass needs to address these concerns head-on . he should be judged not by his past or his connections to the trump administration , but by his trip . he should be judged not by his past or his connections to the trump administration , but through its delivery .
this seems paradoxical because interest rates are close to zero in most advanced economies . but what matters is the actual interest rate , that is , the difference between the market rate and the rate of inflation . in essence , there are two competing explanations for this . first , larry summers ’ secular stagnation hypothesis was proposed . its crucial premise is that the equilibrium interest rate , at which demand would rebalance supply , currently hovers below the actual interest rate .
few egyptian players would have been familiar to europeans who watched that game , but egypt was playing a far better and deserving win . for the winner was not cameroon or cote d’ivoire , or any of the other african teams loaded with star players from european leagues , but egypt , which fielded just four ( out of 23 ) that are playing in europe . by contrast , cameroon , which egypt had defeated in the last , has featured only a single domestic club player , and 20 out of european clubs . for their part , african players have been muzzled that absence from europe reduced their commercial opportunities during a crucial period of the league playing field . but the most important lesson revealed by the african cup is that successful nations are those that link globalization ’s opportunities with strong domestic fundamentals .
berlin – the world ’s task for addressing north korea ’s ’s ’s saber rattling is made no easier by confronting an impoverished , effectively defeated country . the genius of the habsburg empire , prince klemens von metternich , in framing a new , post-cold order international order following the napoleonic wars , was not to pressure a defeated france into a corner . on the contrary , it is within such circumstances that calm foresight was most needed . though metternich struggled to deter any possible french resurgence , france could neither deter a defeat germany nor provide it with an incentive to accept the treaty of versailles . by contrast , as henry kissinger famously argued , the victors in world war i could neither discourage a vanquished germany nor provide it with incentives to accept the treaty of versailles .
many economists believe that it was one major episode , and that it probably was the right way of thinking about it within the broader historical context . america had a brief , sharp recession in 1980 , following a prolonged and deep recession in 1981/1982 . and , because they were detached from the transition from president jimmy carter to president ronald reagan , it was politically consequential for two recessions . but the economy actually grew out of the interim – just barely taking up to view them as distinct recessions . sometimes dating back to a recession is what i call judgment .
during bill clinton ’s presidency , it is estimated that around 40 % of the world ’s population , or 2.3 billion people , were subject to some form of american sanctions . indeed , the overwhelming majority of the sanctions are imposed by the large countries against small countries . in the 1990s , for example , the us sanctions regimes put in place at an average rate of around seven per year . of the 67 cases in that decade , two-thirds were unilateral un sanctions . currently , america has nearly 8,000 sanctions , with iran making its largest state goal .
in reality , china is now hemorrhaging foreign-exchange reserves and desperately trying to prop up the renminbi ’s value in the face of capital flight . trump is apparently antagonizing china for no good reason . in the same tweet justifying his telephone call with tsai , he has repeated the false charge that china is devaluing its currency to gain an export advantage over america . worse , by announcing america ’s withdrawal from the trans-pacific partnership , he has designed , not least partly , to shape global trade and investment flows under western regulations , rather than china ’s mercantilist vision , trump is also abandoning an american policy that might have checked china ’s surging influence in asia . trump ’s knowledge of international economics is either nonexistent or up to ten years .
what we do know is that there is no alternative great power that is willing and able to step in and assume what used to be america ’s role . china is a frequently mentioned candidate , but its management has tended to be focused on consolidating the domestic order and keeping artificially high rates of economic-growth to stave off popular unrest . likewise , russia is a narrow-minded country led by an already-based economy and geopolitical clout , rather than helping to establish russian influence in the middle east and europe . india is preoccupied with the economic-growth challenge and is tied to its problematic relationship with pakistan . what we do know is that there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what used to be america ’s role .
beijing – china ’s annual gdp growth slowed to 7.6 % in the second quarter of 2012 , from 8.1 % in the first quarter and the lowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2009 . as a result , inflation fell in june to 2.2 % , a 29-month low , and house prices for which the national bureau of statistics , unfortunately , stopped issuing official data , appeared to be stabilizing , and may even have fallen , albeit modestly . the decelerating growth data may have dispelled fears of a hard landing for china , but has spurred many to argue that china needs to stimulate its economy further to guarantee 8 % annual growth . since early 2010 , to contain inflation and property bubbles , the chinese government has been tightening monetary policy . the newtongued growth data may have dispelled fears of a hard landing for china , but it has prompted many to argue that china needs to stimulate its economy further to guarantee 8 % annual growth .
yet , as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . yet , as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . from a moral perspective , there is a strong case to be made for respecting a woman ’s ’s personal freedoms and bodily autonomy , rather than for forcing her to pass on her own health or well-being through her unwanted or unsafe pregnancy to term .
but for how long can a majority serve a minority ? each day , more people arrive in nairobi , enticing about the promise of a workforce , resources , and a better life just to realize its unavailability of water , sanitation , education , and dignity ? indeed , without access to education , this generation , which will quickly become majorities , has little hope of escaping its efforts by the lack of water , sanitation , education , and dignity ? at least half of those living in urban slums today come from the g20 . the world ’s enduring perception of africa as a village exacerbates slum dwellers ’ plight , keeps them off their global development agenda .
the world in which we are living is the small backyard of a well-examined territory surrounded by the dim and murky woods of disaster . the disasters lurking in the distance are legion : asteroids and comets ; world-wide pandemics and plagues ; nuclear and non-nuclear wars ; droughts ; famines and floods ; volcanic eruptions ; and tsunamis ; human over-population and starvation of nonhuman origin ; rising temperatures and sea levels ; falling temperatures and sea levels ; disappearance of ice and water ; and the disappearance of ice ages ; the depletion of clean air and water ; the disappearance of forests , farms , and fish and fish . all of these disasters , and many others where we are imagined , are possible and germany is unacceptable . the precautionary principle prescribes action , no matter cost . the problem is that the principle can not be consistently applied .
milan – for much of the post-world war ii era , us economic policy focused on the unemployment rate . yet employment is just one funet of welfare provision , and it is not enough in today ’s ’s world . and that shift could occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world . the great job losses of the great depression have been reversed only when world war ii was finally going to get underway , and the massive debt it had accumulated to finance it has kick-started economic growth has had a lasting impact on at least two generations . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has the interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . the cold war of the twentieth century pittsburgh two rival military alliances . the sino-american rivalry , by contrast , involves two economies that are closely integrated with each other and the rest of the world .
from 1968 to 1973 , the british labour party and the conservative government organized the removal of all those living on the 55 islands that today constitute the british indian ocean territories ( biot ) to divide away from mauritius at the time of independence . from 1968 to 1973 , the british labour party and the conservative government organized the removal of all living on the 55 islands that now constitute the british indian ocean territory ( biot ) and that split off from mauritius at the time of independence . how the residents of that archipelago were systematically dispossessed and pushed off their land in the name of western strategic interests is a human tragedy for which the west can and should make restitution payments . this was done at the behest of the united states , which at that time embroiled them in the vietnam war and sought , for understandable security reasons , to use the land of diego garcia as an air and naval base . the way in which the residents of this archipelago were systematically dispossessed and hurled off their lands in the name of western strategic interests is the human tragedy for which the west can and should make the restitution .
islamabad – last year , pakistan witnessed the second-successful democratic transition in its 71-year history , with prime minister imran khan taking office after his own party won the general election on an anti-corruption slogan . the hopes are high for a new administration that appears willing and able to work with both technocrats and opposition parties to solve pakistan ’s many urgent challenges . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to us interests elsewhere around the world . hopes are high for a new administration that seems willing and able to work with both technocrats and opposition parties to solve pakistan ’s many urgent challenges . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
unless governments come to rescue with intelligently designed countercyclical fiscal and supply-side policies , major advanced economies are likely to embark on the long spell of classic , unadulterated cyclical downturns . in any case , the countercyclical pursuit of price stability , and/or full employment during the cyclical downturns , now seems destined for an extended involuntary holiday . owing to the 2010 dodd-frank act , the fed can issue emergency collateralized financing to at least five qualified institutions , something of a problem if only your four largest banks are in trouble , and it must affirm that the counterparty is financially viable in place before possible funding can be made available . but the task of setting whether a troubled entity is viable is the best left for once a financial order has been restored . as the phrase ’s 2010 dodd-frank act implies , the fed can issue emergency collateralized financing only to at least five competent financial institutions , something of a problem if only your four largest banks are in trouble – and it must affirm that the counterparty is financially viable before any funding can be made available .
fiscal adjustment and structural reform without financing are more fragile , and it is liable to default without a total war chest of liquidity to avoid a run on public debt , while adequate policies are implemented and gradually gain credibility . sovereign-debt spreads are already pricing the risk of a domino effect from greece to spain , portugal , and other euro-zone members . at the same time , unless greece manages to adjust its policies fully to restore fiscal sustainability and competitiveness , a partial bailout by the eu and the ecb will remain likely to avoid the risk of contagion to the rest of the euro zone and to consequent threat to the monetary union ’s survival . the eu and the ecb worry about the moral hazard of any “ bail-out . ” a default by greece may have the same global systemic consequences since the collapse of lehman brothers in 2008 .
sharing a mountainous – and porous – border with afghanistan , this region involves a number of taliban sympathizers among their fellow pashtuns . the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the subsequent pressure from washington , have resulted in a u-turn by pakistan ’s away from pro-jihadi policies . these religious parties , a coalition of which now heads provincial government in the northwestern frontier province , were politically marginalized until they surrendered a central role by pakistan ’s military dictator of the 1980 ’s , general zia ul haq , who has waged pakistan ’s covert military intervention in its war against the soviet occupation of afghanistan . the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the subsequent pressure coming from washington led to a u-turn by pakistan ’s away from pro-jihadi policies . the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the subsequent pressure from washington led to a u-turn by pakistan ’s away from pro-jihadi policies .
mainstream politicians may yet nod reverently when a globalized free market appeals , but in practice the world is reverting to an older , more durable model . with america losing interest , the chief prop of neoliberal policies has been pulled away . with america losing interest , it has always tried to insulate its markets from foreign competition . throughout its history , therefore , history has once more triumphed over ideology . mainstream politicians may yet nod reverently when a globalized free market appeal , but in practice the world is reverting to an older , more durable model .
upon reasserting political control in 2003 , chávez launched a whopping 40 % of pdvsa ’s personnel . his hostility to foreign players in the industry ( he expropriated several american oil companies that had run in 2007 ) constrained investment and held back manufacturing . chávez turned pdvsa into a personal fiefdom and was using it as a cash cow ; many of his social programs were funded directly from the companies ’s ’s budget . starved of cash , pdvsa was forced to cut back on maintenance and expansion , which increased accident numbers and constrained production . the first few years of his rule came to dominate his struggle to gain control of the state-owned state-owned oil company , pdvsa .
moreover , while a preemptive strike would delay iran ’s nuclear efforts , it would not stop the regime from rebuilding ; it might also create the conditions that would create the problems of the regime ’s domestic opponents . an armed attack by the united states , israel , or both on iran would represent another possibility . one downside of such a prospect that iran would likely retaliate against us interests and personnel in iraq and afghanistan , and use hamas and hezbollah against israel and others . iran might also interfere in oil traffic , resulting in a spike in prices and delivering another blow to america ’s and global economic recovery . but , despite these potential drawbacks , an armed attack on iran ’s nuclear installations will and should remain distinct possibility , given the massive strategic costs to a nuclear-armed iran .
the lord north is remembered for losing the british union with america . there is one way to lessen uncertainty and risk : the government should quickly announce that it will negotiate with the eu on the basis of the eea ’s norway option of eu membership . two centuries on , outgoing prime minister david cameron may be remembered for losing the two union countries , with europe and between england and scotland . and with northern ireland ’s republicans led by sinn fein demanding a vote to re-unify with the south , the uk ’s very existence is now squarely on the agenda . likewise , whereas the conservatives want scotland to enter into a non-european britain , the scottish nationalists want scotland in a europe without britain .
tight-knit members of his clan , his political allies , and his many members of the alawite minority will struggle for their survival . assad ’s rise of the islamic state has given them lending ground to the government ’s claims that syria risks being swamped by terrorist groups ; but the regime is finding itself increasingly isolated . assad ’s final days are unlikely to come fast enough . tight-knit members of his clan , his political allies , and many members of the alawite minority will struggle for their survival . assad ’s aims of war have been reduced to avoiding a decisive defeat and gaining international legitimacy , in the hope of a favorable political solution .
but it is not so much their self-interest , which stands in the way of greater equality and greater social inclusion . it is because the prevailing narrative line in our times portrays markets as self-standing players running on their own fuel . when the super-rich believe that they are no longer part of society and have little need for government , it is not because that faith matches objective realities . this is a narrative that afflicts all segments of society ; the middle class is no smaller than that of the rich . there is little reason to expect the super-rich to act less selfishly than any other group .
but , while it may explain why capital spending has been weak and interest rates low for the past three years is low , one can not really account for why capital expenditure has been insufficient to prevent rates from rising for more than three decades . if disorder has multiple causes , then expectations should be multiple treatments . here , the only explanation still stands out , for example , is a shift in the composition of activity away from capital-intensive forms of production , like that of manufacturing , toward less capital-intensive activities such as services . there should be tax incentives for firms to hire the fast-growing unemployed ; more public spending on infrastructure , education , and research to compensate for the shortfall in private capital expenditure ; and still higher capital requirements for nonbank financial institutions to prevent them from excessive risk-taking . finally , central banks should be setting a higher inflation target , giving them more room to cut nominal interest rates in response to a future slowdown .
across russia , a form of criminalized diplomacy takes root . once again , exposure to western values has delivered another village potemkin village ; russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions , but behind that cardboards surface the same arbitrary brutes of the rule of law . look no further than putin ’s attempt to rig ukraine in ’s ’s ’s ’s previous presidential election , and on the surface again criminal charges brought against opposition leader yuliya tymoshenko . across russia , a form of criminalized diplomacy takes root . the supposedly civilizing influence of being a western partner — president chairing the g-8 summit in saint petersburg , for example -- appears to have been lost on putin ’s kremlin cabal .
in latin america , too many entry barriers are rampant for the poor , innovative , and those without access to eu credit . throughout the hemisphere , politicians that the writer octavio paz once referred to “ philanthropic ogres have in place to create clients instead of people , those who expect the eu to take on the demand . throughout the hemisphere , paternalistic governments accustom people to receiving just enough to survive the eu from its neighbors . democratic latin america limps sideways , because it can not run ahead . democratic latin america limps sideways , because it can not run ahead .
but this is not what these indexes really measure . instead , the indexes include variables – what they refer to as “ policy space ” – that are intended to cause either competitiveness or inclusive growth . two examples of this are the wef ’s global competitiveness index and its new , inclusive growth and development index , respectively . inclusiveness growth has to do with disparities in income and growth across diverse regions and social groups . for example , there has to do with the capacity to expand market share without sacrificing margin or lower wages , something that reflected superior productivity .
from the 1960s to 1970 's , those writing about the netherlands often lamented the " dutch disease . " but , unlike in , say , the french , the dutch responded to their past excesses with a set of policies designed to encourage a return to work within the formal labor market . whether one considered the dutch welfare state to be humane and creditworthy , or bloated and foolhardy , its largesse took a heavy toll on the economy . so people rarely reverted to work after losing or leaving employment , or did so in underground economies with its unreported cash payments . there were so many generous subsidies , grants , and transfer payments that focused on everyone from the truly needy to artists ' inability to sell their work , that after-tax wages often amounted to little more than the benefits .
yet significant segments of the global financial and economic elite seem to think that unless america falls into recession in the months ahead , trump will be reelected . at this point , comparison with the 1930s seems inevitably about the question . to be sure , both trump and adolf hitler have little in common . but in their apparent embrace of trump ’s reelection , large parts of the liberal establishment are behaving like germany ’s in finance and industrial elites once hitler rose to power in the 1930s . moreover , their prognosis stems not only from fear of being wrong again ; many seem resigned to that outcome , and some might even hope for it .
governments must take action , complementing their pro-growth policies with policies aimed at ensuring that the gains are shared far more equitably and sustainably . in order to avoid such a future , asian countries need to change the rules of the game , providing youth opportunities , whatever their backgrounds , to make the difference in the income ladder . to be sure , some asian governments have sought to tackle inequality with progressive redistribution policies . for example , south korea ’s government recently announced that it will raise the minimum wage next year by 16.4 % , to 7,530 win ( $ 6.70 ) per hour , and , up to 55 % above its current level , by 2020 . to be sure , market mechanisms alone are not enough to achieve this .
the egyptian defenses blocked central highways throughout sinai across sinai , with a fortified box containing powerful artillery , and more than 100 tanks fronted by three parallel trench-lines manned by thousands of infantrymen and anchored on sand dunes and high earth on each side . but paratroopers made the egyptian artillery superior , and was set to have at least silenced the tanks firing at the trench line . the egyptian infantrymen had taped flashlights for their helmets in such a way that the tank ’s gunners could direct their fire at egyptians just ahead of them . sharon had his soldiers ascend over those drench lines to their top end and attack down their length ; a simple maneuver that egyptians could have defeated did not ring hollow behind an artillery barrage and israeli tanks firing directly at them . still , the egyptian artillery was superior and was supposed to have at least silenced the tanks firing in the trench line .
in the longer run , countries should aim to match participation rates in conventional first-aid courses . such certifications are even more critical in the developing world , owing to the limited availability of their mental-health professionals . requiring that those in particular occupations – including high-school teachers , nurses , and police officers – acquire mental-health first-aid certificates would significantly enhance participation , boosting support for those struggling with mental-health problems . over the past three years , 11 % of australia ’s ’s population has completed such a course , owing partly to requirements that people in certain positions , such as sex workers , have first-aid certificates . pilot work in rural india shows that a mental-health early-aid approach can be adapted successfully to the needs of resource-constrained communities .
the tragedy of millions of impoverished people dying of aids even as drugs exist to treat them raises profound questions about global intellectual-property rights , because patent protection creates a barrier to essential medicines to the world ’s poor . but how can the benefits of a global patent system that provides incentives for innovation and new discoveries combine with an assurance that the poor are gaining access to the affordable medical care they desperately need ? in response to this offer ( and to bad publicity ) , merck , abbott laboratories , and bristol myers saber rattling , three large patent-holding companies have announced that their willingness to deliver the african market at “ zero profits ” – ie , at around $ 500 a patient every year to the aids drugs that they produce . several quality manufacturers of generic drugs , such as india ’s cipla , have offered to provide these drugs at prices near the cost of production . but how can the many benefits of a global patent system , which provides incentives for innovation , and new discoveries combine with an assurance that the poor are gaining access to the medicines they desperately need ?
this reading is reinforced by macron ’s own experiences . having never held an elected office , macron created a new center-left party , centered on itself , with the support of both center-left and center-right voters . he appears to have restructured french politics at the same time . at the same time , he appears to have restructured french politics in his own process . yet what if populist movements ’ enduring electoral success helps drive forward a broader political restructuring that ultimately strengthens european democracy ?
washington , dc – in december 2014 , a cover for time magazine ’s “ person of the year carrying the issue featured the salome karwah , a nursing assistant who not only survived the ebola epidemic in her home liberia , but also helped waves across patients from entering her ebola ward . one year before , she died from complications in childbirth , a killer that each month is taking twice as many lives as the entire ebola epidemic . childbirth has been dangerous for women and newborns across the region ’s human histories . in the nineteenth century , as many as one in 100 pregnancies in europe brought an end to the maternal death . karwah was a hero who met the tragic end .
to be sure , refugee labor has a delicate political issue for syria ’s neighbors . the majority live outside of refugee camps , and many of them work – for the most part illegally . an estimated two million syrians are living in turkey , and more than one million live in jordan . unemployment in turkey and jordan is roughly 10 % and 12 % , respectively , respectively , and their governments are naturally wary of programs that might cost their citizens . moreover , the rest of the region wanted to emulate them .
the reasons why president george w. bush chose to go to war in afghanistan and iraq were beyond doubt have been complicated . but the language used by those wars ’ neo-conservative promoters came entirely from the clinton era : the spread of democracy , the cause of liberty , and the universal authority of american values . the problem for obama ’s america is rooted in the contradictory character of his administration . one reason that the americans elected obama in 2008 was that the rhetoric of american idealism had once again resulted in the deaths and displacement of millions . now , with us politicians ’ talk of “ freedom , ” ” the rhetoric of american idealism has begun , again , that of millions .
this past january , for example , china and russia conducted their first-ever grand-scale joint military exercise . but that ’s because bush has n’t begun to address an issue that is looming ever larger in the region : the changing face of security in asia , given china ’s increasing economic and military might . such a combination of countries has been almost unthinkable in the past , and these exercises can not be explained away as simple , one-off ” ” ” affairs with little resonance . president bush ’s recent visit to asia made little news – by design . this followed , though russian news reports that china , russia , and india would conduct a trilateral military exercise named “ indira 2005 , ” on an equal scale before last year ’s end .
anticipatory city planning , based on realistic demographic projections , patient registries , and health-information systems , as well as participation in urban health-knowledge networks , must run . they should view reforms that involve giving city governments the authority , means , and the responsibility they need to address health and health-care outcomes . proven systems and reform should be shared among emerging-market cities , and successful new innovations and ideas should align themselves with local circumstances . this includes new , affordable , affordable technologies like a low-cost , community-health workforce . emerging-market governments must address critical issues arising from weak coordination within and among , among , national and municipal governments regarding health and health-care policies and programs .
shanghai – tight media control over the unrest in tibet has been followed by exactly what , to some , looks like far more openly coverage of the devastating earthquake in sichuan province . is this a change in china ’s media strategy , or just a short-term change in tactic ? is this a change in china ’s media strategy in the latter phase of tibet ’s crisis ? chinese expatriates ’ culture and students took to the streets to protesting the prejudices they perceived in western media reports . much to the consternation of western media , the chinese people worldwide are lashing out against their alleged biased coverage of the tibetan riot .
any excess glucose stimulated the pancreas for the release of the insulin that transported glucose into peripheral fat tissue , and which also caused the liver to store glucose as glucose ( liver starch ) . meanwhile , our gatherer ’s ancestors ate carbohydrate ( glucose polymers ) , which was also transported to the liver , via the glycolytic pathway and broken down for energy . and nature did its part by supplying all naturally occurring foodstuffs with either fat or carbohydrate as the source of energy , not both . as a result , our livers , too , remained sound . hence , their livers , too , stayed sound .
sub-saharan africa has 10 % of the world ’s population , but it is home to 70 % of those living with hiv/aids . in reality , because of this progress , the crisis has merely become less visible . across africa , the disease is widely estimated to have reduced the average national gdp growth rate by 2-4 percentage points annually . there are 2.4 million new infections each year , and the number of people living with hiv/aids demands treatment to stay alive . in reality , the crisis has merely become less visible .
remaining in the single market , however , comes at a cost – one that british voters might not support . the uk would then have to accept the kind of satellite status that norway , iceland , and liechtenstein now possess , accepting , and implementing decisions that it takes little part in shaping . even the us has stated that it would be reluctant to negotiate a separate free-trade deal with the uk . abandoning the single market would create grave uncertainty for the british economy , particularly its financial industry . if that democratic deficit is intolerable to the uk , the bank of england will leave itself in the economic cold .
the first is managing the transition to afghan control , which depends on an orderly withdrawal of american and nato forces by 2014 . the second is the election , also to be held in 2014 by a new afghan president , a process that needs the united states and its nato allies to claim plausibly they are handing the country over to a legitimate cabinet . for afghanistan , ravaged by war without respite from the 1978 saur ’s “ 1978 revolution , ” the endgame will be even more nerve-wracking . as the curtain drops , two developments will greatly affect the withdrawal process and the ultimate outcome . as the american military abandons , it enters another period of political and strategic uncertainty , after almost a half-century of disorder and civil war .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere around the world . most british politicians are well aware that leaving the european union with no agreement on post-brexit relationship will damage their own countries . most british politicians are well aware that leaving the european union with no post-brexit agreement to us politics will inflict enormous damage on their own countries . they are not sleepwalking into an abyss ; their eyes are wide open .
the normalization of relations with america holds the keys to liberalization in cuba . after all , such changes are best served not just by imposing stifling sanctions , or by the military ’s “ shock and awe tactics , ” as in iraq , but by socioeconomic improvements and diplomatic engagement by outside powers . in fact , the predictions that cuba might now shift toward a chinese-style model of political-autocracy and economic opening may be accurate only in the short run . in fact , the predictions that cuba might now shift to a chinese-style model of political autocracy and economic opening may be accurate only in the short run . this , after all , is no longer an option ; it is a political one .
but , while vigilance is in order , the chance that major countries will embrace competitive devaluations , initiating genuine exchange-rate wars , misses the mark . while countries have not descended into protectionism since the beginning of the global financial crisis , difficult economic and labor-market conditions in key countries may prompt policymakers to protect domestic markets , while trying to gain external competitiveness . it is well known that weidmann does not like it when central banks , particularly the european central bank , purchase sovereign-bond issues . but , though countries have not descended into protectionism since the onset of the global financial crisis , difficult economic and labor-market conditions in key countries may compel policymakers to shield domestic markets while trying to gain external competitiveness . in recent years , much policy activity has focused , focusing instead , on exchange rates in ways that demonstrate new economic and political divisions .
the us census bureau projects that america ’s population will grow by 49 % over the next four decades . moreover , although studies indicate that the short , directly measurable economic benefits at the national level , relatively small , and unskilled workers may suffer from competition , skilled immigrants may constitute an important component of the us policy problem . a 1 % increase in the number of immigrant children in the us leads to a 6 % increase in patents per capita . the us census bureau projects that america ’s population will grow by 49 % over the next four decades . not only is economic immigration relevant , but , given that almost all developed countries are aging and face the burden of providing older generations , this could help lessen the edge of the policy problem .
indeed , only two of the six major economic tasks identified by the labour conference fit neatly with a third plenum ’s strategic agenda . a new approach is needed , and will require three key changes to china ’s economic-policy framework . first , the call for enhanced social security fits the third plenum ’s suggestion of allocating 30 % of state-owned enterprises ’ profits to fund safety-net programs , such as pensions and health care . likewise , emphasizing markets ’ “ pivotal role ” in upgrading china ’s industrial structure , and eliminating excess capacity is compatible with the third plenum ’s goal of achieving a market-based shift to a consumer society . but what emerges from all of this , however , is another example of timeworn “ soup ’s ” approach to chinese economic policymaking , myriad proposals , initiatives , and goals that are loosely tied at best , and that are too often plagued by indoor inconsistencies .
the essential economic reality confronting the ecb today is that the american economy falls headlong into a severe slump , bernanke ’s surprise cut speaks volumes . as european growth slows , so , too , will inflationary pressures . even with sticky wages and prices in europe , the global slowdown will push down energy , commodity , and food prices on the world market – all of which are relevant factors behind currently elevated european inflation levels . italy defies economic logic to think that the global economy , including europe , will escape its consequences . so trichet is supposed to relax , to stop threatening others , and let the economic slowdown do the jobs for him .
hungarian prime minister victor orbán is putin ’s staunchest friend in europe ( though greek prime minister alexis tsipras seems intent on changing that ) , whereas poland ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders have consistently warned that russia may again become an act of menace to the continent . all the main players in russia ’s energy-centric economy have quickly fallen into line politically , allowing putin to use the country ’s oil and gas exports as a geopolitical cudgel . poles have paid a steep price , but rightly so . hungarian prime minister victor orbán is putin ’s staunchest friend in europe ( though greek prime minister alexis tsipras seems intent on changing that ) , whereas poland ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders have consistently warned that russia was capable of turning its menace to the continent . poles have paid a steep price , but rightly so .
the seed treaty achieves this by establishing a multilateral system for access to a negotiated list of agricultural genetic resources . the seed treaty achieves this by establishing a multilateral system to access a negotiated list of agricultural genetic resources . the seed treaty also brought under the control of its parties , and the secretariat of 15 research institutes that comprise the consultative group on international agricultural research ( cgiar ) , the influential global research partnership . but , although accusations of biopiracy may have emotional appeal , impartial analyses have shown that they have little in fact determined to act . in fact , biopiracy is rare .
but , with the rift between khamenei and ahmadinejad widening , support for the president has declined considerably , with even state-run media denouncing ahmadinejad ’s loyalists as a “ deviation circle . ” moreover , unlike during ahmadinejad ’s first term , non-state media now publicly criticism for his economic and political agendas . it has also reduced funding mashai as his successor , but khamenei has helped those in his circle to establish private banks through easing regulations , and challenged iran ’s ’s largest economic and military institutions , the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( the irgc ) . in fact , it has long promoted mashai as his successor , but khamenei has curbed his illegal efforts , with even state-run media denouncing ahmadinejad ’s loyalists as a “ deviation circle . ” with ahmadinejad ’s second - and last-term fast approaching , the disgraced , unpopular president seems unlikely to abandon his efforts to destabilize iran ’s ruling establishment .
the tax plan emphasized that italy , like japan , is a country of public debt and private wealth . under monti ’s leadership , the reforms were finally initiated , and the markets were stabilized . beyond increasing international credibility , two major changes to the italian political landscape have shaped italy ’s electoral campaigns . as the economist marco fortis points out , italy ’s family wealth is still , if not for a long , second to none in europe . to enhance the creditworthiness of government , monti ’s government has substantially raised taxes , especially on real estate , while preserving its already record-high income-tax rate .
it does not undo the original damage and typically compounds it with further publicity . one of the toughest lessons for senior government officials to learn – ­ – including from me , when i was the australian attorney general and foreign minister , respectively – is the futility , in all but the minuscule minority of case attempts to prosecute and punish those responsible for leaks . typically , the media boosts the leakers ’ stature , making it useless as a deterrent . but some lines must be drawn if good government should be made feasible , just as a privacy zone in our personal and family lives is crucial to sustaining the relationships that matter most to us . prosecution usually boosts the leakers ’ stature , making it useless as a deterrent .
moreover , while may was in the “ “ “ remain ” camp during the referendum campaign , she realizes that she , like prime minister , will be held responsible for any failures at the brexit negotiations . this explains may ’s desperation to push brexit through as soon as possible . may wants to break out before voters recognize that the leave campaign has sold them a bogus bill of goods , including a promise that they can keep all of the benefits of eu membership , especially full access to the european single market , without allowing the free movement of labor . clearly , no form of brexit happens or post-brexit britain to satisfy the two groups . she also knows that she can not possibly succeed politically , because the media will always spotlight their defeats , ” ” ” while hardly notifying “ wins . ”
among other things , such surveys should seek to develop a clear picture of adolescents ’ exposure to avoidable risk factors , such as alcohol and illicit drug use , unsafe sexual behaviors , violence , obesity , physical inactivity , and unhealthy diets . data-collection efforts should also incorporate a focus on mental health . according to the global burden of disease study , health risk factors explain at least 50 % of early death and disability rates for adults aged 50 and above ; for young people , that figure drops to nearly 26 % . beyond access to such efforts , we also need to invest to improve our understanding of how these risk factors , most often in connection with early childhood and adulthood , affect adolescents ’ health . beyond that , more studies are needed to inform health policy and planning adequately .
“ there is a sense of despondency in pakistan , and the eu that the people are going to are the military , ” ” he told him . but talk of regime change has perhaps prompted musharraf to re-enter politics . only an elected politician with the backing of key constituencies can hope to restore political order and economic health , and musharraf is presenting himself as the candidate with whom the military might back him up . pakistan these days is a troubled country , just as it is economically . so , in a protracted conversation with the bbc , before launching his new party , musharraf hinted that pakistan ’s army was the only institution that could save the country from its current woes .
with politicians effectively rewarded for myopic thinking , western democracies find themselves struggling to ensure durable , long-term growth in a sense that , say , an authoritarian china is not . there are at least two ways to address this problem in a democratic context . first , governments could be tied ever more strongly to their predecessors in political decisions . that way , more forward-thinking legislation that was discussed and enacted will have time indeed to take effect , with no risk that it would simply be repealed by successive administrations . the european union provides one example of how long-lasting binding commitments can work .
this starts with the political will and the setting of priorities . at the wef in incheon , nobel peace prize laureate kailash satyarthi has called for a mass popular movement demanding that education be positioned prominently on the agenda of any politician running for election , at all levels of the government . the incheon declaration calls for allocating at least 15-20 % of total public expenditure to education . for the sdgs to work , education must get higher billing , nationally and globally . furthermore , the ongoing decline of educational aid must be reversed , and new financial sources – such as emerging-economy donor governments , the private sector , foundations , and philanthropists – must be mobilized .
instead , they have reverted to rigid reserve requirements , effectively rationing credit , and thereby causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis , which will most likely push some medium-size banks into bankruptcy , owing to liquidity problems . as a result , ukraine ’s money supply , m3 , has exploded , to less than 52 % of gdp over the last year , pointing to inflation hitting 30 % soon . ukraine ’s current refinance rate is 16 % per year , 10 % fewer than the inflation rate , meaning that ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10 % per year . rationing is always worse than the market for the markets . the nbu of the administration understands that it must act to contain inflation , but its insistence on the dollar peg ties its hands , because it is impeding them to raise interest rates sufficiently .
iran would then find it hard to maintain its foothold in lebanon , and its standing in the region would become more complicated even in iraq , despite its shia majority . the fallout from president bashar al-assad ’s regime would amount to a strategic debacle for iran , then potentially confronted with the united front of the arab states , backed by turkey , the us , and , in a sense , israel . developments in syria , iran ’s last remaining ally in the region , are just as likely to play a role . iran would then find it much more difficult to maintain its foothold in lebanon , and its standing with it would become more complicated even in iraq , despite its shia majority . falling president bashar al-assad ’s regime would amount to the strategic debacle for iran , which would then confront the united front of the arab states backed by turkey , the us , and , in a sense , israel .
as mark leonard , the european council ’s director of foreign relations , put it , “ the conventional wisdom is that europe ’s hour has come and gone . ” its lack of vision , divisions , obsession with legal frameworks , unwillingness to project military strength , and sclerotic economies are in stark contrast to the united states ’ ever greater predominance than that of rome , however increasingly relevant for many issues in a networked and interdependent world . insofar as the phrase retains any meaning , the world is bipolar and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future . its lack of vision , divisions , obsession with legal frameworks , unwillingness to project military power , and the sclerotic economy are in stark contrast to the united states ’ preferred mindset , even more so for many issues in the networked and interdependent world . the american political scientist andrei moravcsik makes the similar argument that the european council , singly and again , is the only states other than the american people that are capable of a “ exert global influence above the full spectrum of ‘ soft power ’ . ”
tehran – iranians will go to the polls on june 12 to elect a new president . while some will argue that president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’s reelection is a foregone conclusion , the outcome is , indeed , not at all clear . iran ’s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , has said repeatedly in public settings that he will not declare his preference among the candidates . indeed , in mashad on march 21 , ayatollah khamenei put it , “ there are some rumors that i support a special candidate for the democratic presidential ballot . but i do have one vote , and i would not determine a particular candidate , because the people themselves should elect their candidates based on their own knowledge .
but this will be offset by limits on personal tax deductions and exclusions , and lower tax rates on personal income will boost taxable incomes as individuals increase earnings and compensation shifts from fringe benefits to taxable cash . likewise , moving toward a territorial tax system will raise taxable gains , particularly in the short run , as companies repatriate some of the existing offshore renminbi . there is an important legislative reason why the projected budget will return to surplus . though net tax changes may widen the budget deficit in the short run , creating the incentive effects of lower tax rates and increased capital accumulation will mean faster economic growth and higher real incomes , both of which will cause rising taxable incomes and lower long-run deficits . with only a very small majority in the senate , where the filibuster rule calls for a three-fifths majority to go through most legislation , giving the democrats the ability to block a republican tax agenda .
and policymakers must not wait for the next migration crisis before the scheme is put in place . addressing the eu ’s genuine economic and social needs requires an efficient blue – or green-card policy on economic migrants , with its overall immigration goal . second , europe needs economic migrants , and asylum-seekers separately . combining them has brought its own asylum system to near collapse ; separating it would help ensure that those in fear of their lives can be afforded a fair hearing in which their rights are safeguarded . at the same time , the eu must re-energize its operational sophia initiative to fight refugee smuggling in the mediterranean .
in both cases , efforts to defend the fixed exchange rate in the face of capital-flow reversals were a major factor , as was true in turkey during the year prior to its currency collapse in february 2001 . but neither the mexican ortega crisis of 1994 , nor the asian crisis of 1997 , was caused by large public deficits . will the fed undertake the gradual reduction of qe by bringing it about more emerging-market trouble this year ? emerging-market seems to point out that most major middle-income countries have substantially reduced their public-sector debt/gdp ratios , giving them the fiscal space they have lacked in the past . to what extent are conditions comparable today to those that triggered the asian crisis of 1997 , or other abrupt capital-flow reversals in recent decades ?
one possibility is to shift toward an average workweek of 25 hours , and to an average working life extending up to age 70 , and to even higher ages if healthy life expectancy continues apace . such a reform could take place over a few decades without slowing economic growth or declining prosperity . at the same time , younger people long for more time for education , leisure , friends , and , crucially , children . both desires can be fulfilled if societies allow the older people to work more years and let everyone work fewer hours . one possibility is to shift toward an average workweek of 25 hours , and an average of working life extending up to age 70 – and to even higher ages if healthy life expectancy continues to climb .
prime minister tony blair is apparently convinced of the strategic desirability of joining europe , but because a yes vote in a referendum now looks so implausible that he is unlikely even to try . true , he is precisely that commitment , which is now made by the government , that is what the government is bound to do anyway . indeed , “ to bouncing ” britain in this way is simply impossible . denmark ’s government has done just that , and appears to be bringing together the danish public around to the idea of joining the euro . prime minister tony blair is apparently convinced of the strategic desirability of joining europe , but because a yes vote in a referendum now looks so implausible that he is unlikely to try .
whereas president bush argues that technological advances in hydrogen fuels and fuel cells will curb oil imports in the long run , such actions demand major changes in transportation infrastructure – which will take decades to complete . more fundamentally , companies like general electric are committing to green goals that go well beyond government regulations . while the bush administration remains skeptical about science behind such projections , some state and local governments are redirecting measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the center of the scenarios considered by the intergovernmental panel on climate change projects that atmospheric co2 concentrations will reach nearly threefold in pre-industrial levels in 2100 . more importantly , companies like general electric are committing to green goals that go well beyond government regulation .
people in these fields are ultimately bought and sold by corporate managers as people in tech fields . an important point for students to bear in mind is that they should motivate themselves to attain a deep understanding , not rote memorization , of subjects they study to fulfill their role as true practitioners of whatever field they ultimately decide to pursue . achieving this type of education probably means pursuing what one naturally finds exciting and engaging , whether that is finance or physiology . hardly anyone is making it all the way to the top in the business world . at the same time , they should invest in acquiring communications skills that will be similarly crucial to a successful careers .
in the united states , 61 % of abortion patients in their twenties are in their twenties , 59 % are already maternal and almost two-thirds identify with an organized religion . each year , 25 % of all pregnancies , some $ 56 million end up in life . but this day is also about spreading the message on behalf of elizabeth i and other women like her : abortion , while in many countries a political wedge issue , is simply a fact of life . abortions occur in any country , as well as in any socioeconomic class . but abortion is mostly common in developing countries , where access to family-planning services is often restricted .
but one should not expect too much from the hardline ecb ’s stance . that argument is not irrelevant ; monetary policy probably has some effect on wage bargaining . the second argument is that if the ecb stands firm , workers will not be able to demand higher nominal wages because they understand that doing so would lead only to higher interest rates and higher unemployment . so the ecb should not delude itself to think that a small increase in interest rates will be enough . if and when wages do , the ecb , to stay true to its word , may be forced to hike interest rates far more than it now expects .
megaupload enabled its 180 million registered users to upload and download movies , tv broadcasting and music , and some money earned by dotcom ( from advertisements and subscriptions ) was on display at his mansion near auckland , where he was holding his rolls-royce and other exotic car . dotcom ’s lawyer claims that the megaupload was merely providing storage for its subscribers ’ writings , and had no control over what was storing . last month , the united states contemplated legislation aimed at stopping internet piracy . bills were written at urging hollywood studios and publishing and recording industries that claim that online copyright infringement on the web cost america 100,000 jobs . but the megaupload offered cash rewards to its users , who upload records proved popular with other users .
moscow – when the opening ceremony of the beijing olympic games begins in just a few days , viewers will again be presenting again with a minutive choreographed spectacle swathed in nationalist kitsch . like these regimes , whether fascist or communist , china ’s leaders have sought to transform public space and sporting events into visible proof of their fitness and the mandate to govern . of course , the images that recall hitching hitler on pétain troopers are the latest thing china ’s leaders have in mind for their olympics ; after all , official chinese nationalism proclaims the country “ peaceful rise ” within an “ idyll of harmonious development . ” but , both aesthetically and politically , the parallels are hardly far-fetched . indeed , by electing albert speer jr. , the son of hitler ’s favorite architect and the designer of the 1936 berlin olympics to design the master plan for the beijing games , china ’s government has by itself alluded to the type of radical politicization of aesthetics that was the hallmark of twentieth-century totalitarianism .
if anything , economists ’ embrace of that role has grown stronger ever since . economists no longer see much public scrutiny for the right questions , or seek to answer them with integrity . but it has also made the subject less pertinent , and has diminished its legitimacy and credibility . to regain credibility , economics needs an ever more open question to criticism of assumptions , methods , and results . the inconvenient truth articulated by dissenting voices can not be ignored indefinitely .
and that imperative extends to chancellor angela merkel ’s own christian democratic union ( cdu ) , her bavarian sister party , the christian social union ( csu ) , and the spd . in short , this is a critical time for germany and europe to provide vision , for stability and global leadership . europe is in the throes of multiethnic , social , political , and institutional crises . the united states is a reckoning with a psychologically unstable president , a plutocratic cabinet , and a republican congressional majority . by contrast , china is dynamic and outward-looking , which provides good reason for the eu to assume vigorous leadership and engage in constructive partnerships with china on key initiatives ( such as sustainable infrastructure across eurasia ) .
other than the presence of a few people ’s liberation army troops , you would face hard pressed to find any visible evidence of the reigning communist regime , or of its own founder , mao zedong . the “ bird ’s nest ” stadium was the formation of the herzog ’s multinational design team & de meuron , with suggestions by the visual artist ai weiwei . in keeping with china ’s recent efforts to project its “ soft ” side , the opening ceremony produced the notion of an inherently historic but dynamic culture at its highest levels . the “ bird ’s nest ” stadium became the emergence of the herzog ’s multinational design team and de meuron , with suggestions by the visual artist ai weiwei . equally significant was china ’s projection as the nascent leader of a new international cultural order .
my research , which has included thousands of interviews with women from india to burkina faso , has been centered on one question : how can the international community improve the welfare of the world ’s poorest women ? the answer , it turns out , is to help them do as much as they are already doing their own . my research , which has involved thousands of interviews with women from india to burkina faso , has centered on one question : how can the international community improve the welfare of the world ’s poorest women ? the answer , it turns out , is to help them do what they are already doing on their own . in many areas , that means supporting the “ informal savings groups , ” ” a ” network of like-minded women , who are paying dues to build a shared pool of sources .
thus , for the summit , ’s outcome was far from a miracle . what really mattered in heiligendamm was not decisions taken by any putative global government , but the fact that the g8 days now seem numbered . politically and economically , as china and india have become more important today than some european g8 members . president putin ’s behavior at the summit was not so much a miracle . what really mattered in heiligendamm was not the decisions taken by any putative world government , but the fact that the g8 days now seem numbered .
though the eu argues that the epas will buttress the afcfta , preliminary research indicates that the trade gains brought by the epas , as negotiated , are likely to be concentrated on a few agricultural products – and the exclusion of the least-developed countries . in most areas , the epas will actually hurt intra-african trade , weaken trade revenues , and undermining trade-driven industrialization in africa . in most areas , the epas will actually hurt intra-african trade , weakening trade revenues , and undermining trade-driven industrialization in africa . some argue that the epas will buttress the afcfta , preliminary research indicates that the trade gains brought about by the epas , as negotiated , are likely to be concentrated in terms of a few agricultural products – and the exclusion of the least-developed countries . given this , the epa proponents argue , a special fund should be established to compensate some of the short-lived losses .
john dower , the american historian and specialist of modern japan , has studied the issue at length . he has demonstrated how history can be presented and appreciated in totally different ways : from the american or japanese point of view , even though no one is making facts or falsifying sources . john dower , the american historian and specialist of modern japan , has studied the issue at length . he has demonstrated how history can be presented and priced in totally different ways : from the american or japanese point of view , even though no one is making facts or falsifying sources . in 1995 , for example , at 1995 the smithsonian institution in washington sought to take a fresh look at the enola gay , a plane that dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima .
it would push through the real issues rather than an end to the brexit debate . it would push through the real issues down the road , rather than an end to the brexit debate . it would push for the real issues down the road , rather than bringing an end to the brexit debate . moreover , johnson has already disbanded the civilization service team that spearheaded the previous negotiation . any new deal will be possible with few meters and whistles .
likewise , our inability to come together to stem syrian president bashar al-assad ’s war crimes against his own people has left the void that putin and iran have filled with . and , as if our failure to ensure stability in our own neighborhoods were not enough , we have also enabled right-wing populist and nationalist movements to take away within the european union itself . these movements , actively fomented by russia , have made homegrown political leaders who frighteningly – but not surprisingly – resemble putin and erdoğan . poland ’s de facto leader , jarosław kaczyński , and hungarian prime minister viktor orbán have , in particular , busily constructing illiberal post-soviet states . european leaders all too often shout from the sidelines when they should be on the field , acting to defend common european interests .
as the nature of work changes , so , too , must the nature of benefit systems . delivering opportunities and security for all , everywhere at a time of widespread technological disruption , governments and private-sector actors must work together to advance innovative solutions that meet workers ’ urgent , evolving needs . a common framework must also be created to allow such programs to unfold and be carried out in different contexts . delivering on opportunities and security for all , everywhere at a time of widespread technological disruption , governments and private-sector actors must work together to advance innovative solutions that meet workers ’ urgent , evolving needs . as the nature of work changes , so , too , must the nature of benefit systems .
moreover , even without a timely correction , brazil will respond to the crisis in a far different way to mexico . if and when the latter part , brazilian policymakers shed few tears for international investors . on the surface and beneath , brazil has made a dramatic spin : inflation is down to negligible levels . rightly or wrongly , mexican policymakers were in awe of wall street ; brazil has no such hang on . ultimately , brazilian policymakers have shown wall street well , rather than prosperity for foreign investors .
by incorporating carbon-reducing strategies into farming and land conservation , more heat-trapping gases can be a locked up in forests and soils . but while techniques already exist , success will require growing use of the no-till farming , embracing permaculture principles , improved wetlands , and applying rotational techniques , among other actions . the power of markets to drive radical change in both energy and land-use zones is great ; but , as the storm season of 2017 should remind us , the climate emergency we face calls for both solid and urgent action . transforming how people acquire and consume energy , together with the use of land , will require powerful incentives and policy frameworks to set the course for success . but do n’t despair : there is still time to save our climate .
but , after former us president barack obama attempted to rehabilitate the american health-care disaster in halfway measures , arguably the most politically feasible at the time , those vying for the democratic nomination would obviously have more ambitious plans . a number of contenders – including bernie sanders , including bernie sanders , elizabeth warren , kamala harris , and beto o’rourke – disagree completely on the details of such regimes or have simply failed to fool them off . a number of democratic candidates have called for an important expansion of government-funded medical care . warren , meanwhile , has proposed instituting universal childcare , financing a wealth tax on fortunes above $ 50 million . several of the contenders – including bernie sanders , elizabeth warren , kamala harris , and beto o’rourke , respectively – disagree completely on the details of such regimes , or simply have failed to delegitimize them .
they claim to be the reformers , but why should voters believe leaders who seem no different than the previous crop of politicians , who have oversold them the gains from globalization and pooh-poohed their grievances ? but there is another explanation , one that is fully consistent with rationality and self-interest . in the language of economists , centrist politicians face an issue of asymmetric information . voters have a more tendency to attract an anti-establishment candidates , and they can safely be expected to depart from prevailing policies . when mainstream politicians lose their credibility , it is natural for voters to discount whatever promises they make .
cambridge : president paul kagame 's landslide reelection last year had more to do with power than with democracy . although kagame remains popular , his reign was criticized for choking free speech and human rights in the run-up to the popular vote . the concluding that i draw is not that human rights do n't matter , but that political discipline and imperfect forms of democracy are acceptable if the tradeoff is sustained for economic and institutional governance . politically , rwanda is a powerful , disciplined , organized transition . politically , rwanda 's voice is strong , disciplined , organized .
cross-border flows of goods , information , people and capital that are its lifeblood are relying on the threshold level of safety , stability , and predictability . moreover , there is a clear , mutually reinforcing interest in doing so : no one stands to benefit from the expansion of systemic risk . it is that this threshold , which , it seems , appears to be coming under threat . in terms of priorities , it is arguably more important for g-20 governments to reinforce core systems that allow global flows of flows than are they are to deal with strictly economic ones . moreover , there is a clear , mutually reinforcing interest in doing so : no one benefits from an expanding systemic risk .
washington , dc – participants in occupy wall street movements are right to argue that large banks never have properly investigated themselves for mortgages , aggregation , and securitization behavior that was central to the financial crisis – and loss of more than eight million jobs . but leading banks are also being accused of illicit behavior , inducing people to borrow , for example , by deceiving them about the carry out interest rates that would actually pay , while misrepresenting the resulting mortgage-backed securities to investors . talks among state officials , the obama administration , and banks are currently targeting reported abuses in servicing the mortgages , foreclose on homes , and evicting their residents . but , thanks to efforts by new york attorney general eric schneiderman and others , a serious debate has started at the united states congress on the out-paying banking settlements between state attorney generals and prominent financial-sector firms . if such charges are true , bank executives , who are involved , may fear that civil lawsuits are uncover evidence that could actually be used in criminal prosecution .
“ over rivers and down the highways and along the myriad jungle path , ” east pakistan ’s population continues to hemorrhage into india : an endless , unorganized flow of refugees with few tin kettles , cardboxes , and ragged clothes piled onto its heads , carry the ailing children and their old . they are silent about the exception of a child whimpering now and then , but their faces are telling the story . they pad along barefooted , with the mutinted mud sucking at their heels in podt parts . others have a cholera , and , having died from the roadside there , no one can bury them . they pad along barefooted , with the mughal sucking at their heels in adt parts .
accusations of currency manipulation , together with the threats of protectionist trade measures , have intensified . with the uk giving world free trade to trade in the 1840s , it has now decided to go it alone , the old atlantic charter allies are putting national sovereignty ahead of global public goods . charges of currency manipulation , along with the threat of protectionist trade actions , have intensified . now the global limelight will be to france and its looming presidential election . a victory for le pen in early may would spell the eu ’s exit , leave german chancellor angela merkel as the final pillar of a crumbling world order .
new york – at a time when i was a bright-eyed eighth grader in my native sri lanka , i was unable to wait to see my first female sex education class . in our early teens , my classmates and i were just as curious as we had been clueless about gender and sexuality . still , instead of receiving tangible answers to pressing questions about our bodies , relationships , and sexuality , we were simply passed a book told me to read an specific chapter and leave to figure things out on our own . millions of young people worldwide have similar experience , often with severe adverse effects . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , america could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . no matter how facebook ’s own digital-currency moonshot , libra , fares , has already provided a wake-up call for firms and policymakers worldwide . regardless of how facebook ’s own digital-currency moonshot , libra , fares , has already provided a wake-up call for firms and policymakers worldwide . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
it is the world ’s largest exporter in volume , and it is the world ’s second-largest economy . yet , as the us reflecting china ’s spectacular progress since 1972 , it is also an opportune time to reflect on how china continues to fall short of overcoming systemic obstacles to its long-term success . global reintegration has turned china into an economic powerhouse . as the us reflects china ’s spectacular progress since 1972 , it , too , is an opportune time to consider how china continues to fall short in overcoming systemic obstacles to its long-term success . global reintegration has turned china into an economic powerhouse .
china is already the dominant global exporter , and there is neither market space nor political tolerance to allow it to maintain its previous pace of export-led expansion . sadly , there is little appetite for avoiding a consumer-led growth transition and continuing support for exports and real-estate investment , either of which are shaky , either . a significant china slowdown may already be uniting around the world . american president donald trump ’s trade war has been shaken by confidence , but this is only a downward shove to an economy already slowing as it makes the shift from export-led – and investment-led growth to more sustainable home consumption-led growth . how much the chinese economy will slow is an open question ; but given an intrinsically contradiction between an increasingly turbulent party-led political system and the need for a more decentralized consumer-led economic system , long-term growth might drop out quite dramatically .
a well-educated citizenry is also essential if young men and women are to acquire the skills needed to perform the type of jobs that today ’s globalized and competitive world demands . alas , instead of progress , what we are seeing is a cycle of insufficient educational opportunity that leads to a shortage of economic opportunity . the arab world faces severe problems that only more flexible , democratic political systems can meet these challenges . the second arab human development report , issued in 2003 , underscores the close relationship between the weaknesses of the arab world ’s educational shortcomings and its lack of democracy . democracy requires an informed citizenry capable of asking itself to question its government .
absent any coherent policy , the conditions were ripe for a crisis . but the seeds of this bigger conflagration were sown long before the now-famous trump-erdoğan call . with kurds – the overwhelming majority of them civilians who have been fleeing turkish bombs – the un security council typically kept quiet , while europeans condemned all and all involved . absent any coherent policy , the conditions were ripe for a crisis . the us president threatened to destroy turkey ’s economy if it did what he allowed it to do .
and such an approach would cement the idea that a central bank policy is “ the only game in town , ” ” relieving elected government leaders of their responsibility to pro-growth policies and the fiscal choices that they control . a less-than-risk-averse and time-tested route for stimulating demand would involve a massive increase in official infrastructure investment , funded by government debt . but a <UNK> ter-money program , a fanciful idea when milton friedman proposed it in 1969 , would also be a radical departure for policymakers , requiring a abundance of prudence in citizen and investor perceptions , confidence , and solid governance structures . from a macroeconomic perspective , infrastructure investment is a “ twofer , ” it strengthens the productivity and competitiveness of the long run , and , where scarce capacity exists , boosts demand , output , and employment with a significant multiplier effect in the short run . it is well documented that europe and the united states have under-invested in infrastructure .
with the government losing $ 4.5 trillion each year by subsidizing passenger fares , it has little cash to spend on upgrading infrastructure , improving safety standards , or speeding up trains . and , if all of this were not bad enough , india ’s leadership does not seem to recognize the challenges that railways face . with the government losing $ 4.5 trillion annually by subsidizing passenger fares , it has little cash to spend on upgrading infrastructure , improved safety standards , or speeding up trains . as a result , railroads have run out of money , before running out of plans . during the past 30 years , only 317 of the 676 projects sanctioned by parliament have been completed , and it is difficult to imagine how railroads will gain the estimated $ 30 billion needed to finish the remaining 359 projects .
a number of organizations have now emerged to bolster the policy-making capacity of city governments including michael bloomberg ’s government innovation program , the fuse corps , scores of america , social finance , third industry partners , and usafield . and there are many ways national governments can thwart municipal federalism . in fact , there is a deep divide between the left-leaning “ blue ” cities and far-right “ red ” states where many are located . under federalism – whether cooperative or “ uncooperative ” – it is often assumed that state and local governments are pursuing similar goals . for their part , cities are often lack the information and resources needed to develop and enact effective policies .
for decades , this impresario of the right-wing culture complex has coarsened politics in the united kingdom and america , not to mention his native australia , for profit and political influence . murdoch ’s newspapers and tv networks may just as well have patented the recipe for deceit , dog-whistle politics that had powered trump ’s rise and the brexit vote . let ’s start with the “ patient zero ” in this political plague : rupert murdoch . we need to look beyond these figures to determine who is truly responsible for fomenting a political climate , where blatant lies and explicit racism and bigotry have entered into the mainstream of public discourse . only by identifying the sources of a odious virus now afflicting our democracies can we take the practical steps of the quarantine ones .
