another aspect of the pivot involves moving further away from the middle east . but no amount of fancy footwork , whether pivoting or pirouetting , can lessen that region ’s importance . the middle east will remain a central pillar of world energy for decades to come . unlike east asia , the middle east remains a region mired in turmoil , the complexity of which defies an analytical consensus . do the region ’s crises stem from israel ’s lack of peace ?
this logic of deterrence produces a snowball effect . with russia and america holding 18,000 of the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s current stockpile of 19,000 nuclear weapons showing impossible to call for somebody of other nuclear-armed states to cut their own ( much smaller ) arsenals until the great two make further drastic cuts to theirs . china shares russia ’s ’s ’s ’s concerns about america ’s conventional and missile-defense supremacy , as well as growing and modernizing its estimated 240-weapon stockpile . with china taking this course , india – outside the npt , but with 100 arms of its own – feels the need to add up to its own arsenal . and pakistan then becomes even more resolute in trying to hold ahead in india .
two centuries later , that was no longer the case : by the late nineteenth century , the median standard of living in britain and other countries to which the industrial revolution had spread , for the first time in recorded history , light-years above any neo-malthusian benchmark of subsistence level . early industrial-era economic accomplishments occurred despite the loss of a substantial share of national income to support a corrupt , decadent , and a profligate aristocracy . they occurred despite a tripling of the population that laid extraordinary malthusian pressure on the economy ’s underlying natural-resource base , and , despite the mobilization of an unprecedented share of national income for almost a century of vigorous warfare against france , a powerhouse with three times britain ’s population . how , exactly , did these accomplishments occur ? what were the small differences that turned out to matter ?
the referendum ’s ’s ’s outcome has had little impact on the broader global landscape , and the implications for eu institutions are just another crisis to manage , rather than an existential implosion that london-centric britain newspapers dream . may is in no hurry to act ; nor is german chancellor angela merkel ( although she faced re-election next year , the increasingly desperate french president françois hollande says otherwise ) . may , who is as tight-lipped as cameron was an open ( if empty ) book , has already made the institutional skeleton of her political strategy . her government has forged an international trading ministry that will be responsible for drawing trade arrangements with the eu and the rest of the world ( the european commission had previously handled such arrangements ) . another new us department , the so-called brexit ministry , will manage political , court , and constitutional negotiations .
venezuela has tried to finance itself with help from the organization of china ’s development bank , which imposes some of the conditionality that imf bashers dislike . instead , the cdb lends itself to clandestine and corrupt terms , and with built-in privileges for chinese companies in areas like telecoms ( huawei ) , appliances ( haier ) , cars ( chery ) , and oil drilling ( ictv ) . the chinese have not demanded that venezuela do whatever it can to raise the probability of its regains creditworthiness . simply put , they want to demand more oil as collateral . whatever the imf ’s faults , the cdb is an embarrassment .
one television advertisement claimed it all about the low-rent cynicism of the tea party-driven campaign . it featured the two clips of obama said , “ “ i ’ve worked with the republican senator dick lugar to pass legislation , ” ” ” ” ” ” and “ what i got out of us senator dick lugar . the context was n’t made clear , but what obama said in full was this : “ i ’ve worked with the republican senator dick lugar to pass legislation that will secure and bring down some of the world ’s ’s deadliest , unguarded weapons , ” and “ “ “ what i was reached ” by us senator dick lugar to help lock down loose nuclear weapons . with lugar ’s defeat and the simultaneous exit of more recent republican moderates such as senator olympia snowe of maine snowe of maine to place national interests ahead of partisanship , the us senate is unlikely to produce the 60 votes needed to ratify further us-russia arms-control treaties . moreover , the comprehensive nuclear-test ban treaty ( ctbt ) to replace a fragile international moratorium can not come into force without american senate ratification .
perhaps it will be imprisoned for assisting terrorists , but its betrayal generates little resentment . indeed , secure states tend to forget about treason . insecure states are quicker , to sense acts of betrayal . the soviets , with their fragile legitimacy , have always feared a betrayal . they have labeled their crime izmena rodine – treachery of the motherland – commemorating this high moral language with minor transgressions , such as leaving the country illegally .
but there is no comparable protest against using antipsychotic drugs similarly enforced by people – and even used for torture prisoners . and , whereas few people now get ect involuntarily , and in all cases consent , a large and growing number of antipsychotic drugs under duvalitences , including among children , vulnerable adults , alzheimer ’s patients , and the host of others whose lives are shortened through therapy , with no effort to seek their consent . although ect ’s opponents believe that it causes brain damage , this is hard to prove . like antipsychotic drugs , antidepressant drugs , antidepressant drugs , and tranquilizers , ect has an instant organic effect . but , while ect rarely , if ever did , cause clear clinical evidence of brain damage , and has been shown not to do so in animal studies ; antipsychotic drugs regularly do so , under tardive dyskinesia , and other syndromes .
new york – trade negotiators in singapore have recently failed to finalize an agreement on the long-awaited trans-pacific partnership ; later , they will have yet another chance of completing what would be the world ’s largest regional free-trade deal . but , given serious concerns that the tpp will fail to consider important human-rights implications , this is no cause for celebration . the tpp negotiations involve the united states , canada , and the ten other indo-pacific rim countries with a combined annual output of about $ 26 trillion , or around 40 % of global gdp . their economic clout aligns with their aspirations ; talks go further than traditional trade issues , which account for just five of the 29 proposed chapters , and consider a broad range of investment and regulatory issues that will affect many millions of people – and not always positively . whether trade liberalization generally helps or harms the most vulnerable is a complicated question .
the exciting thing about open education is that free access is only a starting point . open education promises to turn the current textbook manufacturing pipeline into a vast , more dynamic knowledge ecosystem that lies in the rudiments of creation , invention , and improvement . open education promises to give children learning materials tailored to their individual needs , in contrast to today ’s “ off ” rack ” materials , together with quicker feedback loops that match learning outcomes more directly with content and improvements . and open education promises new approaches to collaborative learning that leverage social interactions among students and teachers around the world . late last year in cape town , we joined delegates from around the world to forge a consensus on open learning ’s ideals and approaches , and committed ourselves in a cape town open an education declaration that was officially released on january 22 .
what , in his view , are the boundaries for american engagement ? under what conditions would an american use of its own capabilities ? almost 70 years ago , after george orwell explored the tendencies on ambiguity , he offered the rather straightforward explanation that “ “ “ political speech and writings ” are , in large part , defending indefensible . ” in other words , hazy language is needed to obscure unsavory realities . massive violence against civilian populations is “ pacifying , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and ethnic cleansing aimed at “ simple transfers of populations .
brussels – for many westerners in the west , china appears to have gone from a country that keeps a cool head and maintains a low profile , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” in deng xiaoping ’s formulation , to one that loves a sound international bust-up . putting an australian mining executive behind bars for ten years , squeezing google , keeping the european union at bay for an important dialogue , and let a mid-level official wag his finger at us president barack obama at the copenhagen climate summit is not , after all , the best way to persuade partners of your constructive intentions . nor is it reassuring to remember that china , up to now , has steadfastly watering down sanctions on iran , investing in major offensive military systems , and pillorying western leaders for irresponsible finance policies and protectionism . but the point in reciting this litany does not seem so much to highlight china ’s wayward behavior , as it attests to a dilemma in which the country finds itself : whether it behaves like a “ normal ” normal ” force , the world will forget the many millions that it still needs to withdraw from poverty . the chinese leadership seems mindful of this dilemma , and does not really want to get dragged into ruthless competition with the west or its neighbors .
if this continues , europe would lose its sphere of influence in world affairs , and gradually become meaningless . fortunately , the experiences of the 1980s suggest a way forward . the international situation at that time was no less dangerous than it is today . still , we succeeded in ameliorating it – not only normalizing relations but ending the cold war confrontation on its own . this was accomplished mainly through dialogue .
these factors help to explain why the digital economy has given way to the large firms that have reduced the need for labor . and , once those firms are established and dominate their chosen markets , the new economy enables them to pursue anti-competitive measures that prevent both actual and potential rivals from challenging their positions . and , as economists david autor , david dorn , lawrence f. katz , and john van reenen show , america ’s industries with the fastest-growing market concentration at the same time saw the largest wage drop . this heightened market concentration is widening the chasm between firms owned by robot firms ( capital ) and those who are replacing robots ( labor ) . but confronting it will require us corporations to reinvent antitrust for the digital age .
and whom are we to thank for all of this european progress ? do we owe it to the wisdom of europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political leaders , particularly that of the “ merkozy ” strange couple of merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy ? unfortunately , progress resulted almost entirely from much-maligned financial markets . just as former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was brought down not by political opponents , but by jittery investors , it was markets , not european leaders , that opened the door to europe ’s fiscal and political union . that is no cause for celebration at all .
and , if multiple currencies all are slowing against the american dollar , the resulting impact on america ’s manufacturing industries could cause a weakening of the american economy , undermining its import demand , and thus harming the word ’s exporters . forecasts for america ’s economic growth have been revised downward considerably since the us federal reserve ’s interest-rate hike in december . depressed equity markets and falling bond yields worldwide in january 2016 thus illustrate the global nature of the problem that we face . demand remains depressed by a debt-hoarding overhang prior to 2008 . indeed , this pre-2008 debt did not gone off ; it was simply trickling down between sectors and countries .
paris – us president donald trump has shaken a transatlantic alliance that has long seemed unshakable . in a january interview , he labeled nato “ obsolete ” ” and the european union a “ “ “ “ vehicle ” for germany . ” the eu would soon collapse , he predicted , with the succession of nations following the united kingdom . the united states , its position indicates , would do more than fine . with trump , the world has become used for shocking pronouncements and shameless reversals .
those that survived so only barely , with considerably diminishing output going primarily to the ex-soviet market . russia has the know-how , skilled engineering , and an natural-resource base to become a global competitor in a wide range of major high-tech industries , including nuclear energy , commercial aviation , commercial space technology ( including satellites and gps ) , ict hardware and software , electric vehicles , high-speed rail , petrochemicals , and heavy appliances for mining and a hydrocarbon sector . all of these industries will benefit from the tremendous demand growth potential of large-scale markets like china , africa , and india . but achieving the long-term , globally led growth that high-tech industries are demanding a business environment that encourages private-sector investment , including openness to foreign players . moreover , a social and political environment must be conducive to a high-tech workforce , providing an attractive quality of life , ensuring civil liberties , and encouraging entrepreneurship and creativity .
to be sure , the situation is not being cut and dried up . a return to public-sector investment affects the presence or absence of complementary reforms , which vary from country to country . and there is some abuse potential , with expenditures being misclassified as investment . yet , in an environment of low long-term interest rates and deficient short-term aggregate demand ( implying little risk to crowding out the private sector ) , it is a mistake to relax investment fiscal constraints . in fact , the correct kind of public investment would probably spur more private-sector investment .
the central issue in such tv programs is not that the leading roles play by women . character , not gender , drives the narrative . outside the united states , women have already reached their highest levels in power . in germany , chancellor angela merkel , having won three general elections , is upholding or resented for her austerity policies , not for her gender . argentina ’s president cristina fernández de kirchner is under assault on mismanaging the economy , and america ’s banking interests to force debt restructurings in her country ’s creditors , not because they are a woman .
bernanke has stressed that the two policies are on separate tracks and will respond to different performance indicators in the economy . the us federal open market committee ( fomc ) , comprising fed governors and presidents of the regional federal reserve bank of england , has agreed that the federal funds rate will remain at its current near-zero level until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 % , and can be expected to remain there or declined further . with unemployment now at 7.6 % and falling only slowly , the fed might not be ready to raise its federal funds rate until 2015 . but there are caveats that forward guidance unambiguous – and thus uninformative . the fed warns that it could raise the federal funds rate if its envisioned annual inflation rate rises from its current level of just under 2 % to above 2.5 % .
and , with housing , health care , and education less readily available now than in the late 1980 ’s , his political program focuses on what should be done to improve russia ’s human capital – a key problem holding back russia ’s entire economy . according to prokhorov , productivity in russia stands at just 6-10 % of that in the us , which means that the economy struggles even when the price of oil , its main exports are peaking . indeed , two million educated professionals recently emigrated from russia . during the last two decades , social inequality rose threefold . to be sure , russia , prokhorov concludes , represents a feudal society , with putin ’s own political monopoly and economic mismanagement exacerbating the so-called “ natural-resource curse ” wreaking many oil-exporting countries .
what matters is that the united states ( ideally joined by other countries ) has allowed iran to know that any action aimed at placing itself in a field of nuclear weapons after 15 years , if not explicitly precluded by the accord , will not be tolerated . harsh sanctions should be reintroduced at the first sign that iran is preparing a post-jcpoa breakout ; this , too , is not precluding the accord . iran should likewise be made aware that america and its allies would commit a preemptive military strike should it appear to be attempting to present the world with a fait accompli . the world erred in enabling north korea to pass an arms threshold ; it should not make the same mistake again . meanwhile , a major effort must begin to assuage iran ’s own neighbors ’ fears , several of which are tempted to hedge their bets against iran ’s potential breakout in 15 years by pursuing its own nuclear programs .
short exchange-rate movements are no way to judge the currency ’s underlying strength . longer-term trends in how money is used internationally – especially as a store of value for foreign investors or for central banks – are far more telling . against the background of the years ahead , rather than just the next few weeks , trump ’s election will almost certainly be bad for greece . for starters , the dollar has shot up against the us dollar since the election only because trump has promised to articulate deep tax cuts and ramp up spending to decaying infrastructure and america ’s supposedly “ depleted ” military . this will boost near-term economic growth and , inevitably , put downward pressure on interest rates .
but that happy outlook for may rests on one crucial assumption : that the march 29 brexit deadline will remain unchanged . europe ’s leaders could easily neutralize may ’s threat of a no-deal brexit , and thus eliminate any need to offer the concessions she demands . to do this , they must understand the method behind may ’s maddening strategy of indecision and delay . throughout her political career , may has exploited procrastination as her winning strategy . as home secretary , she has often won battles against other ministers , simply by refusing to articulate her views , or even appearing at sessions until minutes before the final decision must be made .
and it ranks 58th for institutional quality , owing to excessive government regulation , opaque corporate governance , and political instability . finally , service-sector productivity amounts to only 45 % that of manufacturing , on average , compared to the oecd average of around 90 % . the problem is most acute in finance , real estate , business services , and communities , as well as government services . externally , south koreans are highly vulnerable to an escalating north korean nuclear threat . in recent months , north korea has fired multiple ballistic missiles and conducted its nuclear tests , spurring a exchange of incendiary campaign rhetoric among north korean leader kim jong-un and us president donald trump .
it is not sustainable for smolensk ’s people oblast to live under constitutional democracy , whereas grozny citizens and sukhumi are the victims of olivier ton shelling and destruction . the history of colonialism in western europe and japan , of american-style slavery shows that as liberal democratic ideals take root in a society , citizenship rights can not be denied to the colonial subjects of members or of particular groups . thus , as long as russia continues along the imperialist line , its democracy will come under threat . second , continued imperialism in near-abroad and in chechnya strengthens reactionary forces who oppose liberal democracy . the political and military elements that lament the demise of the soviet state fodder for the resources devoted to extending russian influence within the nato republics .
from a japanese perspective , an `` account of victimization '' took place in which `` atomic bombs became the symbol of a specific species of suffering -- rather akin to the holocaust for the jews . '' at the hiroshima museum itself , an role for the victim was exploited in ways that similarly distort memory . neither the japanese government 's responsibility for pressuring and continued war , nor the inhumane treatment that prisoners of war , or of the subject civilian populations they suffered under japan 's rule , are adequately acknowledged . all do choose the point that fits it best . whether to identify with heroes or victims , with airplane pilots sending an end to wwii or with a passive population subjected to the hell of atomic annihilation , we are always rooting with `` innocents '' and `` good guys . ''
the intended beneficiaries of such activism should be defined as rights-holders . accountability mechanisms should be established , allowing the victims to hold governments accountable for their failure to take action . this removes the stigma of charities and empowering for the victims . instead of being helped , because they have unsatisfied needs , remedies are accorded because their rights crumbles . the framework also should include indiscriminate requirement , ensuring that we turn our attention to some of the most vulnerable groups – not only the well-connected , literate , and regime ’s favorites , and not just groups for which quick wins may be reached .
the most important problem that needs to be addressed is not america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s massive bilateral trade deficit with china . it is that the chinese are stealing american firms ’ firms ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ technology , and taking advantage of it to help chinese firms compete with those same firms in china and around the world . the chinese are doing this in two ways . first , american firms that want to do business in china are obliged to have a chinese partner and share their technology with that firm . that compulsory sharing of technology makes it explicitly forbidden by the rules of the world trade organization .
this struggle within islam pits pluralism against purification . it is ripping countries and regions apart , deuring people to travel halfway around the world in order to join jihad , threatening to unleash more violence against muslims , just as it does against christianity , the jews , and others . but the battle within islam is not an entirely satisfactory or adequate explanation for the state of the anarchy that we see in a region like south sudan , whose 11 million people gained independence just over three years ago . although the newest newest country emerged out of the bitter civil war between christians and muslims , the independence referendum received 99 % support . yet today , 1.5 million of its citizens have been uprooted , who has nothing to do with islam and everything to make headway along ethnic lines for control of the country ’s resources .
in the us , the troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) , which former president george w. bush signed into law in october 2008 , started as a program by which the us treasury department purchased problematic , mostly mortgage-based assets directly from financial institutions . but this turned out to be more complicated than originally thought , and within weeks the us government simply recapitalized american banks . other misjudgments were not so easily reversed as a result . hoping to prevent a bank run , the irish government offered a blanket guarantee against all banking deposits . with that one unilateral decision , ireland destabilized the rest of europe .
hate speech and other forms of dangerous , illicit content must be attacked at the source . on one hand , increased media literacy is needed on the part of consumers who need to be taught , from a young age , about the real-world consequences of online hate speech . on the other side , and this is what the netzdg attempts to ensure – – – social-media platforms must ensure that their products are designed in ways that encourage responsible use . but this is no quick fix at all . on the contrary , it demands a fundamental rethink of business models , which facilitate and even reward hate speech .
regardless of what we are thinking about britain leaving the eu , one general and one particular specific to brexit may be asking . first , to what extent should the citizens of a democracy make their own choices directly , in a referendum , rather than through their elected representatives ? and , more precisely , should british legislators consider themselves as bound by the outcome of the june 23 referendum ? on the popular issue , the strongest argument for direct democracy is that it follows from the idea of democracy itself , subject only to a feasibility constraint . in earlier times , a small city-state might be outright democracies ; but in larger countries , where communication was slow to take the representatives to decide the many questions required to debate and vote .
they regard a back-door request in the same way that an automobile manufacturer would view the demand for a defective engine . a major technology coalition and civil-society groups recently sent a letter arguing against us president barack obama ’s argument against behind backdoors . in addition to “ undermining any american ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s own cybersecurity and nation ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic security , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” signers have argued , “ to introduce new vulnerability in order to weaken encrypted products in the us , as well as to undermine human rights and information security around the globe . what encryption supporters recognize is that “ if american companies retain the capacity to unlock their customers ’ ’ data and devices on request , governments other than the united states will demand equal access , too , and are emboldened to demand the same kind of capability from their domestic firms . america ’s government will not object , given its own policies .
kuala lumpur – malaysia ’s year-old government , led by prime minister mahathir mohamad , has suddenly found itself mired in a political scandal , following online circulation of sex video involving a cabinet minister and another man . weaponized sodomy charges are nothing new in malaysia , twice leading to the incarceration of people ’s justice party leader anwar ibrahim . unfortunately , the most recent drama , like those prior to it , obscuring more fundamental challenges . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
likewise , macron has signaled that he will pursue a pan-european campaign for the 2019 european parliament election . like a democrat , he believes that deepening europe must go hand in hand with developments in a truly european political space . at a time of much hand-wringing over the decline of liberalism , the future of social democracy , the rise of nationalism , and the backlash against globalization , macron ’s unapologetically internationalist posture is notable . in fact , macron has taken a leap into the unknown of the west ’s “ new politics , ” ” ” ” ” terrain no longer defined entirely by grand center-right and center-left competition . but is politics really turning the page around a traditional far-right cleavage ?
london – most pundits agree that the least misguided way for dealing with north korea ’s proposed nuclear-armed saber rattling is an ongoing combination of heavy-handed containment and aggressive diplomacy . fewer , he recognizes , though , that the least bad military option – one implied by us president donald trump ’s ’s insistence that china take responsibility for its dangerous neighbor – is the us-china invasion , or regime change enforced through china ’s own threat to launch one . that outcome , which would sharply shift east asia ’s asia strategic balance in favor of china , is not as unlikely as unlikely as most people seem to think . in fact , its very plausibility is one reason why it needs serious action , including by china ’s military planners . in trumpian terms , this is the “ “ china first ” option that could help to make china great again .
spiekermann , the global trafficking authority for targeted advertisements , political propaganda , public and private-sector surveillance , or other nefarious purposes , emphasizes the need to crack down on “ personal data markets . ” “ ever since the world economic forum started discussing personal data as a new asset class in 2011 , ” she told me , “ “ personal data markets ” have thrived on the notion that personal data may be the ‘ ‘ new ’ oil ’ of the digital economy , just as – and so it seems – of politics itself . as a result , “ more than 1,000 companies ” are now engaged in a digital information value chain that harvests data from any online business , and delivers targeted content to online or mobile users within roughly 36 seconds of their entry into the digital domain . nor is facebook and google , apple , or amazon , which harvesting and apply our data to whatever purposes might be considered , spiekermann says . “‘ data management platforms ’ ’ , ’ ’ ’ ’ such as those run by acxiom or oracle bluekai possess thousands of personal attributes and socio-psychology profiles of hundreds of millions of users
it gives the poor access to a broader range of commodities , while providing firms with more diverse choices regarding inputs . but increased trade can also eliminate low-skill factory jobs and drive down agricultural prices – outcomes that disproportionately hurt the poor . in india , for example , more rapid poverty reduction in areas where farmers face increased foreign competition . given cross-sectoral labor mobility constraints , stemming from skill acquisition barriers and rigid labor-market regulations , the poorest workers have few options when such changes occur . as a result , increased trade can demand difficult adjustments in the short term .
kenyans need similar means of reflection today . and yet , just when a country ’s democratic institutions could most benefit from such a mirror , those who have historically held it believes that they have no alternative but to put it down . for kenya , the very public decline of the nation came at a heavy cost . but it has also demonstrated that press freedom means much more than letting journalists say what they would like when they wanted and how they wanted . it also means holding media owners accountable to them .
the 2001 recession of 2001 combined an inventory downturn with an investment-led downturn . the first is now over ; the second -- the inflows of overinvestment in high tech and telecoms , the sectors that had been so important in the belgium boom of the late 180s -- may well last vastly longer . there remains a substantial capacity overhang -- for example , the fiber optic lines remaining dark , until now , saw any light pass through them . simply put , lowering interest rates did not and wo n’t , leading firms to invest more in those sectors . the good news -- and the really good -- is that the pace of technological change in these sectors is fast enough that much facilities may become obsolete before they are worn out or even used , enabling new investment to start faster than it otherwise would .
once a bureaucracy and a broad parameters for negotiation are established by early next year , may formally launch the withdrawal process by invoking article 50 of the treaty of lisbon . two years of negotiations ( longer if the eu agrees ) will follow . the three brexiteers , after fighting one another like rats in a sack , will need to come up with the eu packages . by that time , the next general election will not go far enough , providing a second stamp of approval for brexit . that , at least , is a formal brexit plan .
warsaw – in paris , west berlin , west berlin , london , and rome , the spring of 1968 was marked by student protests against the vietnam war . in warsaw , too , the students protesting , but their cause was not the same as their western counterparts . young poles took to the streets of warsaw not to chanate “ ho , ho , ho , ho , chi minh ” ” in solidarity with viet cong , but rather to defend their own countries ’s freedoms and culture against smothering communist rule . instead of chanting ho ’s name , the young poles poured flowers under adam mickiewicz ’s monument , the nineteenth-century poet whose drama forefathers eve , written in praise of the struggle for freedom , had recently been denounced as subversive and anti-soviet , as well as its performance in the national theater of warsaw . these are just a few of the differences between west and east european students in that springtime for forty years ago .
crucially , figures are comparable across a large set of middle – and low-income countries , as well as those available for advanced countries . preliminary conclusions emerging from these studies will illuminate political debates – and probably annoy ideologues of both the right and the far left . start , lustig argues in a recent paper with the failure of world income inequality . consider the gini coefficient , the most common measure of inequality that runs from zero ’s worth of perfect equality to $ 100 for perfect inequality ( one person receives all income ) . the average gini score ( not a weighted population ) in countries for which there is data declined slightly during the 2000-2010 period , from 39 to 38 .
likewise , while policies encouraging firms to raise wages raise household incomes and domestic consumption , wage increases can erode export competitiveness and choke off inflows of inward foreign direct investment . with rebalancing policies alone not likely to boost average output growth substantially , enhancing productivity is critical to china ’s own long-term prosperity . the final piece of the puzzle for china today is realism . as it stands , the chinese government is keen to sustain decent growth at around 7 % annually , while pushing for rebalancing and reform . the risk is that until reform measures take effect , the authorities can bet on short-term stimulus to meet growth targets , aggravating resource misallocation , and structural vulnerability .
and , by closing off such a prominent us-supported institution , he can send a message that nobody stands against him won . despots throughout history used the same tactic . but orbán does so within the eu in 2017 . it is worth recalling that to join the eu , hungary had to comply with stringent accession criteria , including credible democratic institutions and adherence to the rule of law . the fact that those high standards are now being systematically eroded has introduced a paradox for the eu .
soros : the ecb is a well-functioning institution . so long as it behaves within its jurisdiction , germany has no standing in any position to veto it . this is one reason why i am hopeful that something genuinely significant might emerge from the deliberations currently taking place behind closed doors . question : does you think that the current economic crisis is perhaps the last step in the more generally philosophical crisis of the west ? soros : i discussed this in 2000 in my book the crisis of global capitalism .
moreover , it is not as if a flat tax on capital gains will impede social mobility or boost poverty . indeed , since sweden adopted the same tax system in 1991 , its average annual productivity rate has increased by a factor of four . social mobility in france has not witnessed any major change since 1991 . by moving away from a university universal eligibility system to one that finds a more suitable fit for all college students after college , france stands to benefit from more genuine equality and greater social mobility . macron ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s revolution is on the move .
in addition to individual enterprises , entire value chains , which contribute heavily to a country ’s gdp , suffered an abrupt operational and financial freeze . but , while many observers have focused on major scandals of ’ own short-term political and economic fallout , it is worth recalling what brazil stands to gain by exposing corruption and punishing offenders . reforming the relationship between brazil ’s public and private sectors can improve countries ’ long-term economic performance . the ongoing prosecution has already altered the calculus of any economic agent thinking about violating public trust in private gain . there is now a widespread perception that those who engage in illicit dealings seem to have a higher probability of being captured and punished , regardless of their social status .
as the union races ahead , it seems that it has lost europeans along the road . many are turning their backs on the entire project . they have trouble watching what is common for europeans . they do not feel part of the large whole whole of the world . even in the new member states , enthusiasm for a european family of democracies is cooling .
these include trump ’s former national security adviser , michael flynn , who lied about his conversations with russia ’s ambassador during the transition ( presumably about the lifting of the sanctions imposed by us president barack obama on russian firms ) . moreover , president-elect donald trump , jr. , together with other top campaign officials , met at trump tower with a russian intelligence agent with ties to a kremlin promise “ dirt ” for clinton . it was widely expected that trump ’s ’s son would face impeachment , just – even donald , jr. , said so – but barr ’s announcement ruled by further prosecution . another prominent escapee from ’s special attorney general was trump ’s son-in-law , jared kushner , who is widely believed to have exploited his white house ’s role , particularly in us foreign policy ( in which he has had no experience ) to attend to his family ’s need for funding to pay off vast real-estate debt . trump himself remains vulnerable to the investigation initiated by or exiled to federal and state prosecutors outside washington .
backroom dealings and violence continue to rule the day . pundits argue that the arabs can not manage a democracy at all times . indeed , america and its allies simply do n’t like the outcome of an arab democracy that all too often generates governments that are nationalistic , anti-israel , islamist , and dangerous to america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s oil interests . when ballooning ballots in this direction , america simply ignores the election results ( as occurred in 2006 , when hamas won large majorities in the popular vote in gaza ) . the us can not halt the downward spiral of violence in the middle east .
cambridge : after a decade squandered , the world harks itself against an aids pandemic sweeping through the world ’s poorest countries , particularly in africa and south-asia . the pandemic has claimed 19 million lives , producing 13 million orphans . there are just 34 million more people living with an hiv virus that causes aids ; virtually all are marked by early death . while first identified in the americas in the early 1980s , aids is now concentrated in poor countries : 25 million people suffer from it in africa ; six million more in asia . in parts of south africa , more than 20 % of adults live .
in most cases , skies laws mirror those governing global oceans . oceans belong to all except those near the landmasses that are governed in a way similar to the country ’s land-bound borders . as a result , the sky is usually conceptualized . airliners and fighter planes operate within “ managed ” air close to earth , while nationality is designed to matter less well than the higher one goes . fragile treaties that cover this are enforced mostly by the fact that few nations can afford to post assets that high .
in fact , few other trends imply an even bigger threat to global stability . nearly all societies have become heavily reliant on the internet , the world ’s most important piece of infrastructure – and also the infrastructure upon which all other infrastructure relies . the so-called internet of things is an misnomer ; soon enough , it will be the “ internet of everything . ” and our current era is not the fourth industrial revolution ; it is the beginning of the digital age and the end of the industrial age entirely . the digital age has unleashed new vulnerability that hackers , cyber-criminals , and other malign actors are already routinely exploiting .
wto membership , too , will force the government to cease discriminating in favor of soes and against capital-intensive economic sectors , including in agriculture . china ’s pre-reform strategy rejected the notion of “ comparative advantage ” – the principle that an economy produces some goods more efficiently than others because of factors like natural resource , geography , and climate . jamaica , says , does not produce frozen salmon or hockey players , because investing in industries like citrus fruits and tourism delivers far more certain gains . a similar wto-induced secular adjustment underlies the decline of steel and textiles in advanced countries like the u.s. . in china , most soes survived because central planners emphasized economic autarky , regardless of cost .
there are also some who seem to be convinced that the eurozone ’s fiscal and monetary framework locks italy into weak nominal gdp growth , possibly at too-low inflation and high debt levels . yet , before the new government took office , italy ’s ’s ’s cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit – unlike its underlying debt position – was often rather restrained compared to the rest of the eurozone , as well as other g7 members ( canada , france , germany , italy , the united kingdom , and the united states ) . still , the mainstream political parties that governed italy until this year have failed to deliver the nominal gdp growth that the country needs . as a result , italians elected an unconventional coalition , whose agenda combines the populist left ’s policies with those of the populist right . while the league party promises tax cuts , the five star movement ( m5s ) pursues a form of core income .
encouraging foreign investment or verifying everything , and then waiting for things to get better , does n’t work . an effective strategy needs to accomplish two tasks : encourage investment in non-traditional areas , and pot projects and investments that fail . for this , governments need to deploy both the carrot and the stick . learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is the key challenge of economic development . the carrot is necessary because there is huge social value in discovering , for example , that gouging flowers , or soccer balls ; or computer software can be produced at low cost , because this knowledge can orient investments by other entrepreneurs .
combining these conservative assumptions about potential gdp with the cyclical rebound effect – an estimated 1.2 % annual rise in real gdp – would produce real gdp growth at an average annual rate of 2.6 % well above the 1.9 % level that prevailed in the decade ending in 2009 . but not all of the extra output produced over the next decade will remain within america . if the us trade deficit lowers by 3 % of gdp between now and the end of the decade , an implied rise in us exports and a decline in imports would reduce the output available for american consumption and investment by about 0.3 % per year . the effect of the us dollar ’s dollar decline over the coming decade could be equally important . if a truly trade-weighted value of the us dollar falls by 25 % over the coming decade , and the full effect of that dollar decline reflects us import prices , increased us import costs would reduce america ’s real incomes by about 0.4 % annually .
holdouts argued that if new bonds were being serviced in full ( as they are ) , the equal treatment required that holdouts should receive the full amount owed to them ( including not just interest but also principal ) . an american second circuit court of appeals ruled that argentina was bound to honor its holdout obligations at the same rate ( namely , 100 % ) as holders of exchange bonds . it was this kind of ruling that the us supreme court recently upheld . under the court-appointed order , argentina might not pay holders of new bonds unless it also pays holdouts , and no american financial institution would be able to serve as an intermediary to make payments to argentina . as a result , argentina must either pay the holdouts in full or default on new bonds .
indeed , china has now embarked on a $ 1.4-billion project to construct the drevelous complex roughly the size of monaco on reclaimed land in colombo – a “ port city ” that will become a major pause in china ’s anxi nautical “ road . ” zhou bo , an honorary fellow with the pla academy of military sciences , admits that china ’s mega-projects “ will fundamentally alter the political and economic landscape of the indian ocean ” while presenting china as a powerful yet benign “ power . ” this matters because the new asian order will be determined less by developments in east asia , where japan is determined to block china ’s rise than by events in the indian ocean , where china chipping away at india ’s longstanding dominance . to be sure , india is decidedly suspicious of china ’s behavior . but china is treading carefully enough that it can advance its goals without spooking its intended quarry .
yet sharif was an honored guest at modi ’s inauguration , exchanging gifts with india ’s newly affable leader . likewise , the modi government has adopted the upa-proposed goods and services tax , stalled by bjp-ruled opposition from bjp-ruled states ( including modi ’s own gujarat ) . and it reinforces the national anti-terror effort that modi had previously denounced as an assault on indian federalism . many modi ’s media supporters have already begun to decry the series of political humorations modi administered since his campaign . india ’s citizens who thought they voted for change are beginning to wonder whether the bjp has simply reprising the upa government ’s policies .
in all conflicts , human rights are among the first casualties , and , in the middle east , human-rights degradation has now undone the international conventions agreed over a number of generations . we should have looked at the helsinki process to demonstrate us how to the retrieve what was lost . with today ’s emphasis on military action in what has been called the “ war on terror , ” ” ” ” ” ” the need for a conference to discuss security and military matters , combined with the stability charter , has become urgent . a regional agenda must be designed to help identify priorities , based on a three-pronged strategy that includes energy and water policies , arms control , and debt reduction . europe ’s ’s contributions to the middle east have been great .
they did what they could have done to make sure that no meaningful reform was taking place during the crisis , with the recognition that momentum for reform would dissipate . they were more right than they recognized . who , after all , might have expected that bill clinton would follow an american president committed to undermining the multilateral system in all its manifestation ? for example , when the imf correctly suggested , after argentina ’s crisis that there was a need for a better path of debt restructuring ( an international bankruptcy procedure ) , america vetoed the initiative . when the oecd proposed an agreement to restrict bank secrecy , the bush administration vetoed that initiative , too .
bangkok – earlier this month , an estimated 100,000 hong kong residents assembled in victoria park to mark the 28th anniversary of china ’s violent repression of the pro-democracy protesters in beijing ’s tiananmen square . as the south china day post noted , the event in hong kong was the sole large-scale public commemoration of june 4 , 1989 , permitted on chinese soil . and , at the attendees , hong kong ’s demonstration reflected growing frustration , owing not only to china ’s own leaders , but also to their own . on the surface , little has changed since the united kingdom ’s return of hong kong to china 20 years ago . but , in reality , china now exercises near total control over hong kong ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s management .
what plays well with one group may not sit well with another . and , to be sustainably , a successful vision also needs to be an effective diagnosis of the circumstances that a group faces . leaders need to get that question right before proposing answers . to pick goals and articulate in a vision , they need not just to bestow it inputs from their followers , but also to understand the context of their choices . they need to be capable of assessing reality precisely .
sixth , the sanctions are being said to weaken targeted governments . but , by worsening trading and investment climate , economic sanctions are taking their toll mainly on the private sector . if anything , power becomes more centralized and concentrated as governments increasingly control the free supply of strategic commodities , given the constraints they cause . finally , sanctions are supposedly effective in containing nuclear proliferation . here , too , their track is demonstrably poor .
central and eastern europe after 1989 , although an intriguing reference point to the arab revolutions ’ analysts , was not an adequate reference point , because the region ’s ’s new domestic and foreign order resulted in a shift in external conditions stemming from the collapse of the soviet superpower . internally , almost all of these countries had an extremely clear idea about what they wanted : democracy , freedom , a market economy , and protection from the return of the soviet empire . they wanted the west , and their accession to nato and the european union had a reasonable rationale . nothing applies to the middle east ’s crises . no power anywhere , within or without a region , is willing and able to carry out barest visions of a new regional order – or even a vision for parts .
new haven – by now , it is an all-too-familiar drill . after an extended period of extraordinary monetary accommodation , the american federal reserve embarked on a long march backward toward normalization . it then took the first step toward returning its benchmark policy interest rate – the federal funds rate – to a level that imparts neither stimulus nor restraint to america ’s economy . a supermajority of financial-market participants would applaud this strategy . in fact , it is a dangerous mistake to do so .
the dangers for central banks stems from the failure to measure the implicit subsidies granted to major financial institutions in any given budget . moreover , the buildup of risk in a financial system that accompanies greater leverage is both hard to measure and likely to materialize only after several years ( following fed governor barack obama ’s tenure ) . de gregorio ’s views vary from that of many of his peers in other countries , because he sees clear risks in allowing banks to become larger and apply what he calls the “ smart ” ” ” strategies that require huge leverage . higher leverage creates macroeconomic risk – not least for the fiscal balances , when implicit guarantees must be kept in line . by keeping banks and other private-sector firms on lower debt levels , the vulnerability to shocks decreases .
new york – there has been no shortage of scrutiny of what russian president vladimir putin is up to them in syria , and why . much of the analysis , although narrowly focused on the short term , and may prove far too negative in evaluating its actions likely to long-run consequences . what we know is that putin chose to come to the aid of bashar al-assad ’s embattled regime . russia ’s bombs and missiles now harass on the array of armed groups fighting syrian government forces that gave the regime the breathing space that russia ’s intervention aimed at offering . as bad as assad ’s government gets , and as much it must answer for , that outcome is arguably preferable in the short run to the regime ’s collapse .
this may be interpreted broadly as part of a rules-based global trade framework . using exit data for 2017 , we find that the number of anti-dumping and countervailing ( anti-subsidy ) cases lodged by all wto member countries against exporting countries ( a log sitting on the vertical axis below ) tends to fall as exporter ’s income rises ( shown by a log ’s log on the horizontal axis ) . every blue dot on the graph represents the wto ’s member economy , with a solid black line showing the international average ( drawn from all member economies excluding china ) . the pattern of data is fairly clear : as a country becomes wealthier , there are fewer anti-subsidy , or anti-dumping cases against it . this could be because richer countries observe the rules better , thus attracting grievances as their labor costs rise or some combination .
most bets are on britain formally leave the eu in march 2019 , but “ temporarily ” remaining in the customs union , give it two or three years to negotiate a definitive divorce settlement . the brexiteers will scoff at such a “ soft ” exit , but they are likely to be sufficient to secure parliamentary approval . france ’s electoral decision to leave the eu will be revered , but its harsh economic consequences will be delayed : the triumph of pragmatism over ideology . if the brexit trajectory turns out to be this way , one will mark a good illustration of the twin features of politics and function . john maynard keynes put the matter quite well : “ words ought to be a bit wild , because they are an assault on thoughts of unthinking , ” he wrote in 1933 .
the atmosphere could not have been more frenzied : a former royal castle in the rolling hills of a taunus region near frankfurt , where statesmen and politicians held an annual meeting that dealt with the middle east . europeans and americans , israelis , and iranians , egyptians , and turks , palestinians , and tunisians rubbed shoulders . the novelty of this year was the presence of post-saddam iraq , among them the formal kurdish regional government , as well as the high representative of shi’a . a new situation in iraq , together with the middle east ’s road map , came at the center of attention . on march night , a senior german cabinet minister , himself deeply involved in middle eastern affairs , addressed both subjects , displaying great sensitivity both to israeli and palestinian concerns .
last friday , cairo was paralyzed , despite an almost-complete lack of coverage by local media outlets . and , indeed , ramadan – now underway – is mobilization-friendly . after sunset , a common program is emerging . observant muslims gather at sundown for iftar ( breakfast ) , followed by the evening prayers , tawarih ( longer prague ) , social interactions , qiyyyyam ( another late-night prayer ) , suhur ( yet another collective food ) , and then morning prayers . the final ten days of ramadan are i ‘ tikaf ( collective seclusion ) during which worshippers gather and spend nights in mosques and open spaces .
as africa ’s ’s ’s ’s lead development-finance institution , the african development bank will be supportive of our north african members , enhancing governance and institutions , reinforcing social-safety nets , and laying the groundwork for robust economic recovery . as we fund our infrastructure and other projects in the region , we will strive to integrate disenfranchised regions and rural areas . we are broadening our consultation with governments and other actors , cooperating more closely with national and regional civil-society groups and media , as well as with academic institutions , think tanks , labor unions , and industries and sectoral associations . with emerging democratic joan dispensation , we have partners with whom we can engage with governance issues . no country or region can indeed aspire to full , broad-based economic growth without pulling together all segments of its population , and without having a voice for all .
even many of the poorest countries seem to have joined in , posting robust growth on the back of rising energy and raw material prices , renewed mining investment from abroad , and rising fiscal revenues . although the numbers were never quite as rosy as market enthusiasts seem to have thought , they deflects attention from the shaky foundations of newfound prosperity . the growing need for sound global imbalances was met with disbelief by influential policymakers and market analysts alike : “ why change the win-win formula ? ” the fate of the rest of the world depends on answers to the unfolding financial tumult . the contraction of assets and stock markets will doubtless dampen american household borrowing and demand , potentially triggering a downward spiral .
manila – food shortages are a distant memory for many people in asia . but , as the region struggles to nourish and nourish a booming population , it could once again turn into an agonizing reality . asia is already the world ’s largest food market , with its population expected to grow to more than $ 5 billion by 2050 , up from 900 million today . owing to its expanding middle class , the region is likely to account for more than half of the global rise in annual beef and poultry production , and more than three quarters of the rise in fish consumption between now and 2030 . and , by that time , more than 60 % of total cereal demand in the developing world will come from south and east asia .
what america needs to be explained better to its own people why america should be involved more profoundly with the middle east ’s mounting problems . this is not to say that america should necessarily engage with every issue at all . but , whether america is acting or not needs a policy at all . syria is a case in point . the situation there , forecasting every pundit around , metastasized , risks becoming a full-blown regional civil war .
london – cybersecurity is one of the defining challenges of the digital age . everyone , from households to businesses to governments to the us , has a stake in protecting our era ’s most precious commodity : the data . the question now is how this can be accomplished . the scale of the challenge should not be underestimated . with attackers becoming increasingly agile and innovative , armed with an increasingly diverse array of weaponry , cyber-attacks occur at an accelerating pace , and with more sophistication than ever before .
this is not the only way forward . integrating migrants makes a lot more sense ; but it is desirable to help establish sustainable conditions in the troubled countries with the help of a generation of emigrating , which first transferred resources and then returns themselves back . many consequences follow from such home truths on immigration , not least a more rational debate . viewed from a perspective such truths provide , europe ’s eastward enlargement , for example , is highly desirable not , but because it may lead to migration from new member states to old ones . in this way , more portugals and isands can be formed as the wealth of already prosperous regions .
the costs are minuscule : reaching an estimated 80 % of the world ’s total of $ 140 million , or so undernourished children , would demand a commitment of some $ 60 million annually , with economic gains ultimately clear $ 1 billion per year . providing iron and iodized salt is another high investment . fortifying iron-fisted products at as little as $ 0.12 per person , a year . we know that iron deficiency leads to cognitive and developmental challenges . for $ 286 million , we could get iodized salt and fortified essential food items to 80 % of those in worst-affected areas , with benefits estimated at roughly nine-fold .
standardization and liberalization in european telecoms has underpinned 9 % wage growth and productivity growth over this period , compared to america ’s 6 % growth . the largest scope for renewed private investment is in the capital-intensive industries where the government has a leading presence as a regulator . even if european countries were to close just 10 % of the variation in capital stock per worker at the subsector level , the impact could be more than € 360 billion in additional investment – – offsetting the € 354 billion gap in private-sector investment between 2007 and 2011 . many projects , from airports to university campuses to university campuses to reap the benefits of returns over decades , implying that weak demand in the short run will have only a limited effect on their overall viability . even among more near-term projects , some – for example , retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient features – could become viable with action by policymakers .
as a result , the differential between growth in emerging and advanced economies has been aggregated by imf data , and including hong kong , singapore , south korea , and taiwan within an emerging-market group – has declined considerably . indeed , after averaging three percentage points for two decades , and rising to 4.8 percentage points in 2010 , the percentage-point differential fell to 2.5 last year , and is forecast to amount to just $ 1.5 this year . the question , then , is whether the rise differential will remain as low by today . those who believe that it will typically rely on three arguments , all of which require some qualification . first , they argue that much convergence has already occurred in manufacturing .
in practice , the proliferation of new safeguards introduced a high degree of moral hazard and created perverse incentives for governments and market players alike . under the most recent eurozone reforms , the principle that those who assume a risk should have been liable for it was superseded by a principle of common responsibility , implying financial transfers on an unprecedented scale in times of crisis . italy ’s current situation should serve as a warning to all of those advocating risk sharing . making matters worse , the sole focus on solidarity means that europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s real problems went unaddressed . these include high levels of public and private debt , weak institutions , over-regulated markets , and still-incomplete balance-sheet fixes on the part of corporations and banks .
a hoped-for brexit to break with the past did not materialize , because political infighting among the country ’s ’s ’s new leaders blocked implementation of any serious reform agenda . but 2004 also marked a bitter setback for russian president vladimir putin , who sought to entrench his favored presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych , to power in kyiv by promoting massive vote manipulation . the failure was a bitter blow to the kremlin , one that was neither forgiven nor forgotten . then came the orange revolution ’s failure in 2010 to power in a free and fair election , with putin choosing himself for a third presidential term in russia . creating a new eurasian union was a key part of his platform .
after the east asia crisis of 1997 came seven years of capital flight . the third cycle of inflows came in 2004-2011 , persisting even through the global financial crisis . if history repeats itself , now is the time for a third “ sudden stop ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” capital inflows into emerging markets . are a few data points and the biblical parable enough to take the 15-year cycle hypothesis seriously ? perhaps there is some degree of causal theory that might explain such a periodicity with international capital flows .
jefferson and madison did not want the countries ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s capital in the north , and hamilton grudgingly agreed to support move it to areas carved out of virginia or maryland . they , in turn , would secure votes for the federal government to assume and repay states ’ defaulted debts . a responsible fiscal state emerged from this grand compromise . despite massive costs – more than half of fledgling governments ’s expenditures in early years went to debt service – the us economy shook up the 1780 ’s depression and entered a growth boom . hamilton ’s task was both easier and harder than that of the us today .
digital-id could play an even more expansionary role in how individuals and institutions interact . digital id systems that succeed in driving high adoption could generate substantial economic value for individuals , businesses , and government alike . as we document in a new report , digital ids have the potential to cut rates of deception , cut customer onboarding costs , boost financial inclusion , and deepen savings , and under-banked credit . they can also spur development by enabling matching and streamlined employee verification , resulting in higher labor-market participation . digital ids could even establish a means to control data and digital footprints in an interconnected online system .
if the revolution continues apace , disconnects in incompetence , disillusionment , frenzied witch-hunts , and a recurring cycle of violent violence . but if the revolution aborted , its leaders unmasquerade as empty windbags . the first 1917 revolution toppled czar nicholas ii and produced a provisional government headed by socialist leader alexander kerensky , turned out to be a transitional blip . lenin described kerensky as the “ “ “ “ balalaika ” played by the old order to continue mad workers and peasants . ” but the second revolution – which brought lenin and the bolsheviks to power – produced a regime that was no less vulnerable to treachery accusations .
below it is an opportunity to create a single banking supervisor , combining the comptroller office functions , the office of thrift supervision , and the regulatory functions of regional february . in a perfect world , one would add to that of state banking regulators , but i recognize that at this point i began to trample on the cherished features of the american constitution ! this regulatory architecture would leave the fed free to talk openly about developing the financial system as a whole , without worrying about the implications for individual institutions in their care . the crisis showed that we need this kind of reasoning . moreover , such a solution would protect the fed ’s critical independence to its monetary-policy role .
in india , for example , there is the fear that tiny mom-and-pop retailers will be crushed as wal-mart enters the market in the coming months . but policymakers need to recognize that there are pathways to protect small retailers without stifling competition . the government can , say , impose zoning regulation , help small retailers find specialized niches in the market , or provide skills training for displaced workers . likewise , the survival of artisanal retailers should not be used as an excuse for introducing or banning business regulations that ultimately protect incumbent fortune . asian policymakers must remember how they successfully developed their manufacturing industries – through their competition .
toulouse – if history punishes those who fail to learn from it , financial history makes its punishing with a sadistic twist – it also punishes those who learn from it excessively enthusiastically . time and again , the financial crises reflected the vulnerabilities of the regulatory system established on the lesson learned from previous crises . today , ’s crisis is no exception ; nor will the next one . the postwar financial regulatory system was constructed on three supposed lessons from the 1930s . first , we believed that the primary reason why banks would go down is that depositors panic , not that the main reason depositors panic is that banks run into failure .
for china , the biggest such prize is the bilateral investment treaty ( bit ) . in a practical scenario , a us-china bit would make it easier for chinese firms to invest and operate in the us , boosting american firms ’ access to chinese markets . such an arrangement would be the near-term boon to xi , for it represents an american confidence vote in china ’s struggling economy . but the prospects for a little are dubious , at best . the american congress is deeply skeptical , and the american business community needs convincing action .
this is particularly interesting because it fundamentally refutes one of the harrowing scenes from al gore ’s film an inconvenient truth . in graphic detail , gore showed how a 20-meter sea-level rise would inundate much of florida , shanghai , and holland . the ipcc ’s report makes it clear that the exaggerations of this magnitude have no basis in science – although unambiguously fearful of people , and perhaps also will win gore ’s academy awards . the report also exposed another gore scenario : that global warming might make the gulf stream shut down , turning europe into new siberia . the ipcc simply and tersely tells us that this scenario , too , vividly portrayed in a hollywood movie the day after tomorrow , is regarded as “ unlikely ” .
it is important to note that china can still cut the bilateral trade surplus with any particular partner , despite its overall surplus with the us . and while import expo expo expands rather than decreases , a country ’s overall trade surplus may well have other benefits . for starters , lowering the cost of us imports will increase chinese households ’ purchasing power and access to goods that can improve their quality of life . likewise , chinese firms will benefit from a lower cost for foreign-made components and equipment , thereby boosting their global competitiveness – another channel through which lower import barriers can end up boosting us exports . ultimately , an international import expo will complement china ’s own market measures , including lower entry barriers for foreign financial firms .
throughout the west , many are questioning whether russia will continue to use natural gas as a means to place economic and political pressure on ukraine , georgian , and other countries in what the kremlin regards as its “ “ “ “ “ energy weapon ” near abroad . ” by using “ “ energy weapon , ” ” there is little more than a tactic : it lies at the heart of the prevailing doctrine guiding russian policy . russia ’s ’s ’s policies towards the post-soviet countries are rooted in the doctrine of a “ liberal empire , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” according to which russia ’s great government-owned and private companies should assume control over key economic actors across the territory of the former soviet republics by acquiring their assets . against this background , the word “ liberal ” should be understood to indicate that a “ new russia empire ” should be built through sheer economic means , excluding all forcible action against other nations . naturally , a key role in such a model gives way to post-soviet energy supplies .
cambridge – the united states congress is close to enacting a major tax reform . the plan ’s most important provision lowers the corporate-tax rate from 35 % to 20 % – from the top among all oecd countries to one of the lowest – and enables american companies to repatriate their foreign subsidiaries ’ profits without paying additional american taxes . regulatory opponents point to the resulting rise in the federal budget deficit , adding $ 1.5 trillion to us government debt in the next ten years . i dislike budget deficits , and i have long been warning about their dangerous effects . nonetheless , i am convinced that the economic benefits resulting from corporate-tax changes will outweigh the adverse effects of increased us debt .
we need a group of major economies , – to call it “ cog major ” – – – that announcing monetary policies in a coordinated fashion . to see why , consider the case of japan . japanese policymakers have good reason to attempt to support some inflation , and even correct some of the yen ’s secular appreciation over the past six or seven years . but , in today ’s more unilateral world , other central banks would soon respond by injecting liquidity , prompting the bank of japan to act again . such actions are typically warranted as policies for boosting domestic demand , but they end up fueling a surrogate currency war .
the gap in economic performance under democratic and republican presidents is in line and substantive terms , with disparities clearly above the threshold for statistical significance . princeton university economists alan blinder and mark watson confirm this democratic dividend in a recent study . their starting point is the observation that during the post-world war ii period ( from harry truman to barack obama ) , annual gdp growth averaged 4.3 % during democratic administrations , compared to just 2.5 % under republican presidents . should one return further , to include herbert hoover and franklin d. roosevelt , the disparity is even bigger . the results are similar , even if one assigns responsibility over the first three months – or the first couple of quarters – of president-elect donald trump ’s term to his predecessor .
terms in office have expired for being prosecutor-general , members of the national election commission , and supreme court justices ; but no successors have been named , because maduro has been reluctant to negotiate with the opposition , and lacks a two-thirds majority in the national assembly needed to nominate officials of his own choosing . venezuelans would like nothing better than they should be those who make decisions about their own destiny , but a democratic means to do so are resisted . indeed , one key opposition leader , leopoldo lópez , was arrested on ludicrous charges of “ inciting crime . ” it would have been preposterous telling ukraine ’s protesters to face government storm troopers , and bear it without any external solidarity or support . it is just as preposterous to tell venezuelan demonstrators alike .
true , far-left parties have also made advances since the post-crisis slump . history , however , suggests that the nationalists have the most to gain from episodes of political and social breakdown . it is easy to see why . classical socialism is the offspring of “ liberal internationalism ” to claim to be a globalizing creed ; in principle , it knows no national frontiers . still , in the face of large-scale economic crack-ups , internationalism becomes precisely the point .
london – “ “ “ “ “ “ what if that ’s ‘ as good as it gets ’ ? ” jack nicholson asks , because it stumbles through its psychiatrist ’s waiting room in the aeponymous film . at the recent g-20 finance ministers ’ meeting in shanghai , the participants asked a lot of the same question – and not just about the medium-term expectation of weak global growth . many now wonder whether china ’s current gdp growth rate will be as good as it gets a lot longer . determining the validity of such worries requires an understanding of what drives china ’s ’s ’s ’s economic slowdown .
at the same time , the internet disseminates the templates of what true democracy looks like – instantly and globally . not surprisingly , people are using this technologies in ways that indicate little interest in becoming cordoned off in conflicting and competing ethnicities , nation-states , or religious identity . overwhelmingly , they want simple democracy and economic self-determination . that agenda is in direct conflict with the interests of global capital and governments that have grown used to operate without citizen oversight . it is a conflict that can be expected to cement dramatically in 2012 , because protesters ’ agendas – from occupy wall street to occupying moscow – gain further cohesion .
but three of the european union ’s four largest economies – france , italy , and the united kingdom – all have large debts and annual deficits , which point to even higher debt-to-gdp ratios in the future . rising levels of national debt absorbs funds that would otherwise be available to fund productivity-enhancing business investment . businesses now fear that rising deficits lead to higher future taxes , further discouraging investment . that is an alarming prospect for all of them . when interest rates rise , as they surely must , the costs of servicing the debt will require higher future taxes , hurting economic incentives , and weakening economic activity .
they have pioneered new retail institutions , from the department of medicine to the box stores . the economy ’s fastest growing sectors since the late nineteenth century were those loosely categorized as “ service industries ” ; they often involve the diffusion of information and amusement – activity in which jews have been particularly prominent , from publishing to vaudeville and film to commercial sports . they have also tended to do disproportionately in learned occupations – such as medicine , law , and accounting – that are so central to a modern capitalist society . the fact that jews have been a long minority topic of discrimination sometimes bestowed as grounds for their propensity to dedicate to business in business , finance , and occupations . yet not all minorities long subject to discrimination necessarily succeed under conditions of market competition .
so far , sustainable infrastructure has been financed mostly by multilateral and national development banks ( mdbs and ndbs ) . crowding out of private capital will thus be the key to closing the investment gap . to help scale up the development and financing of sustainable infrastructure in low - and middle-income economies , we propose a new , holistic framework , developed by the one planet lab working group on financing sustainable infrastructure , of which one of us ( déséglise ) is another member . the framework , called “ “ vision ” for environmentally accountable transition – vert-infra ) , aims to help unlock project pipelines and develop sustainable infrastructure as an asset class , thereby opening the door to large-scale investment by institutional investors worldwide . vert-infra initially covers four subsectors of sustainable infrastructure : energy , energy storage , transportation , and buildings , with a heavy emphasis on city projects .
today , after the world financial and economic crisis ( and , in sharp contrast to 2001 ) , america seems to be weakened crucially . moreover , the new superpowers with their own interests – namely , china and india – have come onto the international scene . without the backing of china and india , america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s middle east policies may no longer succeed , but that support is given only half-heartedly – if at all . the success of american policy in this region holds very limited interests in beijing and new delhi , and europe is neither willing nor able to contribute to substantial aid . amid this tangled knot of regional wars , crises , and conflict , iran ’s nuclear aspirations look like a ticking time bomb – and a lot of new dynamite is accumulating across the region .
but this , too , is no longer the american story . creative destruction ( intensified by economic openness and technology ) sweeping the rest of the world . skeptics keep arguing that competition and technology wreak havoc on the harmony of societies ; that they create inequality and eviscerate the middle class . true , the new economy has a hard time sitting on its back sides and living at the expense of stockholders or taxpayers . true , it gives the opportunity to energetic people formerly on the sidelines .
chest x-rays for lung cancer and pap tests for cervical cancer have received a similar , if less definitive , critique . indeed , another step in the reappraisal of cervical cancer screening last year occurred at a time when researchers at the dartmouth institute of health policy announced that the costs of treating breast cancer were often minimized , and that the benefits were vastly exaggerated . indeed , even mammogram ( nearly $ 40 million are given annually in the americas ) that detects cancer does not necessarily save lives . dartmouth researchers found that , on average , an estimated 138,000 breast cancers detected annually in the americas , the test did not help 120,000-134,000 of afflicted women . cancers have either grown so slowly that they did not pose a problem or would be treated successfully if discovered clinically ( or were so aggressive that little could be done ) .
this matters because a rising population may be an even bigger problem than previously thought . a new study argues that there is now a 70 % chance that the world ’s population will not peak earlier this century and an 80 % chance that it will reach $ 9.6-12.3 billion by 2100 . sub-saharan africa – persistently the world ’s poorest region – will be its main demographic engine . fortunately , there is a cost-effective way to slow that engine of this : to improve women ’s access to modern contraception . providing contraception for an estimated $ 215 million women globally – a large share in africa that wants to avoid pregnancy costs around $ 3.6 billion annually .
state-owned enterprises , too , should be free to offer ; on the contrary , they receive no favors . indeed , the fundamental problem in iraq today does not lack jobs . in contrast to the mexican , chinese , or the russian revolutions , economic disenfranchisement is not driving the current conflict . this is a struggle for power , not for economic justice or a better life . uproot causes are political , sectarian , and personal .
on russia since its georgian invasion , obama and his running mate , joe biden ( who was the first member of the us congress to visit georgia following the us-led invasions ) , emphasize aid to georgia rebuild its economy , and maintain its own independence in the face of a continued russian-us campaign against it . mccain , by contrast , wants to punish russia through actions such as expelling it from the g8 . such actions may ultimately be necessary , but they will not help the georgian survive as an independent democracy . moreover , even after outrage in georgian territories , there are issues of common interest – such as energy , climate change , and iran – on which the west and the kremlin must work together . that was true even during the cold war , and remains true today , mccain seems unable to recognize it .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project protests asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
central authority is gradually eroding as the country continues along a splinter toward ethnic and sectarian regions , with the de facto kurdish sovereign state already well established in the north . in yemen , meanwhile , the possibility of adequate central authority slipping away as the country confronts several seemingly intractable problems – from internal divisions and separatist movements to al qaeda ’s franchise in the arabian peninsula and a faltering economy . southern ( aden ) and the east ( haqqaut ) are both on a trajectory toward independence , dragging yemen toward yet another secession struggle almost 25 years after the country ’s fragile unification . in libya , the collapse of colonel muammar el-qaddafi ’s regime has thrown the country into turmoil and decimated central-government authority . the south remains lawless , whereas the east is ruled by the benghazi regional council ; only the west remains subject to the ill-consolidated government in tripoli .
london – after the 2008 global financial crisis hit , a consensus emerged that the public sector held responsibility to bail out systemically vital banks and spur economic growth . but that consensus turned out to be short-lived , and soon the public sector ’s economic interventions came to be viewed as the root cause of the crisis and therefore needed to turn a reversal into reverse . this turned out to be a grave mistake in the short run . in europe , notably , governments got a taste for their extremely high debts , even when private-sector debt , not public borrowing , led to the collapse . many were instructed to introduce austerity , rather than stimulating growth with countercyclical policies .
we must combat exclusion from our own political parties , just as we are battling exclusion in our societies . this means welcoming migrants and minorities , creating more opportunity for women and disabilities , and empowering citizens through education and participation . empowering citizens means giving them both a power to make decisions and an informed choice . in pasok , the greek socialist party that i lead is being undertaking far-reaching reform in this direction . likewise , the goal of the socialist international is a world governed not by free markets but by free people .
indeed , europe could be able to bring down the eu altogether . moreover , unlike in europe , the united states is emerging as the developed world ’s strongest economy . american shale energy gave america an important competitive advantage in production overall and petrochemicals , particularly in the us . the us banking and the household sector made some progress toward deleveraging . quantitative easing has used to boost asset values .
still , by mid ’70s , when i first traveled to china during the cultural revolution , hardly a public surface was emblazoned with that slogan : “ down with american imperialism and its run dogs ” ( ” ) . although the chinese felt incensed by extraterritorial interference and domination , many also came to admire america for its own democracy , its openness , its energy , and its willingness to help . this skewed attitude meant that china tended to react in ways as contradictory as being impastically impasses and unforeseeable , particularly as its pride was piqued . nothing was more repugnant to china ’s new nationalists than to the idea of a weak and aggrieved china victimized by foreign exploitation . nothing provoked a more muscular reaction after mao came to power than the degrading prospect of feeling unable to resist foreign predation .
third , we are facing a steeply rising fossil-fuel prices , as developing countries ’ growth drives up demand and conventional supplies of coal , oil , and gas flaring . sure , we can find more fossil fuels , but at a much higher cost and a much greater environmental risk from industrial spills , wasteful product , leaks , and other harm . even the much-heralded shale-gas revolution has plenty of hype – akin to the gilets jaunes and stock bubbles of the past . shale-gas wells deplete far more rapidly than the conventional field do . and they are environmentally dirty to boot .
london – the united kingdom ’s ’s general election is slightly more than a month away , but already a campaign seems to have been with us perpetual , rolling implacably forward , but with little evidence of any genuine excitement – or even substantial – movement at the polls . indeed , support for the two main contenders – the labour party and the ruling conservative party – appears to be stuck in a low-to-mid 30s . conservatives are hoping that the government ’s record on the economy will persuade undecided voters to break in their favor at the very moment in the campaign . perhaps they are right things ; they deserve to be . meanwhile , labour seems hoping for a who-knows-what to turn the tide , while keeping its collective fingers crossed that they would not be eviscerated in scotland , where the scottish national party is threatening to sweep the boards .
is it really an american tradition not to be concerned about what will happen to others ? a second insight from psychological research summarized by bruce hood in his recent book the self illusion concerns the role of consciousness in decision-making . recent laboratory research shows that our conscious thinking devise , ex post , compelling rationales for many decisions that our brains tend to exercise inconsciously . former us president george w. bush , for example , might have opted to invade iraq and to topple saddam hussein for a variety of reasons : strategic advantages , humanitarian concerns , and even competition with his father . most did not involve the weapons of mass destruction .
other factors , besides trade policies , also matter . protection of property rights , civic and political liberties , protection from accidental violence , are among the other significant factors behind the promotion of economic growth . fiscal restraint as reflected in low government consumption relative to income growth also matters . geographic location also matters because such things as distance from markets , bad climates , and poor soil hinder economic growth in developing countries . but this makes implementing open trade policies all the more crucial , because they are the best tools available to compensate for the bad cards which nature deals .
durham , north carolina – my day begins with a coffee cup , ending with a hot chocolate cup . in between then , i consume a wide range of food and pharmaceuticals , including my daily 81 mg of the aspirin . a brightly colorful orchid enlivens my study and , through a window , captures the glimpse of my green garden . in short , my life , like everyone ’s – is permitted , enriched , and scaled up through a wide range of plant facilities and their derivatives . but the biodiversity upon which all us depend is under threat , because human activity beats forests and other plant-rich habitats .
ramallah – israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ’s decision to approve new jewish settlements on the eve of a possible settlement freeze is the latest round in a cycle that has echoed so many times in the last 40 years that it would seem mundane if not quite dangerous . the cycle goes something like this : american or international pressure mounts israel to halt settlement activities in the occupied territories . israeli settlers and their supporters then accumulate even more power in order to expand onto more palestinian land , build more exclusively jewish settlements , and destroy more arab homes before a so-called “ freeze ” arrives in effect . the peace process , not surprisingly , becomes a joke at the same time that this does . in the end , world pressure subsides and a freeze do not materialize .
san francisco : there is a big difference between the us federal reserve ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s mandate to maintain “ stable prices ” – as enunciated in the us federal reserve act – and the fed ’s ’s self-selected target of 2 % annual inflation . so how is it that policymakers have managed to substitute for the former ? a term “ stable ” prices is self-explanatory : a bundle of goods will cost the same ten , on average , between $ 50 and even a hundred years from now . on the other hand , if a country experiences 2 % annual inflation above a decade , the same items that $ 100 can buy today would cost $ 122 in the end of the decade . after 100 years , the price tag would be a whopping $ 724 .
as a liberal myself , i share those values , but recognize that insisting on them as a policy matter ultimately undermines migrants ’ interests . with vehemently anti-immigrant political forces gaining ground across europe , one must ask whether the arrivals desperate for a job are better served by being admitted on a conditional basis ( including , potentially , a limited period ) or not being admitted at all . skills-biased immigration fosters a similar dilemma . many in europe argue that this approach not only discriminates against the weakest migrant groups , but also leads to a brain drain from countries in need of highly skilled workers . but , again , one must also review the trade-off .
the eu ’s reforms were decreed high above , without having some grassroots support – and thus with no lasting durability . all , we were direct appeals to wall street and masses , rather than the encouragement of a genuine social consensus . such a direct method is the wellspring of authoritarianism . we need to recognize that and understand that it emerges not only when a apathetic or fearful public gets involved , but also at a time when there is no obvious stable advanced guard , such as powerful political parties that select leaders and control leaders . as a result , russia now confronts a situation in which a presidential election is the only political issue .
likewise , greece ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s rate is 49.3 % , but its per ratio stands at only 13 % . and the 20.8 % rate far exceeded the 8.7 % ratio . to be sure , a youth unemployment ratio of 13 % and 19 % does not seem to exemplify complacency . but , whereas the eurozone ’s youth unemployment rate has actually skyrocketed since 2009 , its share has remained the same ( though significantly above the pre-2008 level ) . during the 2006 french student protests , france ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s 22 % youth unemployment rate appeared to compare unfavorably with rates of 11 % and 12 % in the united kingdom , spain , and germany , respectively .
alternatively , china might end up being like a new supplier of reserve assets . in this scenario , the provision of a reserve asset would align itself with the world ’s ’s ’s fast-growing regions . such links could be direct if the renminbi acquires a reserve-currency status ; or , indirect , if the international monetary fund ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s unit of account , special drawing rights , becomes favored reserve asset , because the renminbi is now in the sdr basket . reserve status for the sdr is a long-held ambition , though the idea has never gained much traction . but there is a third possibility : global demand for america ’s reserve assets can subside .
trump has pledged to implement sweeping tax cuts , including a cut in the corporate-tax rate from 35 % to more than 15 % . add to that plans to subsidize infrastructure investment and increase military expenditures , and america seems likely to face surging fiscal deficits and massive short-run increases in demand . with america ’s economy already operating at close to full capacity ( at an annual rate below 5 % ) , higher imports – and a stronger american dollar – will need to meet that demand . all of this will bode well for europe , for which the us remains america ’s leading export market . but it is the peripheral countries that are likely to benefit most .
princeton – for the past century , economic-policy debates have been locked into orbit around the respective roles and virtues of state and market . does markets control the state , in the sense that it sets limits on governments ’ ability to borrow ? or does a state take charge when a market fails to perform socially essential functions – for example , fighting wars or maintaining full employment ? this old debate stands at the heart of today ’s profound divisions over how europe should respond to its debt crisis . a similar question is dividing american politics during the brexit referendum in november .
british negotiators would then respond to eu negotiators with a domino-theory logic by trying to make the process as painful for the rest of the eu . indeed , the uk ’s ’s ’s ’s “ leave ” constituency already firm belief that the uk would be better off on its own , and that brexit would hurt europeans far more than it hurts britons . this implies that the leave camp has a powerful incentive to fulfill its own prophecy . the other doom loop applies to the uk ’s homegrown political economy . britain can not simply start beating europeans back at its own game by reviving its auto industry or by making its own wine to rival french and italian manufacturers .
the excessive domestic demand that underpins this evolution is now gone , permanently . when deleveraging in the household sector is complete , domestic spending can rebound , but saving rates will not and should not return to zero . a fiscal stimulus in the form of back-deficit-reduction efforts might help to tide the economy over while the structural adjustment and expansion of competitiveness in the tradable sector advance . but , by itself , stimulus is not the answer , either . otherwise , the domestic demand shortfall would reassert itself as the stimulus ended .
so america ’s goal of regime change in baghdad does not look too bad , even though it can not be publicly supported . for president putin makes perfect sense to remain on the sidelines over iraq , at least for now , and to be repaid later for his help silence in the form of american influence on a successor iraqi regime concerning the repayment of russia ’s russian-us debts . if america ’s war in iraq fails , the situation will hardly be worse than it is now from a narrow standpoint in russia ’s interests , whereas the resulting mess will compound the problem for america and its traditional us allies , rather than for russia . the contrast between russia ’s handling of iran and iran underlines not only mr. putin ’s famous pragmatism , but the sophistication and adroitness of its policies . this contrast also reflects a crucial distinction between iran , an historic state of nations , and the artificial creation that is iraq .
kosovo ’s skepticism about serbia ’s democratic credentials derives mainly from the knowledge that conflict between kosovo and serbia is structural , not one based on one person . regardless of how much milosevic exacerbated tensions , its policies toward kosovo ’s ethnic albanians were genuinely popular among serbs . indeed , throughout the decade of yugoslavia ’s wars , serbia ’s attitude toward its minorities reflected a nationalist consensus in which the bulk of what was then the opposition took part . most of the kosovars would find talks to serbia about improved relations difficult unless serbia functions as some kind of de-nazification ” process . so far , president kostunica ’s refusal even to discuss putting an internationally indicted war criminals on trial is no less than a hopeful wife here .
in the end , economic sanctions compelled qaddafi to distance himself from international terror and make over megrahi – like yet another suspect , lamin fhima , who was later acquitted – to confront the scottish tribunal at cambridge in holland . but there have never been conclusive evidence that megrahi was implicated in lockerbie bombing . in fact , most experts still seem to believe that he was convicted using fraudulent evidence and that cia bribed witnesses . moreover , libya has formally accepted responsibility for bombing operations , agreeing to pay more than $ 2 billion to victims of ’ families , and abandon its weapons of weapons of mass destruction programs . yet , despite qaddafi ’s hope for a warmer embrace of western leaders ( and inflows of investment ) , the relationship has remained beset by mutual suspicion and frequent backsliding .
this experience has motivated it to establish its dangote academy , a center for talent development that aims to help fill the industrial-skills gap in nigeria and beyond . such initiative is crucial to aligning education with economic development and boosting prosperity . by 2040 , africa will have 1.1 billion working-age citizens – more than either in india or china . with the right education , skills , and job opportunities , this vast labor force could deliver rapid and sustainable economic growth for the entire region . without them , the continent has more to experience rising unemployment , widening inequality , social disorder , and , ultimately , conflict and chaos .
the husband of another young woman , aisha , cut off her nose and ears when she passes . the violence against women in afghanistan persists , for many reasons . first , the country inherited a repressive tribal tradition that presupposes the interests of women . as a result , women are deprived of their core rights and liberties . second , there is a powerful political incentive to deprive women of their rights .
entry into europe through economic and monetary union , however , aimed at inducing the political system to pursue longer-term goals , such as productivity growth and enhanced competitiveness . at first , events played out according to plan . during greece ’s eurozone accession period , from 1994 to 2001 , its economy stabilized . both inflation and the fiscal deficit fell fast ; firms and consumers became more confident ; investment picked up ; and the government placed on an ambitious liberalizing package . annual gdp growth jumped from -1.6 % in 1993 to more than 4 % in 1997 , and remained around that level until 2007 .
the european parliament , for its part , has already broadly supported such a move . momentum toward hfo phase-out in the arctic is building . danish shipowners ’ association and the arctic expeditionary forces cruise operator hurtigruten are just two of those players calling for tighter regulation or outright prohibition . other shipping companies have highlighted the need for regulations to keep a level playing field . in january 2017 , hurtigruten joined the clean-arctic alliance to launch a arctic commitment to launch an arctic commitment .
new york – john f. kennedy was quite a bit of both . he did one great thing : resolving the cuban missile crisis . and his gift to motivating people was unmatched ; indeed , it outlasted him , with his assassination cementing a powerful legacy . in africa , too , no great figure has emerged since south african president nelson mandela ’s death combined courage , authority , and magnanimity amid graceful abundance . indeed , he is among the most charismatic and charming leaders that i met ; another two – former united nations secretary of state kofi annan and former us secretary of state colin powell – is also african or african-american .
saint petersburg – the restoration of diplomatic relations between cuba and the united nations leaves out new prospects for israel 's economy . some steps , including the dismantling of america 's trade embargo , are forbidden by the helms-burton act , adopted by the american people 's congress in 1996 . but the revival of cuba ’s ’s ’s membership in the international monetary fund represents a real possibility . cuba was one of the imf 's 40 initial members . it engaged in much of the 1944 bretton woods conference and had an active delegation there .
it goes without saying that academic or engineering expertise is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure the success of government officials . indeed , many of my harvard colleagues would make appalling policymakers , owing to a lack of managerial , managerial , or other interpersonal skills . and many well-meaning political leaders – for example , george washington and dwight eisenhower – among us presidents have not been intellectuals . technocrats can play a useful role as honest brokers when traditional politicians have become disenfranchised nor parties are deadlocked . moreover , they have the credibility that comes with an inadequate desire to be reelected , either because their term in office was limited in advance , or because they are known to favor quiet academic life .
today , massive investment in critical infrastructure , industrial extension , and urban development are vital to accommodate an expanding global population , set to reach nine billion by 2050 – without adequate regard for disaster risk . in the absence of comprehensive conservation efforts to protect these new economic assets , disaster-related costs will skyrocket in the coming decades . in this sense , climate-change projections should challenge policymakers and business leaders to re-calibrate their perceptions of exposure and disaster risk . decision-makers must recognize that none of this as a natural catastrophe exists ; indeed , there is only the catastrophic impact of natural hazards on infrastructure , including workplaces , homes , roads , schools , and hospitals . following the 2004 indian ocean tsunami – which devastated one of the 11 countries ’ coastlines , resulting in more than 150,000 deaths , a half-million injured , and more than $ 10 billion in damages – 168 governments agreed to the hyogo framework for action ( hfa ) , a comprehensive ten-year plan for disaster risk reduction .
two years ago , nature ’s researchers and its partners published new research showcasing nature-based solutions ’ potential to combat climate change . yet natural climate solutions have continued to attract relatively little attention – and even less funding . fortunately , this may now be starting to change . in september , nature-based solutions featured prominently on the un climate week in new york city . while that event did not live up to un secretary-general antónio guterres ’s call for “ clear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions ” by 2020 , ” it offered a platform for a new generation of climate and nature advocates .
just a few weeks ago , the administration balked at admitting that rouhani fulfills his part of the nuclear deal . indeed , iranians ’ show of popular support for rouhani provided the best guarantee that the spirit behind the nuclear deal will remain unchanged . but trump will not make it easy for rouhani to do so . to ensure that iran continues progressing toward international engagement – thereby protecting the nuclear deal that trump is not anxious to defend – rouhani ’s administration will need to work hard to improve relations with neighboring countries . moreover , he will need to embrace a more constructive position vis-à-vis the syrian conflict , make it clear that iran does not spearheading the shia liberation movement .
ludicrous cases go forward , and more people are getting dragged into them . the mainstream independent media do not even report the inconsistencies of the fear of provoking a government or a network of gülen . these cases end up collapsing under the weight of their collective absurdity . but the damage done will extend far beyond the suffering of hundreds of innocent individuals cast under false retenses . the hope that turkey is finally shedding its authoritarian vestiges and becoming a stable democracy ends in tatters .
likewise , in july , the brics created a “ “ contingent reserve arrangement ” arrangement ” that would , it was argued , “ forestall short-term balance-of-payments pressures , provide mutually supportive , and further enhance financial stability . ” but russia is not likely to be able to draw upon this emergency credit line during the current crisis . more recently , chinese foreign minister wang yi pledged aid to russia . but his incontrovertible language reflected a greater hesitancy that probably will persist until the crisis comes to pass . in short , both the western-dominated governance mechanisms and the brics have veered toward russia .
they will also attempt to lower japan ’s trade dependence on exports and rethink sending production facilities to the lower-wage countries . america ’s economic impact on policy , while important , will become less dynamic : absent a more cooperative us congress , policy will mute rather than fuel greater activism . continued congressional polarization would maintain policy uncertainty , confound debt and deficit negotiations , and impede economic growth . from stymieing medium-term fiscal reforms to delaying needed overhauls from both labour and the housing market , congressional dysfunction would keep us economic performance below its capacity ; likewise , it could eat away at potential output . in other countries , causation will run first , from economics to politics .
paris – the riots that have rampaged across greece may have many causes , but one seldom mentioned is the fracturing of the greek left into georgia papandreou ’s traditional socialist party , pasok , and an increasingly radicalized faction denying all housing with either the european union or modern economics . to varying degrees , this divide is paralyzing socialist parties across europe . that the traditional left is so inert within the middle of today ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic crisis is more than strange . in countries that hold power , like spain , nowadays they are deeply unpopular . where they are in opposition , as in france and italy , they are in disarray – as are germany ’s social democrats , despite being part of the ruling grand coalition .
responses to 9/11 and dominique strauss-kahn ’s recent encounters with an african chambermaid at the new york hotel have very little in common , save for one thing : once again , the cultural conflict has been invoked in misleading ways . whatever happened between the international monetary fund ’s former managing director and his accusers , the fact is that he was arrested and paraded ahead of the press as criminal suspects have been much criticized in france . one allegation , made most recently by a well-known french publicist , is that the arrests have been characteristic of american puritan . the french , he reportedly from a latin culture , has a more liberal understanding of sexual behavior . they are more tolerant of human frailties and have more refined appreciation of the art of seduction .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
they have good reason for taking pride in history . self-confidence among the governed and prudence among rulers : these are the psychological springs of democracy and true liberty , and may never be diverted again in our homeland . nobody has ever doubted that ukraine has changed vastly in its twelve years of independence . yet , caught in the barrel of a gun ’s sights , no – no – men and women who camped in their hundreds of thousands in snow before ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s parliament – know with certainty whether those changes wrenched ukrainians from the grip of fear and apathy . the success of their defiance demonstrates the strength of the idea that jean wilders outgoing president leonid kuchma and his acolytes : that democracy means taking responsibility for one ’s fate into one ’s own hands .
israeli prime ministers are meant to come in two varieties : heavily accented east europeans and grizzled military officers who talk fine terms before acquiescing to the latest american or international demands for concessions , talks , and aid . while previous prime ministers , such as menachem begin and yitzhak shamir , were not averse to lecturing , they lacked strategic shrewd . netanyahu ’s ’s unwillingness to compromise disconcerts , confuses , and often enrages america . his relentless disquisitions on israel ’s all-important strategic landscape , its security demands , its red lines , and jewish history offset only a conciliatory conversation about reopening negotiations that are instantly rejected by palestinians who , like him , fear showing weaknesses . moreover , netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s unsentimental appraisal of the middle east does not line with that of the obama administration – in thrall to its collapsing romania with moderate islamists – and his devoted followers among jewish-american americans .
followers are more likely to attribute charisma to leaders when they feel a powerful need for change , often against a background of personal , organizational , or social crises . the british public , for example , did not regard winston churchill as a charismatic leader in 1939 ; a year later , his vision , confidence , and communication skills gave him charisma , given britons ’ anxieties after the fall of france and dunkirk evacuation . and then , in 1945 , after the public ’s focus turned out to win the war in order to constructing the welfare state , churchill voted from office . his charisma did not foresee defeat ; changing followers need . in practice , charisma is a vague synonym for how to “ personal magnetism . ”
at the same time , the government has secured the eu-wide agreement , which , rather than reducing the size of the european commission , will allow ireland to retain a permanent seat on the commission table . this negotiating success has given the government substantial breathing space to conduct a more effective referendum campaign . this combination of legal guarantees and altered economic circumstances helps to mobilize a majority in favor of the treaty . opinion polls conducted in recent weeks indicate that the yes party commands a strong popular majority , from 62 % to 23 % , with 15 % of voters turn out . but the picture is far from clear-cut .
a decision to reject mergers or to authorize investments that benefits a politically motivated foreign competitor might make economic sense , while raising eyebrows in foreign-policy circles . the solution is not to meddle in competition regulations , but rather to give those where some say in decision-making process . to this end , in a forthcoming paper that i co-authored with foreign-policy experts and other economists , we propose that the eu high representative for foreign affairs and security give the right to object to security grounds by the european commission ’s proposed mergers or investment decisions . eu member states already have such practices , and so should the eu . finally , the eu needs to do more to develop its fiscal toolkit and encourage international exploitation .
a newly gone bill obviously directed against israeli arabs in the knesset ( in parliament ) – would allow mks to be dismissed out of hand for disloyalty to the state . ngos focused on human rights and peacemaking are scrutinized as foreign agents . for israel , its democracy was always a strategic asset , for a democratic israel was a natural fit in western alliances . whereas the west lost no time in imposing sanctions on president vladimir putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s russia following its annexation of crimea , it punished israel ’s occupation of palestinian lands . the more israel embraces putin-inspired practices , yet the weaker becomes its link to its strategic rearguard in the west .
in kosovo , restricting airstrikes to air bombardment made that strategy an overall success : nato forces suffered not as a single act of combat , but around the 300 kosovar , 209 serb , and 3 of all chinese civilians killed . this attitude to the responsibilities of a national leader , stated bluntly and frank , forces that the us should consider a fundamental ethical issue . to what extent should political leaders see their role narrowly , regarding how to advance their citizens ’ interests , and , to what extent , should they be concerned about the well-being of people everywhere ? mr. romano prodi , the president of the eu commission , and italy ’s former prime minister , have reacted to president bush ’s most recent statements by saying that “ if one wants a world leader , one must know how to look after the entire earth , and not only american industry . ” but the question is not just one for aspiring world leaders .
on both of these fronts , the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that europe is repeatedly outmaneuvered by russian president vladimir putin . it increasingly seems that ukraine has become locked in a “ frozen conflict ” – indeed , russia ’s own foreign-policy message . indeed , the situation in ukraine represents a tactical victory for russia , with a fragile but enduring ceasefire – and accompanying legislation that grants donetsk and luhansk considerable political autonomy – – enabling russia to entrench the conflict near the eu ’s borders . moreover , the delayed implementation of key elements of the eu ’s association agreement with ukraine makes clear evidence that at present , russia is demanding eu-ukrainian engagement terms . in europe , the kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy , particularly given hungary ’s decision to suspend gas flows to ukraine .
with a weaker dollar hanging like the sword of damocles over the global economy , almost everybody laments america 's spendthrift habits . but has it ever occurred to anybody how hard americans must work to make everyone else look good ? because of america 's ’s gaping trade deficits , the biggest headache of any developing country 's finance minister nowadays tries to keep his or her country running currency too fast against the us dollar . when was the last time that happened ? chronic debt-crisis countries , from mexico to russia to south korea , are all battling with capital inflows from investors seeking an exit as the dollar collapses .
new york – hurricane harvey has left in his wake upended lives and immense wealth damage , estimated at around $ 150-180 billion . but the rains that inundated texas coast for the better part of one week and a hurricane on the verge of hit south florida also raise deep-seated questions about the united states ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ economic system and policies . it is ironic , of course , that the case for addressing climate change would take place in a state that is home to so many climate-change deniers – and where the us economy depends so heavily on the fossil-fuel industry driving global warming . to be sure , no particular climate event can directly address rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . but researchers have long predicted that such increases would boost not just average temperatures , but also weather variability – and , in particular , a occurrence of extreme events like hurricane harvey .
rather than banding together , each new challenge imparted the eu into ever-smaller groups . europe divided northern and southwestern ; ukraine and the refugee crisis split east and the west . pro-europeans need to engage with the source of discontent and rethink forms used to convey the european ideal . the eu has been founded on a mechanical notion that interdependency reduces conflict . by tying europe ’s resources together – first through the european coal and steel community – and later through the common market and europe , the eu has hoped to bind europe ’s ’s ’s ’s states together so tightly , that war between them would no longer be an option .
in nigeria today , the key question nowadays is not whether presidential obasanjo will quit after his second ( and final ) term term expires next year , but who will succeed him . given nigeria ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s history of sit-tight military dictatorships , that is genuine progress . unfortunately , this is not necessarily the president ’s undoing . attempts by obasanjo ’s supporters to persuade the national assembly to amend the constitution to allow obasanjo to continue in office beyond two terms met a firm wall of opposition . government and business activity practically ground to a halt this spring , as democracy activists in alliances with politicians and legislators opposed to a third term , battled obasanjo ’s ally to thwart the proposed bill .
parfit ’s reaction to this line of argument guides him to make an argument that is perhaps bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics . he regards three guiding theories concerning what we should do – one deriving from kant , one from a social-contract tradition of hobbesian , locke , locke , rousseau , and t.m. scanlon , as well as one from bentham ’s utilitarianism , and argues that kantian and society-treaty theories must be revised in order to be defensible . he then argues that these revised theories coincide with a specific form of consequentialism that is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism . if parfit is right , there is a much less mismatch between apparently conflicting moral theory than we all assumed . defenders of each of these theories , in parfit ’s vivid phrase , “ climbing the same mountain on different sides .
with the rise of the commercial businesses , big family firms have generally disappeared . but this does not mean that a company is the right entity to engage in a altruism – although its various stakeholders obviously can spend whatever part of the income they earn from the company and other sources in altruistic fashion . instead of csr , we should have the psr ( personal social responsibility ) . one can also argue for the psr on the ground that asking csr becomes a way of “ passing the buck ” – evading personal responsibility for doing good . this is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both object of lawsuits in recent years .
tokyo – hillary clinton ’s recent trip to asia may one day be seen as her most momentous visit to the region by the united states diplomat since henry kissinger ’s secret mission to beijing in july 1971 . kissinger ’s mission was triggered by the diplomacy of the soviet union . the renewal of us-chinese relations shifted the global balance of power in the cold war ’s height , preparing the way for china to open its economy , a decision that , more than any other , had defined today ’s world . what clinton did and said during her asian tour marks either the end of an era that kissinger had initiated four decades ago , or the beginning of a distinct new phase into that epoch . clinton ’s tour made the clearest signals yet that america remains reluctant to embrace china ’s shift to regional hegemony .
chinese demand is growing not only , but , as its incomes rise , its composition is shifting toward more sophisticated goods and services . thus , china ’s ’s role is shifting : once the west ’s low-cost supplier is now becoming an important customer for western products . this represents a major opportunity for advanced economies to rebalance their growth and jobs , provided that they are positioned to compete for the relevant components of evolving supply chains . rising chinese incomes also imply structural change for china , as continued growth presupposes a shift in offshore value activity . technology and knowledge will still remain relevant , but china must start generating new technologies in addition to absorbing western tools and capabilities .
historically , french diplomacy excels at grand bargains . but , under merkel , germany avoided such deals , preferring the status quo , or incremental changes , because it typically wound up paying an extra deal . for his part , macron ’s ’s ’s hyper-active diplomacy exposes a beggar-thy-neighbor complex , the symptoms of which – whether brexit or putinism – are hurting european ’s normalization , and hampering the eu ’s ’s ’s mobilization to counterbalance china and the united states . macron ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s rhetoric suggests that it wants to combat these symptoms . but its recent moves seem to be reproducing them .
dublin – europe ’s ’s ’s needs , and europeans , at odds , are worthy . at a time when a strong , coordinated action is needed to stave off a financial meltdown in the european union , the popular backing that drove european integration during the past six decades is waning . after nearly 70 years of tranquility , europeans seem to have forgotten why unity was so vital , indulging nationalist sentiment , without regard for its potential consequences . at the same time , they fail to grasp that their economies are too closely intertwined to an independent economic policy to work . this failure is rooted in electoral politics ’ ’ confinement to individual countries , which forces policymakers to pretend that they can address economic concerns with domestic policies on their own .
the skeptics have a point , but go too far . for one thing , it is still too soon to judge the merits of the argument . a complete assessment of the war in iraq and its implications for the middle east will take a decade or more . clearly , the january 2005 elections marked a positive step for the region . national elections in lebanon and local elections in saudi arabia have followed .
in 1989 , the region ’s ’s ’s peoples brought with them in their “ return to europe ” of their diversity and richness ; their adoration , mysteries , mysteries , and memory ; and their old and new aspirations . and they brought the lesson that shifting from a closed society to an open one is both feasible and extremely difficult . as thomas mann once wrote : “ liberty is more complicated than power . liberty changes the frame and the substance of choice , as well as of individual and collective responsibility . it highlights the contrast between initiative and apathy , enterprise and obedience ; competition , and overall dependence on a state that embodies a sort of unshakable destiny .
cambridge – big tax reform is high on the agenda for the united states in 2017 . the republican-controlled house of representatives has been preparing for this for years , creating detailed plans to overhauling how corporate and personal incomes are taxed . now , with an overwhelming republican majority in the senate and a republican presidency in the white house , these plans can lay the groundwork for legislative action . in particular , proposed corporate-tax reform is substantial . i believe that it will have a very favorable effect on business investment , boosting productivity , and overall economic growth .
this alliance between the two parties led to severe distortions in fundamental western values . palme and oskar lafontaine , then one of opposition leaders in germany , saw no cold war only as part of a conflict between liberty and tyranny . when palme visited east germany in 1984 , he never criticized repression there or the berlin wall . instead , palme praised east germany ’s de facto leader , erich honecker , underscoring shared goals , and a mutually struggle for peace and development . palme ’s main speech mentioned “ détente , ” “ trust , ” and “ friendship , ” but never “ freedom . ”
a different sort of revolution occurred in europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s former colonies in asia , where indigenous peoples had little appetite for being ruled once more by the western powers that had so ignominiously vanquished japan . the vietnamese , indonesians , the burmese , the indians , and malays wanted their freedoms , too . these aspirations were frequently voiced in the un , founded in 1945 . the un , like the dream of european unity , was also part of the 1945 consensus . for a short time , many prominent people – albert einstein , for one – believed that only a global government would ensure global peace .
guided by one of the problem ’s architects , hank paulson , who advocated for deregulation and allow banks to take on even more leveraging , was not surprising that the administration veered from one policy to another – every strategy backed up by absolute conviction until minutes before they were abandoned . even if confidence really was all that mattered , the economy slumps . moreover , what little action was undertaken was intended to refire the financial system . but the financial crisis is just one of a few crises facing the country : the underlying macroeconomic problem was made worse by the sinking fortunes of the bottom half of the population . those who would spend no money and those with money do not spend .
amid the foreign-capital bonanza , stagnant levels of private-sector investment in tradable goods pose an especially potent danger signal that no amount of government-mythmaking should be allowed to override . officials face a straightforward choice : maintain strong prudential controls , or are ready to invest a huge portion of the resources involved in self-insurance by hoarding massive foreign reserves . the deeper problem lies with over-financialization of the global economy that has emerged in the 1990s . the policy dilemmas implied by rising inequality , greater volatility , reduced room for managing the real economy will continue to preoccupy policymakers for decades to come . this is true but unhelpful to say that governments have merely to blame for having recklessly rushed into this savage ride .
even a relatively small amount of material like the cobalt-60 – used in radiotherapy – could do serious harm if combined with conventional explosives in a so-called “ dirty bomb ” ( or otherwise intentionally used to expose the public to dangerous radiation ) . foreign and energy ministers will have an opportunity to strengthen the global nuclear-security framework when they gather at the international atomic energy conference : to foster worldwide efforts in vienna on july 1-5 . this will be the first such event , one that is open to all countries . at the top of the agenda should be ratifying improvements to a crucial nuclear safety instrument – another way to circumvent the physical protection of nuclear material . a proposed amendment would oblige countries to protect their nuclear material when it is used or stockpiled , rather than just when it is transported internationally , as it is now .
this time around , the initiative originated in singh , who had invited his pakistani counterpart yousuf raza gilani to visit mohali , near new delhi to watch the two countries play the seminal final in the cricket world cup . the match played out in march 30 , with pakistan losing narrowly . on the political side , however , the two countries were not evenly aligned . of the troika that currently governs pakistan – a president , a prime minister , and a chief of staff – it is a prime minister who carries the least amount of authority . it was gilani who sat next to singh to watch the game ; but , ultimately , the process , rather than the protocol , will determine how the bilateral relationship moves forward .
indonesia argues that a nation ’s ’s right to master all the information on locally discovered viruses should be protected through the same mechanisms that the united nations food and agriculture organization uses to guarantee poor countries ’ ownership rights and patents on the seeds of their indigenous plants . under the fao seed accord , a nation can register plants , share its seeds , and derive the profits from the resulting product . this useful policy lowers exploitative practices that sometimes allowed multi-national corporations and wealthy governments to get the outrageous profits from indigenous agriculture . it is dangerous , however , that extending this policy to viruses . if the concept of “ viral sovereignty ” had been applied to hiv 25 years ago , we would not have central repositories of thousands of hiv varieties ; these now enable researchers to test drugs and vaccines against all the very different strains of the virus that cause aids .
the new government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s biggest challenge will be to undertake reforms that enable italy ’s economic performance to catch up to that of its neighbors after years of bad policies and neglect . this demands increased investment in innovation and human capital . from 1992 to 2011 , labor productivity grew at an average annual rate of 0.9 % , the lowest in the oecd . since 2001 , unit labor costs have grown faster than real gdp and employment , undermining the economy ’s competitiveness vis-à-vis developing countries . during the past decade , italy ’s share of global exports fell from 3.9 % to 2.9 % .
but technical prowess is not the only or even the central issue . conflicting motivations are probably an even more important reason why citizens increasingly mistrust experts . there is a good misconception when it works . policy wonks think of themselves as unbiased purveyors of high-quality , evidence-based advice . informed citizens reasonably fear that a wonk in question may lie in thrall to a particular ideology or methodology ; that advice can be politically motivated ; or that consultants tailor their own careers to their own career concerns ( how to get that plum work on wall street after leaving governments ) .
whichever party combination on top -- and helmut kohl 's governing coalition must still be viewed as the narrow favorite -- enjoying a meager majority , depending on any major initiative on unlikely support from its political opponents . germany thus appears destined to remain stuck in the doldrums for some time . the price for inaction is substantial . while exports remain booming , joblessness remains stubbornly high . disillusionment with politics rises and may even lead forth among right-wing populists , whom democratic germany has so far been spared .
europe ’s position as the world ’s largest trading bloc , with almost 40 % of all international business , and the increasing prominence of the euro – a crisis notwithstanding as a reserve currency – implies that the eu , like the american one , can set the agenda for negotiating a new global rulebook . the difference is that america is acting decisively , and the eu does not . of course , europe occupies the moral high ground that america has mostly vacillated , owing to its mis-adventures in iraq and afghanistan . europe ’s leadership on climate change and development aid could , if well handled , form a new moral authority . but there is little sign that governments seize up to this opportunity .
madrid – having secured a fifth term ( and his fourth in a row ) as israel ’s ’s ’s ’s prime minister , binyamin netanyahu is on his way to surpassing david ben-gurion , the state ’s founding father , as his country ’s longest-serving leader . yet netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s future would scarcely be recognizable , who strived to combine the country ’s own jewish character with democracy . as l.p. hartley wrote in the go-between opening : “ “ the past is a foreign country : they do things differently . ” following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
in september 2008 , for example , former polish president andrzej herzog published a polemic entitled to stop the ecj ! he charged luxembourg ’s judges of amassing ever-greater competences at the expense of member states , urging the constitutional court to invalidate a number of controversial ecj rulings . herzog ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s broad-side broad-resonated across europe , where there was considerable disquiet over “ judicial activism ” and what some see as an irreversible trend toward ecj empowerment and other eu institutions . in many member states , the ecj ’s decisions produced a backlash , most notably on the left , with trade unions and social movements targeting the court ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s alleged zeal in siding with entrepreneurial interests over workers . such arguments were deployed successfully during the referenda of the constitutional treaty in france and the netherlands in 2005 , and in ireland during the lisbon treaty ’s referendum .
at the same time , countries need to ease workers ’ capacity for changing jobs through reforms to their labor markets and social safety nets . this means shifting the focus from backward labor-market policies to efforts to protect workers in existing jobs , for future-oriented measures , such as innovative insurance mechanisms , and proactive labor-market policies . moreover , formal long-term employer-employee relationships will have to overhauled , with benefits like retirement and health care having made more portable and tailored for evolving occupational arrangements , including the expanding gig ” economy . here , several suggestions have already gone forward , including a universal basic income ; currently piloted in finland and some sub-national jurisdictions like ontario , canada ; negative income taxes ; and various kinds of portable social safety accounts that pool workers ’ benefits . on both of these fronts , france is setting a positive example .
as j.caslen general robert caslen , the pentagon ’s deputy director for the war on terrorism , put it , “ we are not killing them faster than they are being created . we are also failing in applying soft power . according to caslen , “ “ “ we in the pentagon ” are behind our opponents of using communication – either by recruiting or training . the manner in which us use military force also influences rumsfeld ’s own ratio . during the 9/11 aftermath , there was a good deal of compassion and understanding around the world for america ’s ’s ’s ’s military response against the taliban .
our study concludes that india can experience faster economic and industrial growth , higher rates of energy consumption , and cleaner environments . but this is not at all what has gone so far . air , soil , and water pollution have been on the rise , causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year . the key to a clean-energy future lies in clean technologies , the cost of which has been falling steadily and will continue to do so . sometimes , these technologies are paying for themselves and adopting it .
at the same time , the private sector brings innovations to the classroom . for example , some providers develop teach models in which students can watch teacher-created videos online , so that an precious teacher-student face time may focus on interacting rather than lecturing . likewise , skilled teachers may now deliver interactive e-lessons to many classrooms at once , even as hundreds of miles away . as a result , students in places where schools have yet to be built , or too few qualified teachers are available , can still access learning . after all , a smart-teacher lecture – even when it deploys above the internet – is preferable to confronting an under-trained adult .
the obama administration has already been moving against chinese exports of tires and steel pipes ; but this year ’s ’s ’s confrontation will extend well beyond trade . when the us congress takes up the debate over climate change , for example , and some legislators are calling for a cap-and-trade system to be heard , others will demand knowing why america should accept binding emissions-reduction commitments while denying china . in no mood to play a scapegoat , china ’s leaders will use surging national pride to bolster their position and enhance their hand in negotiations . the chinese government has invested heavily in recent years at state-owned companies and privately-owned “ national ” champions , mostly to ensure that china profits from markets ’ power while leadership controls as much as it can . to help those domestic powerhouses boost their market leverage , the us government often favors them at the expense of foreign competitors .
but , faced with the possibility that today ’s low inflation may cause lasting supply shocks , they are also reluctant to ease more now . so , while central banks are reluctant to cede back to their formal 2 % inflation target , they are willing to prolong the timeline for attaining it , as they have done time and again , effectively conceding that inflation may remain low for longer . alternatively , they would have to sustain for much longer their unconventional monetary policies , including quantitative easing and negative policy rates – an approach that most central banks ( excluding the bank of japan ) are uncomfortable . this central bank ’s patience risks being de-anchoring inflation expectations downward . but continued for much longer with unconventional monetary policies also carries the risk of undesirable asset-price inflation , excessive credit expansion , and asset bubbles .
for an agreement on similar scale and influence , world leaders – particularly in america and china – would need to come under similarly high pressure . a global pact would need to be an urgent necessity , rather than an appealing possibility . what would convince chinese leaders that they must quickly reinforce the open global economy , which has enabled china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s export-led economic rise ? one such catalyst might be a financial crisis emanating from the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s risk-laden shadow-banking system . a contest for global leadership might serve this purpose just as well .
winston churchill ’s famous renunciation of the delaying tactics of the british and french on the eve of world war ii should serve as alarm for french president nicolas sarkozy . in fanning the vicious anti-immigrant passions of short-term political gain , he will have dishonor , for the first time , and then defeat . for , though a french majority today may be inclined to sympathize with sarkozy ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s immigrant-bashing rhetoric , there is no guarantee that he will be re-elected in 2012 . it is not so much sarkozy ’s performance as president that most frenchmen reject ; it is his essence . at a time of rising unemployment , with france dominating fears about the future , the french need a reassuring father or a mother figure , not a jittery and manipulative leaderready to compromise ethics and france ’s proud tradition of granting every citizen the right to equality under the rule of law .
millions of people end up in protracted displacement , spending an estimated 25 years , on average , stuck in limbo , unsure when one might return home . in 2016 , the developed world should agree to accept a combined total approaching one million refugees annually , either through resettlement or through issuance of humanitarian , student , labor , and other visas . with canada alone indicating that it will resettle 50,000 syrian refugees this year this year , it is clear that there is an achievable goal . at the same time , the international community must encourage the integration of refugees in major host countries like turkey , kenya , lebanon , and jordan . as it stands , such countries receive a mere fraction of the $ 3,000-5,000 per refugee required annually to provide adequate housing , food , health-care provision , schooling , and job training during the first few years of displacement .
berkeley – inequality is on the public side almost everywhere nowadays . indeed , in the world ’s two largest democracies , india and the united states , widespread popular movements against rising inequality and elite greed are becoming extremely salient issues in looming national elections . yet , in both countries , some of them social inequalities have been on the downward trend over the past few decades . in india , certain historically disadvantaged groups ( particularly among lower-class men ) are now politically assertive . the most egregious vestiges of caste discrimination are gradually vanishing .
but unemployment remains on the rise in the heavily indebted southern countries , and output continues to lag behind germany and other northern european countries . the main reason for this lag is not simply low demand or large debts . there is a huge gap between unit labor costs – real ( inflation-adjusted ) wages – adjusted for productivity – in germany and the heavily indebted southern countries . when the crisis hit , production costs in greece were about 30 % higher than in germany , meaning that greece exported very little and imported very much . production costs in other heavily indebted countries were 20-25 % higher than in germany .
most importantly , despite being a russian army massing against the us , the us is embarking on an electoral campaign . next month , ukraine ’s ’s citizens will be freely elected a new president – the best rebuke that could be made to russia ’s supposed failure to uphold democracy . and yet , working with ukrainians to rebuild our country after viktor yanukovych ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s predatory rule faces faces confronting a new threat , in the form of a “ peace-offensive ” – that the old staple of soviet-style diplomacy designed to undermine western resolve . indeed , russian president vladimir putin ’s recent phone call to us president barack obama for his search for renewed diplomatic talks , followed by a russian white paper on how to resolve the kremlin ’s making crisis effectively amounts to a peace offensive that is offensive to make peace . putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s 1945 yalta conference in 1945 , where joseph stalin made winston churchill and franklin d. roosevelt ’s complicit in a division of europe that enslaved half of the continent for nearly a half-century .
likewise , in 1973 , dimona ’s defenders downed a wayward libyan civilian airliner headed to the reactor , killing 108 people . but the 1991 persian gulf war upset whatever solace israel could take from the past . iraqi scud missiles bombarded tel aviv and one has come close to breaking dimona . hezbollah ’s bombardment of north israel in 2006 further demonstrated the country ’s ’s vulnerability to a missile attack . and , while israel ’s ’s ’s ’s arrow of ballistic missile defense , now surrounding dimona , may prefer to favor a patriot system that failed in 1991 , syria ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s more advanced scuds and iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s 3 3 rocket present a more capable challenge than saddam ’s ’s ’s ’s projectiles .
moreover , us financial authorities ’ ability to stimulate the economy is being constrained by the rest of the world ’s unwillingness to accumulate additional dollar reserves . until recently , us investors had hoped that the american federal reserve would do whatever it takes to avoid a recession , because it did on earlier occasions . now , they need to recognize that the fed may no longer be on the issue of doing so . with oil , food , and other commodities holding , and the renminbi appreciating somewhat more rapidly , the fed must also worry about inflation . if interest rates were to fall beyond a certain point , the dollar would come under renewed pressures , and long-term bond yields would actually go up in yield .
and , having marry and she has children her own , benefits from two highly educated , employing parents , which means twice as much literate conversation in her home , twice links , and dual encouragement to succeed her . literate , pushy mothers make all the difference . as us secretary of state hillary clinton put it in this problem of newsweek , “ the world needs to think more strategically and creatively about tapping into women ’s growth potential . ” studies show that helping women access trade and grow companies helps create jobs and boost incomes . but on the planet worst , compelling women to stay home is more socially acceptable than confront the fact that this means choosing to drag down incomes for all .
one factors driving the uk ’s sense of uneasiness in its relations with an increasingly bureaucratized europe are the belief that its values and institutions move closer to those of america or , indeed , to other english-speaking former colonies . until the 1990 ’s , british euro-skeptics coined the term “ anglosphere ” to describe a model that was more successful and more expansionary than that of the eu . the us was the “ “ other woman , ” undermining britain ’s ’s ’s allegiance to the eu as an attractive permanent partner . as a result , britain has lost much of its capacity for making an effective contribution to european reform . indeed , the last time britain had a strong european voice more than two decades ago .
but the battle between pro- and anti-europeans obscures what really is at stake – and thus what should be the focus of the electoral debate : how europe can generate sustained economic growth . that question , rather than an interminable defense against euroskepticism , should be a key item on deliberation for parties that push for an improved europe for all . broad-based recovery – in terms of investment , demand , and jobs – is the best arms with which to confront those who would destroy the european project . the upcoming election will render the public ’s judgment about the success or failure of the austerity policies pursued . but it will also determine whether europe will remain the world ’s leading economic powerhouse , maintain its social model , and safeguard its own framework of human rights and liberties in a world that does not wait for europeans to resolve their differences .
then there is the notion of systemic risk that comes not only in the beholder ’s eye but might be impossible to forecast . the mexican crisis of 1994-1995 was perceived as a systemic risk from washington , but not by most european capitals . americans thought that the europeans were parochial ; they thought that the u.s. unreasonably influenced by its 2000 kilometer border with mexico . all agree that ecuador posed no systemic risk ( though this was urgent ! ) , but what about brazil ? and who before july 1998 thought that a russian default would trigger a global financial panic ?
the eurozone ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s southern members must to cut their wage costs to signal back toward claw back the competitiveness that they lost since adopting the common currency . concern over such divergences has also reached a task force headed by european union president herman van rompuy to devise fundamental reforms to intra-eu economic-policy coordination rules . a crucial proposal by the task force ’s ’s first meeting was to develop competitiveness indicators , and then force member countries to adopt “ remedial action ” should the eu find big divergences . but this approach risks leading in the wrong direction . the competitiveness that is typically measured in terms of unit labor costs is a relative concept .
mexico city – during the spanish civil war , thousands of young americans went to spain to join fighting fascism as part of the “ “ abraham lincoln brigade . ” today , as more people wake up to the threat that american president donald trump poses to the rule of law , human rights , and the international order , a new global opposition movement is emerging to defend democracy and basic decency . france could adopt three tactics . simply put , one approach is to wait and hope that trump is veering into a lame duck through damning revelations about his administration . better yet , trump might have been impeached or removed from office after the 25th amendment to the american constitution if enough members of his own administration come to mind at his disposal as part of the presidency .
no single measure would do more to make the world a less dangerous place than to reduce substantially its oil consumption . and no single measure would do more to reduce global oil consumption than a sharp rise in gasoline taxes in a country that consumes more than any other country : america . if americans were to start paying more for gasoline , they would use less of it . none of this would immediately happen . in the short run , americans would need to make modest economic sacrifices in the form of higher fuel prices .
new york – internet firms are supposedly all about cutting edge , but reality and buzz sometimes conflict . consider groupon : its focus is groups ’ power , but its actual business is an old standby direct-mail marketing and coupons . but groupon is spreading that model to a much broader audience – not so much to their users , but instead to merchants that offer coupons . in fact , groupon does for email what other internet companies do for yellow pages or classified advertisements : encourage merchants to use modern technology to reach their customers . clearly , the model makes plenty of customers ’ sense : groupon now has more than 50 million subscribers , and plans for $ 150 million by year-end .
the prevailing view is that the downward trend largely reflects the downward trend in equilibrium or “ “ natural ” interest rates , fueled by shifts in saving and investment fundamentals . in other words , the higher propensity to save in emerging economies , together with investors ’ increased preference for safe assets , has boosted the supply of savings globally , even as weak growth prospects and heightened uncertainty in the advanced economies have depressed investment demand . this perceived slump in “ natural ” interest rates is viewed as a key impediment to economic recovery , because it impedes monetary policy ’s capacity to provide sufficient stimulus by pushing the real rate below its equilibrium level , owing to the zero lower bound on nominal rates . how to stem the downward trend has thus become the subject of the lively debate . conspicuously absent from the discussion , however , is the role of financial factors in explaining the downward trend in real rates .
as enrico moretti of the university of california at berkeley emphasizes in his book the new geography of jobs , the salience of this new divide makes sense : university graduates account for about half of all the total population in america ’s top metropolitan areas , but are four times less many in worse-off areas . economic shocks tend to aggravate this political divide . those who fall out of existence and work in traditional production districts caught in the tumult of globalization are multiple losers : their jobs , their housing wealth , and their children ’s fortunes are all strongly correlated . in fascinating new research , mit ’s david autor and his coauthors studied the political consequences . they find that american districts where the economy was severely hit by chinese exports reacted by substituting moderate representatives with more radical politicians – either from the left or the right .
the un commission of inquiry collected information identifying some of those responsible for the crimes it investigated but did not make it public . the names of those responsible should be made public , either by the commission or by another body created by the un human rights council . those to be name would be reported to announce and given a chance to refute the findings . if they fail to react , or if their reactions are unpersuasively , their names and the crimes attributable to them should be made public . the human rights council could conduct itself .
the scars of colonialism are fresher in france than anywhere else in europe ; the country has europe 's largest muslim minority ; and , with moderates showing particularly weak and divided , an extreme right cresting from opinion polls . these ingredients could constitute a recipe for disaster . already , le pen appears to be reverting to form . “ national unity ” is a pathetic political maneuver , france complained , after having not been invited to the rally the day following the attacks . yet , if proper leaders are at the helm , a january 7 attack might spur a renewed sense of collective purpose and a political revival .
that means increasing capital and human capital intensity across the tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economy . on the tradable side , one should look for structural change and a shift in output toward higher-value-added components . here , innovation , and conditions that support it – including competition and free entry and exit from the market – also play an important role . if policymakers pick a model based on a large , state-dominated sector protected against internal and external competition , then innovation goals are unlikely to be met , adversely affecting future growth . meanwhile , the non-tradable side should grow .
to be sure , elections on their own do not produce democracy , either . consider those cases when elections empower a supermajority ethnic or religious group that then rides roughshod over minorities – an outcome that has been seen all too often in the balkans . then there are the cases when a leader ’s choice is treated as if it somehow legitimizes the ensuing dictatorship . this has been the case in russia since president vladimir putin ’s ’s first electoral victory in 2000 became a potemkin democracy . this year , another election , neither free nor fair , gives putin another term in office .
but iranians are nothing like the nazis , and there is no country as much as the soviet union posing the type of threat that inspired us president richard nixon to head toward beijing in 1972 . equally problematic has been a tendency to match the two sets of negotiations . beyond timing , they have little in common . what they do share is that their “ success ” was driven largely by the sentiment that powerful external threats made the alternative – no deal at all – much worse . in greece ’s case , negotiations were propelled by the specter of embittered greece cozying up to russian president vladimir putin ’s side with its own dangerous revisionist ambitions or acting as a conduit for europe .
what if that benefit comes from the job-enhancing performance of drug use ? for athletes seeking to compete in clean , the threat that they might be self-defeating by a competitor that does not grow faster , stronger , or more devoted but who takes a drug to obtain the edge is profoundly personal . when drugs are forbidden , but some athletes then use them anyway in the playing field in favor of a patient . if we prohibit drugs in the olympic games , we owe it to athletes to discourage , detect , and punish those who cheat . integrity seems an old-fashioned idea , but it is at its heart .
at the same time , external powers compounded the problem . south korea ’s admission to the oecd required its government to dismantle capital controls , exposing the economy to inflows of short-term hot money . more broadly , countries felt pressure from the imf and american treasuries to remove capital-flow constraints , which magnified risks , and made sustaining pegged exchange rates more problematic . this sketch of crisis highlights how much has changed during the ensuing 20 years . for starters , the crisis countries ratcheted up their investment rates and growth expectations toward sustainable levels .
beyond this , the dollar is going almost anywhere . it is not to replace the euro or the yen , given that both europe and japan have serious economic problems on their own . the renminbi is approaching , but not before 2020 , by which time shanghai will have become a world-class international financial center . and , even then , the renminbi probably will share the international stage with the dollar , rather than being replaced . one thing that could precipitate the us dollar ’s demise would be reckless economic mismanagement in america .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
i and several other affluent americans contribute millions of dollars to pastuffs engaged in the 2004 presidential election . the us is deeply disturbed by the direction in which the bush administration takes both the united states and the world . if americans reject us president donald trump ’s policies at the polls , america can write off the bush doctrine as a temporary aberration and resume its rightful place around the world . if american voters endorse those policies , the american people will need to live with the world ’s hostility and endure a vicious cycle of escalating violence . in this effort , i committed $ 10 million to “ america come together ” ( act ) “ a paypal get-out-the-vote operation , and $ 2.5 million to the #moveon.org fund , ” the popular publicly advocacy group , which washes advertisements to highlight administration misdeeds .
at the same time , russia has not overplayed america , with 20 % of respondents cited the country as their “ “ best friend ” outside the middle east and north africa . but russia is also likely to disappoint its supporters in the middle east , not least as a regional peace broker . following america ’s successful peace deal with the afghan taliban , and almost 30 years after the country ’s decade-long soviet occupation – the kremlin has stepped in to mediate debate among the taliban and the representatives of other afghan groups . still , the middle east – a manifold conflict stemming from religious , ethnic , political , historic , and strategic factors – has time and again exhausted foreign actors ’ commitment . there is little reason to think that russia , which has never been particularly inclined toward long-term peace-building , will mediate , let alone underwrite , a durable peace agreement .
but the experience shows that options for retirement decisions or for hiring fewer hours are influenced by the compensation members of this group receive . and this amount partly reflects the fact that employed people who collect social security and medicare are subject to the payroll taxes that finance them . the payroll tax paid by employees stands at 6.65 % ( employers are paying the same rate ) and goes beyond the personal-income tax . moreover , because of the complicated rules that govern the degree of welfare benefits , an older worker who pays this payroll tax is likely to receive no additional benefit . for many older workers , the choice is not whether to work .
the eu ’s enlargement will provide immense impetus for europe as a whole , particularly the baltic region , from which so many new eu members would come to pass . up to now , the eu has interest in kaliningrad centered on how to restrict the visa rights that the oblast ’s citizens now use to traverse poland and the baltic states so as to revisit the rest of russia . on the other hand , the eu will boost trade and economic growth , and these might provide genuine incentives to turn kaliningrad into an ever more attractive neighbor and trade partner , rather than merely an feared source of illegal russian immigrants to the eu through a supposedly lax visa regime . if this fails , however , the contrasts between kaliningrad and the rest of the region will be shamefully striking . the eu must forge close cooperation with russian leaders and kaliningrad oblast in designing a viable future for the enclave .
without nuclear fusion , future generations ’ ’ energy options will be severely constrained – – – – to create a serious problem for the developed and developing world alike . lev artsimovich , tokamak ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s inventor , has said that “ fusion will be ready when society needs it . ” one hopes that it is right . but , rather than depending on fusion researchers to defy the odds , the world should foot investment in technology . our future may depend on this .
would the imf not insisted on an even tougher program , with less funding for any eu country outside the euro area ? the obvious explanation for the imf ’s extraordinary gamble is that the managing director who made the decision to back greece so heavily hailed from the eurozone , and barely disguising his ambitions to run for the french presidency – that is , well before his arrest in new york on charges of rape . moreover , europeans dominate the fund ’s management . it is a disreassuring conflict of interest that debtors dominate an international institution that lends them vast sums to money . that mismanagement should disqualify any eurozone policymaker from the imf ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s management chief managing director , and yet , christine lagarde , a french finance minister , was named to succeed her compatriot dominique strauss-kahn after his resignation .
thus , the three problems facing europe in the second half of this year are closely intertwined . the eu will need the strongest leadership team that it can find to steer through treacherous waters and implement crucial financial reforms . just now , the signs are far from being a promise to do so . there are few new faces , or even ideas on the horizon , at least for now . one must hope that one should be surprised .
a more nuanced approach would focus on eliminating the underlying , interrelated barriers faced by women in getting nominated office and running successful campaigns . such hurdles include the electoral system itself ( women fare better under proportional representation than they do in first-past-the-post systems based on single-member districts ) ; lack of funding access ; weaker professional networks ; and outside responsibilities that make it harder to engage in punishing , unpredictable work environments . overcoming such structural barriers requires a comprehensive strategy to support women candidates . one of the most powerful tools is money ; it is a good deal . in many countries , campaigning costs are becoming prohibitively high for the majority of aspirants , regardless of gender .
this reflects both a public-investment deficiency and an information-training gap : investing in job-training in a rapidly developing industrial architecture is like shooting at a moving destination . given imperfect information about the future needs , labor markets are out of equilibrium . powerful technological and global market forces are not confined to any single country . the same issues arise everywhere , with disparities in outcomes reflecting variability in market flexibility and socio-political choices . these adverse trends dates back to around 1980 .
wikipedia its boosters trumpet it as heralding the advent of “ web 2.0 . ” whereas “ web 1.0 ” facilitated the storage and transmission of vast amounts of different types of information in cyberspace , “ web 2.0 ” supposedly renders an entire process interactive , eliminating the last frontier separating the transmitter and sharing of information . yet we were here before – indeed , for most human history – to most of human history . the sharp divide between producers and knowledge consumers began only around 300 years ago , when book printers secure royalty to their trade in the face of piracy in a rapidly expanding literary market . a legacy of their success , copyright laws , continues to block attempts to render cyberspace a free marketplace of thought .
that is somewhat ironic : the removal from the uk from the ecj ’s jurisdiction now amounts to one of potentially principal intent . thus , delegation after delegation to ministers , mayors , and assorted financial-sector lobbyists were filling london ’s best hotels and providing a welcome boost to high-end restaurant trading . luxembourg , frankfurt , dublin , and elsewhere have produced glossy presentations about their towns ’ competitive perks over london : lower-estate costs , lower corporate tax rates ( which sounds implausible when argued with the irish accent ) , michelin-starbucks , and portuguese dealerships , all essential services rendered by a vibrant financial center . some of these presentations raised whry or two . french president françois hollande was elected on behalf of the world of high finance .
that line of reasoning has guided iran ’s ’s ’s leaders to categorize its disruptive activities in theaters , not least by seizing the british tanker in the strait of hormuz last month ( too , noting that the uk is europe ’s weak links ) . iran ’s mounting aggressiveness has already raised hackles in israel , reportedly targeting iranian assets in iraq ( having already sparked strikes against iranian forces in syria ) . the danger now is that iran or its proxies in the middle east will misread the situation and cross a red line . iran was understandably frustrated by europe ’s slowing progress toward launching instex , a bartering mechanism designed to authorize some trade between europe and iran , despite american sanctions . but those in iran who argue that they have gotten nothing from europe are simply wrong .
so executives are quick to embrace “ aggressive ” or “ creative ” accounting methods that flatters earnings projections , conceals risks , and portrays a smooth track record on earnings growth . finally , managers , rather than distant shareholders , control access to well-paying appointments and lucrative consulting jobs . thus , both inside and outside auditors are often co-opted . to be sure , american corporate and securities scandals have exposed regulatory gaps-inadequate enforcement of disclosure requirements , for instance , or over-dependence on the auditors ’s auditors and on so-called “ chinese wall ” to hold the brokerage and investment-banking activities separate . moreover , america ’s accounting standards have been unable to cope with bookkeeping frontiers off-balance sheet transactions , structured financing methods , and byzantine contract valuations .
countries in asia – indeed , throughout the developing world – are simply not exporting their plentiful and economically vital genetic resources . the convention against biological diversity ( cbd ) , signed in 1992 , promised an international regime on access and benefits ( arabs ) of genetic resources . this would give researchers and companies access to the developing world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s genetic treasure trove in return for the combined profits of the pre-development goods sectors . but brokering the arabs regime has proved elusive , and , in keeping with an international agreement , diminishing access and thus falling benefit-sharing over the last five or so years . this implies potentially massive economic , ecological , and social casualties to both the developed and the developing world .
at the same time , the benefits of economic growth will become less unequally distributed than they have been in the last couple of years , even as they continue to accrue disproportionately to those who are already better off . a second group , led by china , will stabilize at a lower growth rate than recent historical averages , while continuing to mature structurally . they will progressively reorient their growth models to make them more sustainable – an effort that occasional bouts of global financial-market instability will shake but not derail . and they will work to deepen their domestic markets , improve regulatory frameworks , empower the private sector , and enlarge the scope for market-based economic management . a third group , led by europe , will struggle , because continued social stagnation and political disenchantment with social and political disenchantment in some countries , complicating regional policy choices .
once again , european companies have come to bear the costs of such measures . and , because european firms are so heavily integrated with america ’s economy , europe has struggled to maintain an autonomous foreign policy toward iran . unless europe can become an international currency to rival the us dollar , europe ’s economy will remain highly vulnerable to american extraterritoriality . a third area of soft-power weaponization has been technology , particularly with respect to 5g . unlike 3g and 4g broadband systems , 5g deployment has far-reaching security and geopolitical implications , for it promises not only to improve a mobile telephony , but also to accelerate the growth of the internet of things and digitalization of entire economies .
so , what accounts for the partisan performance gap ? blinder and watson seem to suggest that five factors – including oil shocks , productivity growth , defense spending , foreign economic growth , and consumer confidence – may together explain 56 % of the growth gap . but it is impossible to know the extent to which these factors were influenced by america ’s president bush ’s policies . we know even less about the factors responsible for the other 44 % of the performance gap . in assessing clinton ’s statements on the topic , fact-checkers make much of the found by blinder and watson show that , contrary to widespread assumptions , fiscal and monetary policies are no more “ pro-growth ” or expansionary under democrats than under republican presidents , and therefore can not explain the performance differential .
but , with myanmar included , this may prove far too difficult politically , and an asean sub-grouping can become more realistic . another option is for the us to press for the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) . this was proposed in the bush administration to forge ties with some asean members – singapore , vietnam , and brunei – as well as others across the pacific . this could be built to include other open southeast asian economies – – – – – malaysia and thailand , with an eventual target being an apec-wide agreement , an impressive achievement if realized by late 2011 , when it will obama ’s turn to play host all of the leadership leaders . in this era of crisis and unemployment , the american public can question freer trade .
the trouble is that few outsiders seem to be listening , much less preparing to confront the eventual limits of central-bank effectiveness . as a result , they are risking aggravating the potential challenges . this is particularly true of those policymaking entities , which possess far better instruments for tackling the advanced economies ’ underlying growth and employment challenges . rather than taking advantage of the opportunities provided by central banks ’ ’ ’ ’ unconventional monetary policies to respond effectively , too many have slipped into an essentially dormant mode of inaction and denial . in the united states , for a full fifth year in davos , congress went on a full-fledged budget , let alone address the economy ’s underlying growth and employment headwinds .
meanwhile , only about 15 % of private-sector employees – people who presumably rely on government-funded education and infrastructure – get the sort of fixed-benefit retirement plan to cushion ryan ’s retirement , according to the consumer pension center . in order to restore fairness , the government should follow the private sector ’s lead and links policymakers ’ pensions to their own performance . like high-level managers at publicly traded private companies , policymakers who make the wrong choices should confront clawbacks on the basis of reduced pensions . a retirement is a long-term commitment from a state – and , ultimately , a german taxpayer – to an individual politician . if policymakers receive their pensions starting at age 50 , as ryan will , the retirement benefit could realistically be paid out for the 40-plus year .
abbas ’s ’ ’ presidential term has expired , and elections are under constant delays . pa prime minister salam fayyad , like his hamas counterparts in gaza , rules by decree , keeps parliament inactive , and silences the opposition . with no institutionalized democratic legitimacy , the pa is bound to rely on its security forces and occupier , israel , to enforce its will . of course , throughout history , national liberation movements were forced to marginalize radicals and fanatics in order to reach out to the promised land . this was true of zionism , italy ’s italian risorgimento , and , most recently , catholics in northern ireland .
the head of the guantánamo task force , the hindu admiral harry b. harris , jr. recently defended harsh treatments for his fellow inmates who claim , “ “ ’re all terror combatants ; are all hostile combatants . ” but the cia made errors before . murat kurnaz , for example , a german-born turkish man , was kept at guantánamo for four years before being released last august . the case of khaled el-masri , a german citizen of lebanese descent , appears to be another of those errors . confiscated by the cia in macedonia , it went to afghanistan and interrogated for five months , before being released without charges .
the treaty calls for a new eu foreign minister , despite being formally denied that title , this is what everyone calls him – with the strong administrative infrastructure of the european commission and the council . a rotating presidency would replace an elected council president . a new balance would be struck between the eu and its member states , with a stronger role given to europe ’s parliament and national parliaments . eu citizens would be enendowed with legally binding rights , and majority decision-making would become the general norm . a high price had to pay for this deal .
we must hope that the government can answer this question . perhaps the most intriguing parts of “ “ future ” finance ” concern how to payment them are shifting . cash is in decline in many countries , even though rates are markedly different from the eu . cash usage has dropped more than 80 % in sweden over the past decade , and is now plummeting by 10 % per year in the united kingdom , while barely changing in germany . van steenis warns that the “ swedish experience ” shows that without a coordinated plan , the pace of change risks excluding some groups in society .
a second reason for avoiding imf intervention in europe is that lending to a potentially insolvent country has serious implications for the fund . for starters , take the imf ’s preferred-creditor position at face value , an imf loan would entail substituting its “ willful defaultable ” debt for “ willful defaultable ” debt with private bondholders because the fund ’s money is used mainly to service outstanding bonds . as a result , a pool of lucky bondholders would be pulled up at the expense of those who have become junior to imf debt and remain highly exposed to any likely restructuring . because a “ “ haircut ” can only be imposed on whatever is left out of willful private-sector debt , the greater the imf ’s share , the deeper the haircut needed to restore sustainability . for the same reasons , imf loans can be a burdensome legacy .
beijing – consider this : despite china ’s swelling foreign-exchange reserves – the result of persistent current-account surpluses – the market and inter-bank short-term interest rates are soaring . how did this happen , and what should policymakers do about it ? indeed , the issue , at root , is structural . after all , china ’s ’s ’s ’s monetary stock is relatively plentiful . as the world ’s largest currency issuer , china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s broad money supply ( m2 ) is 1.5 times that of the united states , with a 12/gdp ratio of roughly 200 % , compared to roughly 80 % in the us .
while institutions like weill cornell in qatar and the gulf university of science and technology in kuwait have launched innovative research and training programs that focus on these types of health challenges , much more needs to be done . another problem is that the region ’s educational and skills-training programs do not stimulate sufficient systemic thinking . globally , public-health policies move toward more multidisciplinary integration of engineering , medicine , social , and managerial sciences , as well as the humanities . by not upholding an integrated approach , gcc institutions risk falling behind the global norm . technologies and new approaches to public health are important ; but they will be inefficient unless they are tailored to meeting local people ’s true needs .
more telling , of course , will be the party primaries in november . given hollande ’s rock-bottom approval ratings , it is widely believed that france ’s victorious republican will be france ’s next president . and , while juppé remains far ahead in opinion polls so far , the french could reject his happy version of french identity in favor of sarkozy ’s ’s much darker one . i remain convinced that juppé is most likely to emerge as france ’s next president . in terms of age and profile , he resembles the french version of hillary clinton , more practiced in the exercise than his conquest of power .
under the banner of “ “ simplifying , ” ” ” ” ” ” a “ “ how ” ” gravitates toward the outsourcing of most of the execution by agencies to enendowed agencies , one hopes , with more flexibility in order to fulfill their particular missions . this demands a smoothly working , and a much more efficient interlinkages between agencies and the european commission that retain overall control over them , as well as a careful revision of eu-wide financial regulation and its oft-criticized bureaucratic red tape . some hardball political choices lie ahead : which components of a framework program become advanced and which ends ? how can an innovation that is never just technological but social as well , both achievable and fully employed ? and , perhaps most importantly , what are the optimal trade-offs to get eu member states and european institutions to cooperate more effectively for a shared european future ?
despair and alienation have taken hold of the younger generation of arabs representing more than 50 % of the region ’s population . political repression and arab public opinion ’s silence should concern america and its arab allies , not reassuring them , for it implies that there is no way for the public to channel its interests , demands , and frustrations peacefully . an american invasion of iraq , with its large number of civilian casualties , would deepen a sense of victimization and defeat feeling among arab youths , and make them amenable to an al qaeda-style holy war cells . far from undermining militancy and combatting terror , war is likely to play into al qaeda ’s hands , giving it a new lease on life . indeed , militant islamists , hoping to recover from the crushing blows they have absorbed since the war on terror began , are already positioning themselves to capitalize on the coming war with iraq .
but nord stream 2 would make those woes unavoidable . a poorer ukraine would be an even easier victim to russian aggression than it is today . and the kremlin parts of belarus would be even tighter should yamal close . moreover , germans and other europeans would not be spared the consequences . by committing to buy more russian gas than necessary , the eu would help finance russia ’s military build-up , which represents a direct threat to european peace .
san francisco – it seems puzzling at first : prescription drug prices in the united states continues to skyrocket at an alarming rate , despite the threat ( or promise ) of competition from cheaper generic substitutes . but , in fact , there is no mystery . indeed , pharmaceutical companies are paying players throughout the entire healthcare system in order to favor their more expensive drugs over lower-priced alternatives . and those who should act as watchdogs for patients happily go along . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
but while there are many reasons for blaming foreign powers on the region ’s parlous state of affairs , blaming others – or even one another – will resolve nothing . after all , the arab world has many homegrown problems too , including inefficient and ineffective governance , unholy alliances , and undeveloped national capacities . catastrophe awaits any region that is powerless to shape its own futures , in which an overwhelming majority of citizens feel disenfranchised . though the arab world has traditionally been conservative , at nearly 70 % of its citizens below the age of 35 , and among those who suffer the highest rates of unemployment in most countries . that constitutes not only a tremendous waste of resources , but also a serious long-term sociopolitical problem .
in order to ensure that female vaccinators remain engaged in this fight , addressing barriers – whether in terms of physical safety , social constraints , or low pay – is essential to addressing the obstacles they confront . let us remember , therefore , that risks these women take to protect all of them from a disease that has taken an enormous toll on global health . as polio survivor , i simply can not fathom the possibility that , with complete eradication in our sights , we may enable polio to return . since unicef began emphasizing women ’s hiring for its polio program in 2014 , the rate of female vaccinators has increased dramatically . nearly 62 % of vaccinators in nigeria are female , compared to just 11 % for vaccinators .
a large minority of citizens in the developed world filtering bubbles created by such platforms – the digital false realities in which existing beliefs have become more rigid and extreme . in america , roughly one-third of the adult population has become impervious to new ideas , including demonstrable facts . such people are easy to manipulate , a concept that former google design ethicist tristan harris calls for “ brain hacking . ” western democracies , for their part , are ill-prepared to deal with this threat . the american side has no effective regulatory framework for internet platforms , and lacks the political will to create one .
when american soldiers were captured in iraq , president bush said that he expects them to be treated humanely . “ if not , ” the president warned , “ the people who mistreat prisoners will be treated as war criminals . ” president bush ’s remarks drove home the importance of rigorous adherence to the geneva conventions , and questions about how war crimes trials could be convened in post-war iraq and who conduct them . america ’s plan for war crimes cover violations committed before the current conflict began . american officials recently released a list of iraqis facing trial for past crimes .
second , today , ’s algorithms are becoming extremely fine at pattern recognition when they are provided with big data sets – to find objects in youtube videos or detecting a credit card fraud – but they are far less efficient with unusual circumstances that suit them neither the usual pattern nor simply when the data are scarce nor noisy . to manage such cases , you need a skillful individual , with her or her experience , intuition , and social consciousness . third , most recent systems can not explain what they have done , or why they recommend a meaningful course of action . in these “ black box ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” you can not simply read a code to analyze what happens or check when a hidden bias occurs . when interpretability matters prominently – for example , in many medical applications – you need trained human in the decision-making loop .
at the same time , the country has advanced along the road of fiscal federalism : channeling all value-added tax on the federal budget ; and revenue taxes to the regions ; make for a sensible budget distributing system between authority tiers . a second important area of progress has been reform of the russian federation : the establishment of federal districts and the reform of the governing council . these changes are controversial , but a federation whose laws go unnoticed by some of its constituent members can not function normally ; a federation in which the observance of laws depends on a whim of local administrators simply can not exist . president putin ’s ’s moves to strengthen an integrated system of power thus sound and right . as a result , russia today is a realistic , even if imperfectly , federation .
for israel , this applies more than a set of related reasons . some of netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s top cabinet ministers , including avigdor liberman , a hawkish defense minister , and yuval steinitz steinitz , a member of the us security cabinet , have quickly expressed concern about an arms deal . within israel ’s own right-wing flank , many worry that trump is merely attempting to appease israel with his campaign rhetoric , and views saudi arabia as the mainstay of us interests in the region . it is possible that trump hopes that saudi arabia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s support can help to drive forward negotiations between israelis and palestinians . but , given trump ’s failure to take a genuine stand on any core area of disagreements – including frontiers , refugees , and jerusalem ’s status – the notion that he plays some well-thought-out long game on the israel-palestine conflict seems farfetched .
and vulnerabilities in the london housing market do not seem to have spread elsewhere . indeed , in the northwest world , residential real-estate prices show signs of accelerating upward . should this trend bear far-reaching implications for the uk economy . strengthening northern housing markets could do wonders to turn back the unsettling regional inequalities that have emerged over the last few decades . one thing that we can be absolutely certain is that the government should pursue policies to engage with a north powerhouse and , perhaps with the engine of midlands , too .
new delhi – for some time now , multinational corporations ( mncs ) have been gaming the global economy ’s rules in order to minimize their tax liability – or even eliminate it completely . and , for some time now , an independent commission to reform international corporate taxation ( the icrict ) has argued for us mncs ’ unitary taxation . fortunately , there have been some encouraging recent signs that the image of a singapore-tax is gaining traction . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
this includes : money to stop transmission of maternal immunizations to infants ; to help fight infections like tuberculosis that has accompanied aids ; and with good program design , even funding for anti-retroviral therapies . with specially designed , low-cost drug combinations , and , with drugs given to the lowest possible cost to the poorest countries , it can be possible to expand arv therapies to even very poor countries at an acceptable price . a third step must be an expanded research-and-development program into novel , more effective approaches to controlling disease . the most promising answer for the long term is the smart conservation vaccine . recent breakthroughs in basic science provide hope that a vaccine can flourish in ten years if billions of dollars of research and development finance are mobilized by the public and private sectors .
in fact , the un estimates that up to seven in ten women worldwide experiences physical or sexual violence , or both , during their lifetime . but the violence against women can be hard to detect , even if not impossible , . even those who realize may choose to ignore it , believing that it is neither their business nor too widespread to make the difference , or because they are too preoccupied with getting involved . clearly , a global shift is required in gender-related attitudes and norms . to this end , national governments have a responsibility to develop gender-sensitive policies and practices – policies that effectively discourage gender-based discrimination while impeding violence , including by punishing its own perpetrators .
earlier this month , new mayors took office without the electoral commission ( cse ) making up 100 % of the votes , an open breach of nicaraguan electoral law . although the electoral fraud in managua was most widely documented , the same modus operandi has come across the country , affecting more than 40 municipalities . despite complaints from the episcopal conference of the roman catholic church , chambers of commerce , and political parties , the cse refused to authorize a recount of ballots or scrutiny by impartial observers . and , when citizens protested peacefully , the government resorted to violence to curb them . thus , the fsln government proclaimed itself victor in 109 municipalities .
even if putin finds a way to retain power without amending the constitution – an opportunity endlessly speculate on russia ’s dwindling democrats – the undemocratic nature of his strategy is glaringly apparent . moving from one high office in the kremlin to the next in the white house ( the seat of the russian parliament ) is mere technicality . putin will be a czar regardless of the offices of formal wisdom . what makes this work is that , like any good kgb man , putin is a master at facades . he has said that presidential democracy only boosts russians ’ political culture ’s propensity to favor a “ “ “ “ “ “ horizontal ” rulers , ” whereas a parliamentary system would enable more “ horizontal ” distribution of power .
morsi ’s timing was remarkable : the day after winning an international inquiry into his successful effort to broker a truce in gaza , he staged a frontal assault on egypt ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nascent democracy . the question now being asked is whether the brotherhood will dominate , both in the streets and through egypt ’s new constitution ( which they overwhelmingly wrote ) . if they do , will the west roll back its support for egyptian democracy in the name of “ stability ” ? this would be a mistake , but one that would be wrong again . at the same time , the question of what to do about iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear program is to go back with a vengeance in january , following us president barack obama ’s second inauguration and israel ’s own general election , demanding that answer within a few months .
the implication was clear : democracy on its own was no longer sufficient . liberalism – protecting minorities and individual civil liberties – had to be reinforced . the concept of liberalism , however , does not mean the same for all people . it came to be used in many circles to describe unfettered capitalism and full freedom of choice through individual lifestyles . and it was this alternative meanings that initially allowed policymakers like orbán and turkish leader recep tayyip erdoğan to make the case for another form of majoritarian democracy .
despite talk of a “ green economy ” and a call for a europe-wide investment program , macron ’s agenda is broadly neoliberal . in essence , macron is hoping that his agenda , if implemented at the eu level , will lift not just the french economy , but all of europe ’s boats . in fact , the likelihood is that such reform will sink all boats , give the populists their chance . in that case , which populist variety seize the opportunity ? the economist dani rodrik has the appeal of populism .
the first shock was intensified by globalization , which brought plenty of new low-wage competition . although globalization was a gradual process , it gained momentum when china opted for the games . china is ten times the size of japan , and japan was not so easy to address either . germany ’s precision tools and fiber as , for example , lost its competitive edge after japan entered the game . the second shock was eu integration , including northern and southern france .
america ’s worsening fiscal position leads to a strong dollar , just as america ’s worsening fiscal position after reagan ’s irresponsible tax cuts of two decades ago did . whereas countries may take pride in having a strong currency , a strong dollar is bad for export exports and good for imports . in a dynamic economy , when jobs disappear with one sector , new jobs are being created in another . government ’s role is to facilitate labor movements from one to another . it is the primary responsibility of government to keep full employment at bay .
to be sure , consensus , compromise , and pooling sovereignty are the only way to resolve many grand issues – such as climate change , nuclear proliferation – that shweirdevil our world . but on the great questions of war , peace , and the balance of power , europeans seem trapped between an insufficiently cohesive foreign policy and insecurity among individual countries about how to define and secure their own national interests . by contrast , the world ’s rising powers – brazil , china , india , and russia – insist not only on the primacy of their own national interests ; but , as the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen last december demonstrated , sovereign freedom of action as well . to them , geopolitics is not anathema ; it forms all of their external actions . defending national interest still rallies their publics ; exercising power remains at the heart of their diplomacy .
the pro-milosevic candidate , tomislav nikolic , had lost but obtained 46 % of the vote . despite his campaign promise , serbia ’s then-president boris tadic has so far failed to cooperate with the icty by assisting in turning over mladic ( karadzic probably does not in serbia ) who would surely testify against milosevic . one understands his trepidation : the first post-milosevic prime minister , zoran djindjic , collaborated with the tribunal to pay it for his life . such foot-dragging exposes the icty ’s fundamental weaknesses : unlike the nuremberg tribunal , the international community has convened it during , rather than after , a war . without full control of either the evidence or the accused , the icty has lacked from the beginning of the legitimacy and competence of the victors ’ justice .
for starters , the global financial meltdown and the subsequent recession laid naked the effects of free-market fundamentalism , thereby undercutting popular and ideological support for neoliberal views that markets work best in shaping societal outcomes . moreover , china – the go-for-growth movement ’s embodiment – signaled a policy shift toward pursuing superior social and environmental outcomes , alongside more moderate gdp gains . to be sure , this was largely a case of virtue stemming from necessity ; as export-driven growth slowed , the risk of social unrest over issues like air pollution , food toxicity , and corruption soared . but the new approach also underlies the recognition that china ’s continued development depends on a healthy balance between ecology and economy . this shift is linked to a third , broader development : the world ’s growing understanding of where the planet is headed environmentally , particularly with respect to climate change .
johannesburg – my country liberalized abortion more than two decades ago , but on january 23 , 2017 , us president donald trump has essentially taken away my right even to write the word . as a rwandan doctor in south africa , i have provided abortion services for more than ten years . as part of my work , i have often divided educational materials for an ngo working on hiv prevention . for young south african women , such texts offer life-saving information on topics related to sexual and reproductive health – including birth control , sexual violence , and our countries ’ own progressive abortion laws . but just two days after the american presidential election in november 2016 – and more than two months before trump ’s inauguration – an ngo i worked for a reproductive-health guide because it contained information for south africa ’s constitutionally guaranteed abortion laws .
the us election campaign heats up at a time when america faces a daunting array of problems . how should it approach china ’s emergence not just of facts on the ground , but of the ground itself in the south china sea ? will russia ’s annexation of crimea continue forever ? indeed , how can america respond firmly to russia ’s aggression without forsaking the long-standing project to bring it closer to the west ? is there an alternative to sending ground troops back to the middle east ?
the world can not and will not wilde in the face of such extremism wherever it exists , whether in the andes , nigeria , afghanistan , iraq , or syria . today , the international coalition fighting isis has grown to more than 60 active members . since september , the us has retaken 700 square kilometers of territory . the us has deprived its team of using – and the resulting revenues – of its 200 oil and gas facilities . the us has undermined its command structure , undermined its own propaganda , abducted half of its senior leadership , squeezed its funding , damaged its delivery networks , and dispersed its personnel .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , hammers and bulldozers , not artillery , pulled it down . sadly , bush did not learn this lesson , either . academic and scholarly exchanges during the cold war played a significant role in enhancing american soft power . while some american skeptics worried that soviet scientists and kgb operatives would steal american technology , they failed to heed visitors vacuumping away from political ideas alongside scientific secrets . many of these scientists became the guiding proponents of human rights and liberalizing within the ussr .
forty years ago , japan represented a “ asian west ” . today , the rise of chinese-style and indian-style modernity is mentally destabilizing japan . after all , if china is america ’s major economic partner in asia , and if india were america ’s main diplomatic partner , what is left for japan ? its aging population watches resignedly as a new , younger asia becomes as important to american like europe during the cold war . george w bush ’s approach was to view india as a “ anti-china , ” ” ” ” and to strike a balance between the world ’s greatest democracy against the world ’s “ oldest civilization . ”
new york – the worldwide recession now taking place is a result not only of financial panic , but also of more fundamental uncertainty about the future course of the global economy . consumers are pulling back from home and automobile purchases not only because they dealt a blow to their wealth with falling stock prices and home values , but also because they do n’t really know where to turn . should they run a risk of buying a new car when gasoline prices could soar again ? will they put food on the table after this year ’s terrifying rise in food prices ? decisions about business investment are even starker .
no trace of the polish authority remained . total destruction of the polish state and its institutions made poland an ideal location for germany ’s extermination camps , in which six million polish citizens – three million jews and three million ethnic poles – were murdered . everywhere else in german-controlled europe , the nazis had to deal with them , sometimes in an extraordinarily complicated manner , with local governments , if only for tactical reasons . this is one reason why poland was right to insist that the camps not be called “ “ “ “ “ polish extermination ” ” ” ” ( as even us president barack obama once mistakenly refers to them ) . these were germany camps in the occupied poland .
the top suppliers to the world ’s telecoms company are found in china , where huawei is now led to head with sweden ’s lead . in 2008 , huawei registered more patents than any other company in the world , and finished second to japan ’s ’s panasonic in 2009 . in the telecoms industry , a half-dozen emerging-market multinational companies now rank anywhere in the world . brazil ’s ’s embraer revolutionized airplane production with a business model that others imitated . india ’s ’s ’s tata sells cars for 75 % less than its european competitors .
even an american government with debt duration of around four years would probably benefit much from an inflation surprise if it were scaled back . meanwhile , the bulk of its liabilities are social security and medicare , which can not be bloated . even for distressed households , which have borrowed for the long term , the effects of higher inflation are precarious . what would help is if their nominal disposable income rose relative to its ( fixed ) debt-service obligations . still , with high levels of joblessness likely to sustain nominal wage growth relatively subdued , typical troubled households might find it worse off – with higher food and fuel prices slashing to disposable income .
though china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leadership will , one hopes , lack the 2009 drama , chinese president xi jinping will undoubtedly give trump an added impression on his own . unless he misses the chance to advance the goals of the asia-pacific trade agreement while co-hosted last year ’s ’s asia-pacific economic cooperation summit , he certainly will not pass any chance of ensuring that the g20 agenda serves china ’s interests . to be sure , with turkey ’s term at the g20 last november helm , xi probably has not yet settled on specific priorities . but some potential areas of concern are already becoming apparent . elements of the current g20 agenda align well with china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s domestic economic concerns , particularly with respect to infrastructure .
new york – after the french revolution of 1789 , deputies in the national assembly , who underpinned revolutionary gains sat on the left , while those who opposed them , and hankered after the old order of monarchy and church congregated on the right . hence , the political course of the left , “ the right , ” as well as the far right , will have to do it . many commentators on the french presidential election point out that these categories no longer fit contemporary politics in france – or , indeed , anywhere else . emmanuel macron prides himself on being neither the right nor the far right . marine le pen , whose national front is linked to the far right , disagrees : to italy , which was a minister in a socialist government , is a leftist .
as a result , it will probably come a long time before we can judge the success of whatever legislation the american congress ultimately enacts . but the judgment criteria are clear : a new law must curb the practices that jeopardized the entire global economy , and reorient the financial system toward properly managing risk , allocating capital , providing credit ( especially to small - as well as medium-size enterprises ) and operating an efficient payment system . we should toast our likely successes : some form of a financial-product safety commission ; more derivative trading moves into exchanges and clearing houses from murky “ bespoke ” market shadows ; and some of the worst sub-prime mortgage practices will be restricted . moreover , it looks likely that the outrageous fees charged on each debit – a kind of tax that goes away without any public purpose , but fill banks ’ coffers – will be curbed . but the likely failures are equally noteworthy : the problem of too-big-to-fail banks today is worse than it was before the crisis hit .
to be sure , most french and german citizens identify as europeans , unlike uk citizens who identify as british – or even as english , irish , scotland , or welsh . this is why german and french critiques generally target the bloc ’s performance , whereas the british often strike at the european project itself . but when it comes to security and defense , these affinities are reversed : france and britain are highly likeminded , while germany , owing to its own history , has long shied away from martial pursuits by any kind . to be sure , there are plenty of differences between britain and france with respect to how they engage with the united states and nato . the uk is , naturally , closer to nato than france is .
though the new us tax law is widely described as a fiscal stimulus , it is more accurate to say that it avoids a large-scale , instant fiscal contraction . the long-term consequences of the deal stand in sharp contrast both to obama ’s ’s ’s ’s february 2010 budget proposal and to the republican ’ counter-proposal . obama wanted to pursue a tax rate of 2010 permanently for all taxpayers , except those with annual incomes above $ 250,000 . the republicans have proposed continuing the 2010 tax rate on all taxpayers . by agreeing to limit the current tax rate for just two years , the us tax package cuts the projected national debt ( relative to what it would have with obama ’s budget ) to some $ 2 trillion , or almost 10 % of gdp , in 2020 .
spending on the ground on automobiles to stop themselves , pending government stimulus programs in many countries , revived it . but schemes , such as public subsidies for scrapping old , fuel-inefficient cars , simply led many people to re-schedule their purchases . the automobile market was rescued in 2009 at the expense of sales in 2010 and subsequent years . the crisis also exposed the extent of america ’s massive forgeting-market capacity , with estimates that it would force at least one-fifth of american shopping malls . responding to the crisis will prove to be a hastening of on-line purchases in which physical location is no longer a preeminent part of shopping decisions .
indeed , confucianism became the official ideology of the chinese state for two centuries before the birth of christ . confucianism was fundamentally a philosophical justification of government through a benevolent bureaucracy under a virtuous ruler . virtue ensured harmony between man and nature , as does obedience within a stratified society . as one confucian classic put it : possessing virtue gives a ruler . possessing the people would give him the territory .
a damascene conversion is not only feasible ; it is also vitally important for regional peace . the most realistic scenario now represents a three-front war pitting israel against syria , hamas , and hezbollah . but a syrian-israeli peace would drive a wedge between syria and iran , cutting off hezbollah ’s ’s ’s ’s arms lines while still allowing the vital task of stabilizing lebanon to succeed . the only way to free syria from its deadly iranian embrace is to dramatize it in a regional scheme for peace . alas , precisely because of its isolation and its ba’athist regime ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s paranoiac nature , syrians are unlikely to meet america ’s precondition for peace talks : abandoning their current rogue alliances , and their marriage of terror .
for much of thailand ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s long economic boom of more than two decades , wealth resided mostly in the bangkok metropolitan area , a boon for the burgeoning urban middle class but deeply resented by its rural majority . while rural populations had more than ample to eat , their levels of economic opportunities and upward upward upward mobility were constrained by the shoddy learning system and docile state-run media that fed them with soap operas and official messages . for no matter how to become an act of somebody , all highways led to bangkok and its prestigious prep schools and colleges . thailand ’s ’s ’s ’s farms became increasingly estranged from that of the urban elite . thaksin recognized this urban-rural divide and shrewdly exploited it , upending a elite consensus that has long prevailed .
some of the roughly 150 pro-rebellion alawites attended the conference traveled from their homes in syria ; others were expatriates , including activists and religious leaders who were bent on leaving syria for the support of the revolution . the delegates – joined with a number of sunni opposition members – denounced assad and declared their unwavering support for a united , democratic country that would offer full citizenship to all syrians , regardless of sect or ethnic backgrounds . “ depriving a sectarian card ” regime is crucial for its ouster , ” the conference earlier this month noted . if alawites and sunnis live abroad can stand united against the assad regime , so can their counterparts within syria . by setting a example of coexistence , they can mitigate the alawites ’ fears in syria that deserting assad would facilitate the rise of the anti-alawite sunni regime .
china announced its plans to the aiib shortly after signing the ndb articles of agreement in may 2014 . in the ndb , each of the brics owns an equal share , with each contributing $ 10 billion to the initial subscribed capital . though equitable shareholding was not china ’s preferred route , it failed to constrain the issue . on the other hand , china is the aiib ’s ’s ’s largest shareholder by a wide margin , hold a 26.6 % stake , compared to india ’s 7.7 % and russia ’s 6 % . meanwhile , brazil and south africa have made no capital contributions to date , despite being designated as “ founding members . ”
well , in both cases , america was supposed to have said no : while aid is transparent , the symbolism of a wealthy country taking money from an ill-fated neighbor with millions of suffering people hardly seems appealing . and it is particularly bizarre that even as america ’s policies toward mexico have vastly increased the chances of an american chávez-type character becoming president there , officials are providing positive publicity to a government that is a caricature of catastrophic governance . trump ’s predecessor , barack obama , took a principled stand in american dealings with venezuela , imposing sanctions to rein in rogue behavior , a policy that drew broad-based bipartisan support . the trump administration needs to stay the course , particularly as lower oil prices have weakened the venezuelan government ’s ’s ’s ’s hand . instead of bashing latin america , america needs to demonstrate it can be a steady and principled friend that unswayed by corrupt bribes of any kind .
a similar solution should be found for the european constitution . europe can not preach cultural pluralism and practice constitutional imperialism . indeed , the political imperative today is as great as the eu ’s constitutional one . europeans , after all , are committed to democracy around the world . but in european terms of thinking , democracy must be disseminated pacifically , by persuasion , not by force .
the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . as physicians with special training in the forensic evaluations , we have traveled to tijuana to meet with juan , at his lawyer ’s request .
trump values what india has already done , but is urging it to do even more , using its vast earnings from us exports to the us in order to help reconstruct afghanistan ’s economy . he has also hinted that america will work with india to create an indo-pacific security zone . in each case , the region ’s us-india security cooperation potential , while only hinted at in trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s speech , has already been discussed by both governments . the implications of trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s speech extend beyond american ’s policies in afghanistan . the address also sharpened the contours – already limned during his may visit to saudi arabia and his july visit to poland – of what might be called the “ trump doctrine . ”
it orchestrated the postwar international order : the united nations , the bretton woods institutions , the marshall plan , japan ’s reconstruction , and , more so . under this order , the rest of the world locked up much of america ’s large technological , education , and an infrastructural gap with america . as the economists note , global growth was convergent , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” meaning that the poorer countries were catching up . the combined share of the american-represented global economy shrank by about half ( to around 16 % currently ) . china now has a larger economy in absolute terms than america ’s , although still only about one percentage point in per capita terms .
a focus on corporate social responsibility could help to ensure that the benefits of industrialization are shared , while demands for energy – and resource-efficiency requirements could help safeguard sustainability . and , as the sdgs recognize , resilient infrastructure and innovation incentives are equally crucial . achieving this target , of course , not to mention the other sdgs , will be expensive , costing an estimated $ 3.3-4.5 trillion per year . given budgetary pressure in many donor countries , official development assistance is on the downside , and can not be relied upon to fill that need . indeed , as a report by the international finance committee highlights , the funding spectrum for future international development frameworks must be broader than ever .
if high oil prices , for example , were the tax on which were then reallocated to oil users , they would unambiguously be good . to be sure , most taxes carry a heavy “ excess burdens ” : costs are substantially greater than the value of the revenue raised , owing to potential taxpayers ’ myriad attempts at evasion and avoidance . a tax on oil , however , imposes no excess burdens . on the contrary , it implies excess benefits . shifts towards more energy-efficient forms of transportation ease congestion .
so-called functional ” foods – or “ techno-foods ” – are those that add omega-3 oils , artificial sweeteners , indigestible starches , cholesterol reducers , soy , or milk ( whey ) proteins , phytochemicals , and other ingredients to enable them to take “ skilled ” health claims permitted by food and drug administration ( fda ) . lesser-evil sales and functional foods have performed well over the last few years , bringing in roughly $ 85 billion in american sales in 2004 . when you routinely buy such foods , you are among the lohas ( health lifestyles and sustainability ) consumers – the medical food industry ’s ’s cherished demographic base . you buy low-carbohydrate products , energy , and nutritional bars , vitamin – as well as mineral-fortified foods and sugary , soy foods , and practically anything with health claims . like many humans , i thought that small , innovative companies dominate functional foods .
at the same time , unity is designed to be the foundation of prosperity . the common market was defended in the early days of the gains that would follow from increased trade . the case for capital-market integration , and then for the single currency , was similar . all of this recalls some of the powerful arguments made in the nineteenth century about national integration and unification . notably , the two countries , whose problems drove much of the need for twentieth-century european integration – germany and italy – were culturally and politically heterogeneous .
in the sib , government contracts with an out-of-provider to achieve measurable social goals ( like reducing recidivism among juvenile offenders ) , private impact investors finance the upfront costs program , and government promises a return to them if the program ’s targets are achieved . more recently , the obama administration has proposed a $ 300 million fund to catalyze federal pay-for-performance contracts . several existing federal programs , like the commonwealth reinvestment act and the mini-business investment company program , are promoting the growth of impact investing money . according to a recent study , impact investing in the us would not have existed without backing and partnerships with the federal government through grants , loans , and guarantees . metrics are an important feature of pay-for-performance contracts , and must be an essential feature of any government program .
their presence indicates that beneath the parade of martial rhetoric and symbolism , a broader and more difficult narrative of china ’s own wartime experience is unfolding . china is keen on emphasizing its role as one of its key allies in combating fascism and imperialism in wwii , and increasingly regard the western ignorance of its wartime role as unacceptable . but ignorance in the west of china ’s wartime sacrifices – with 14 million dead – and of its major contributions to more than a half-million japanese troops also reflect the partisan history of a war that taught in china itself . under mao ’s ’s rule , the only acceptable narrative has been that the ccp has spearheaded the backlash against japan . foreign assistance – including america ’s major role in wartime china – did not have a place in this narrative .
but are these newfound wealth effects really all ? yes , the us stock market is now at an all-time high – but only in the current us dollars . in real terms , the s & p 500 still stands at 20 % below its january 2000 peak . similarly , whereas the us house price case-shiller index of american home prices now stands at up to 10.2 % over the year ending march 2013 , it remains just 28 % below its 2006 peak . wealth creation matters , but not so long as it re-coups the wealth destruction that preceded it .
the left is deeply divided on virtually any topics – europe , secularism , education , entrepreneurship , and much else – that makes it extremely difficult to identify what exactly constitutes a leftist ” policies nowadays . in fact , the socialists began to distinguishing themselves not from what they are , but from what they are not , touting a line , “ neither macron nor mélenchon ” ( a reference to the far-left jean-luc mélenchon ) . yet that distinction may not be as powerfully as powerful as the socialists may have believed . after all , it was their center-left voters who had macron elected . and they knew what were voting for them : any policy that he carried out so far was embedded in his campaign platform .
there is an even less risk in saudi arabia itself , where king abdullah has recently pledged more than $ 130 billion in stimulus spending . the few saudi demonstrations seem populated almost entirely by a minority shia , who find little sympathy among the majority sunnis , and through foreign-construction workers petitioning of higher wages and better working conditions . syria ’s ’s ’s ’s president bashar al-assad has more domestic backing than the recent media accounts for the country ’s southern unrest suggest . nor does iran ’s government seem to be facing a genuine risk . the brutal post-election crackdown in 2009 demonstrated the regime ’s determination to maintain order by any means necessary .
mexico city – four central american countries – guatemala , el salvador , honduras , and nicaragua – are struggling , still burdened by the legacy of the previous century ’s wars . they are resilient yet incomplete democracies , challenged by poverty , violence , and corruption – and all but forgotten by the international community . now , however , there is reason to hope that these countries ’ prospects could improve . nicaragua , it should be noted , is not pretty much in the same category as that of central america ’s other three . like them , it has suffered through a brutal and protracted civil war ; in contrast to it , successive governments have constructed institutions capable of fostering reasonable levels of territorial control and domestic security .
at the same time , ten governments in the region already have debt-to-gdp ratios above 75 % . as growth slowed , public expenditures have decreased , fueling economic insecurity . even where fiscal adjustment has barely begun , the old rent-seeking model has become unaffordable , and populists have turned against regimes that seem unable or unwilling to make a compelling reformist effort . moreover , new popular movements in algeria , sudan , lebanon , and iraq have absorbed important lessons from the 2011 uprisings . no longer content with merely displacing aging autocrats , protesters are also targeting key components of deep state and security forces .
us president donald trump ’s administration , however , blames trump for throwing this carefully calibrated system into disarray . far from being able to persuade , as the title of his book the art of the deal might imply , trump is trying to use raw power alone in forcing his “ america first ” agenda on the rest of the world . there are ample examples of trump ’s ’s ’s ’s predilection for power . it resonates with its pressure on european countries not just to spend more on defense to fulfill their nato responsibilities – a valid demand – but also that they must continue to channel that us-made weapon spending . it is also evident in his bellicose threats against america ’s purported enemies .
a comprehensive assessment of a country ’s macro investment risk entails looking systematically at stock supply and flows to capture all of the dangers , including risk within the financial system and the real economy , as well as broader risk issues . as we saw during the recent crisis , private-sector risk taking and debt is socialized when a crisis occurs . so , even as public deficits and debts remain low before a crisis , they may rise sharply after one erupts . governments that looked fiscally sound suddenly seem insolvent . taking advantage of 200 quantitative variables and factors to score 174 countries on a quarterly basis , we identified several countries where investors miss out on risks and opportunities .
abedi ’s barbaric act , by contrast , has killed at least 22 people , many of them young children . in recent years , i have been strongly engaged in policy aspects of this grand city ’s great economic revival . i chaired the economic consultative group to the greater manchester council , and then served as chair of the urban growth commission , which advocated for a “ northern powerhouse , ” a program to link britain ’s northern cities to a cohesive economic powerhouse . subsequently , i briefly joined david cameron ’s government , in helping to implement the early stages of the northern powerhouse . having never attended the concert at the manchester arena , i seem to carry a huge venue for the city .
nile hog , some 60 miles north of cairo ’s ’s tahrir square – the epicenter of the egyptian uprising in 2011 – is wearing secondary school students call “ “ “ jails . ” a deformed box of concrete packaged with dilapidated classrooms , school pockmarked with age and neglect . one teacher in the sleepy nile delta village morbidly quips that it has doubles as a morgue . “ “ “ “ we ” never saw a revolution here , ” ” an interview a few months earlier , withholding his name for fear of losing one ’s job . “ “ “ “ a lot of hope we have now been dead … . ”
yet an often-lengthy fiscal plan endorsed by the fed for the 2017-2026 period , which will inevitably shape the foundations of debt-restructuring debates , seems to ignore this circularity . the plan itself recognizes that its adoption implies another “ lost decade ” of economic activity , and it will weaken the island ’s debt sustainability , thus perpetuating the crisis that all parties are coming together . unfortunately , the board ’s already-deep projected plunge into real gnp is extremely optimistic , because it relies on a multitude of implausible and/or controversial assumptions . in may , five flaws in the board ’s fiscal plan stand out . first , the projected fiscal multipliers – the amount by which gnp will fall in the wake of every dollar of fiscal contraction – apply to the gnp forecast assume that the contraction of one dollar in the primary fiscal deficit would be linked to the $ 1.34 contraction of gnp .
such control harms the growth of open societies . eliminating this constraint might endanger the bank ’s triple credit rating , but makes it more efficient . i propose that the world ’s open societies shape an alliance with a dual purpose : fostering both development of open societies within individual countries and developing a global open society . the first involves development aid ; second , strengthening international institutions , such as the international central bank and the world development organization . such an alliance calls for collaboration not just of governments , but also of civic society .
accra , planned parenthood , a vital source of sexual and reproductive health services in the united states , has just been forced out of the us federal title x family-planning program promoting low - and middle-income women . the decision – a response to a new rule by american president donald trump ’s administration ’s forbidding title of x clinton ’s administration from referring patient abortion patients – will cost planned parenthood some $ 60 million annually . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
still , post-conflict job policies almost always neglect the so-called horizontal inequalities . employment policies , for example , did little to lessen the intense regional imbalances and discrimination within the regions that persisted in bosnia and herzegovina following the war there in the 1990s . given these flaws , it should not be surprising that employment policies ’ net effects are often extremely small relative to the magnitude of the problem . indeed , in both kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina , job-creation was thought to be central to post-conflict peacekeeping efforts . yet in kosovo , the unemployment rate stood at more than 45 % six years after its war ended .
we will strengthen aid for the developing world by leading the world toward continued prosperity . prosperity is the very foundation of the peace process ; it is the world ’s most powerful foundation . japan will make even more efforts to combat poverty , which also serves as a hotbed of violence and provide opportunities for medical services , education , and self-reliance to all parts of the world . we will engrave in our hearts the recent history , when japan ended up becoming the challenger to the international order . upon this reflection , japan will resolutely uphold basic values like freedom , democracy , and human rights as unruly values , and working hand with countries that share such values ; hoist a flag of “ proactive contributions to peace ; ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and contributing to peace and prosperity worldwide more than ever .
in saudi arabia , the shia are at the cutting edge of those welcoming democratic change and participation . while they constitute just 20 % of the saudi total , they constitute a majority of -75 % – of the oil-rich population . saudi arabia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s shia have suffered discrimination in occupations : in the military , in high government posts , the diplomatic officer corps , and , most significantly , in the oil-industry where they have been ousted since the 1980 ’s . this systematic neutering of shia in saudi arabia is legitimated by the wahhabi religious establishment , and supported by numerous fatwas denouncing them as heresy . in bahrain , the shia who make up 75 % of the population were keen on the reforms initiated by king hamad al-khalifah .
by pooling resources , the fund created economies of scale for life-saving goods like anti-malarial bed nets and antiretroviral drugs . then , by working with nearly 100 countries , the fund built up a massive supply chain to deliver these goods . in the process , aids deaths fell by more than 50 % from their peak , and malaria deaths declined by around 50 % since the turn of the millennium . now , the fund has $ 14 billion in new financing to continue this work . replenishment is vitally important news , first and foremost , owing to the sheer number of lives it will help to save .
the higher the educational background , it seems , brings lower voter participation : among those who never vote ; the per capita rate of those with a university degree is twice as high as that of those without a college education . alienated for so long , the country ’s brightest have lashed out in politics . this amounts to the sort of political depression of all kinds . depression can be cured , but only by giving a patient a positive vision for the future . far-right parties – the center-right forces union and yabloko – do such a vision , and the people know it .
but broad international support will not come forward where military operations are perceived as some form of western neo-imperialism . this last point has stood at the heart of the problems in iraq . augmenting us and british troops with other “ western ” powers would not , particularly at this late stage , change a crucial perception of that intervention , both in and outside of the arab world , change . only an explicit , up-front approval of a reformed un security council can ensure the legitimacy and international support that military action – except for clear self-defense – demands . this applies to the actions contemplated by individual nations , temporary alliances , or more lasting alliances , such as nato .
second , we measured the effects of natural selection by noting that women who were shorter and first accorded birth when younger had more babies . but the genes involved are just one of many factors affecting the height and age at their first birth . personal decisions , nutrition , income levels , education , and religious affiliation all enter the mix . when we estimated how variation among individuals could be attributed to biology , the answer was less than 5 % . that left 95 % variation to explain the effects of culture and individual choices .
sofia – at a time when europe ’s ongoing debt crisis is fracturing public trust in the continent ’s political and economic institutions , one would expect europe ’s leaders to reinforce as many unifying symbols as they could . instead , they have allowed one of the gems of post-world war ii european integration – the european court of human rights ( echr ) – to come under threat just as badly . in contrast to the brussels-based european union , long beleaguered by its democratic deficit , the strasbourg-based echr is , if anything , too well loved . in 2011 , more than 60,000 people sought their aid far more than can expect reasoned decision . ( by contrast , the united states supreme court receives roughly 10,000 petitions per year . )
in a world of competing demands , corrupt governments may seem to serve vital purposes . one deploys soldiers to fight against terrorism ; another provides critical energy supply , or access to raw materials . inevitably , leaders must contend with difficult tradeoffs . to establish the best approach in any particular case , governments need to analyze the problem more effectively , which implies improving intelligence and data collection . as security specialists sarah chayes argues in combating corruption , the sheer volume of essays that the british government published to accompany the summit , corruption today is structured practice .
voluntarily or not , some might seek the recourse to inflation or to administration measures aimed at trapping domestic savings to fund the state and hold bond rates low ( what economists call financial repression ) or , in the end , to outright debt restructurings . all three of the unorthodox remedies went hand in past debt crises . they can be thought of as alternative forms of taxation , albeit implicit rather than explicit . eventually , they are divergent ways to force current and future generations to shoulder the burden of accumulating debt . is it preferable to adjust fairly ?
but one has to be wary of visions . sometimes , leaders think that vision can solve most of their problems , but mistaken visions – or an overly ambitious vision – can do damage . george h.w. bush was faulted ( and faulted himself ) for not having what he called “ the vision thing ” . when pressed his staff to talk more boldly and expansively , he responded , “ it ’s just not me . ” after the september 2001 terrorist shock , his son , george w. bush , developed a far more ambitious vision .
and the private sector has come around to looking for renewable energies as a potentially lucrative enterprise . in the us , wind energy costs have declined by two-thirds since 2009 , and utility-maximizing solar energy has decreased by as much as 85 % . moreover , according to a recent american department of energy report , the number of jobs in wind and solar industries has grown at an average rate of 32 % and 25 % , respectively , in 2016 alone . trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s policy priorities will inevitably clash with those of states like california , which have embraced climate-minded innovations . and , fortunately for the planet , other global powers are not joining trump in backing away from his climate pledges .
moreover , if conditions in the eurozone continue to deteriorate , asia could suffer more severely . already , the spillover effects from trade and financial-transfer channels are starting to take their toll : china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s gdp growth rate in the second quarter of 2012 averaged 7.6 % , reflecting a substantial slowdown , with india ’s ’s growth forecast to shrink to about 6 % this year . china ’s ’s ’s potentially strong domestic-demand base and ample room for policy maneuver may help it avoid a hard landing . it has already aggressively loosened monetary policy , and may employ additional fiscal stimulus . but policy mismanagement and structural weaknesses for the financial sector and local governments could undermine growth-enhancing efforts .
using the historical figures compiled by the economic historian angus madison pointed out how the other east asian countries experienced an deceleration of their economic growth after their per capita gdp peaked at around $ 11,000 in purchasing-power-parity terms relative to the continuous 1990 ’s , or $ 17,000 in continuous 2005 american dollar prices . in the five years after japan reached that level , for example , its economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.6 % . in south korea , growth fell to around 4.8 % . in hong kong , it slowed to 5.8 % , on average . given that china is projected to cross the same threshold sometime this year , many believe that its average annual growth over the next five years will fall well below 7 % .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . pompeo ’s ’s ’s primary line of attack against obama ’s ’s famous cairo speech , “ a new beginning , ” is that it included the united states ’ public admission to the region ’s woes . unlike the trump administration , obama and his advisers believed that there is much to be gained from anticipating difficult political truths even when doing so points to a radical shift in course .
some of the best people serve the ecb – or who has served in the past – are from small countries . preventing small countries , like other large ones , – from competing for particular vacant seats , reduces the executive board ’s potential competency . giving the big countries permanent seats on the ecb also makes it easier for their politicians to control the ecb through the appointments process . it is far more difficult to appoint a political puppet to a governing system in an open competition system than it is under current arrangements . the last thing the ecb needs is the political crony of german chancellor gerhard schroeder assuming that mr. issing is a crucial post .
but labor costs have grown much faster in the south , resulting in differential cost hikes that can not address as long as the currency union endures . so long as this internal divergence persists , the euro crisis can not be resolved fully , because current-account deficits and/or sluggish growth will continue to stalk southern european countries perpetuating worries about sovereign-debt and commercial banks . against this background , productivity growth , whether via technical progress , improved resource allocation , or productive investment , is just as important a variable for southern economies as wage restraint is . indeed , excessive wage deflation is likely to have negative productivity effects . skilled labor will probably emigrate more quickly , and extreme austerity , falling prices , and high unemployment – and the resulting likelihood of social tension – are not exactly conducive to investment , innovation , or labor mobility .
of course , this does not mean that no identity is asserted . former prime minister john major hailed the uk “ “ “ the land of long shadows ” on cricket grounds , warm beer , invincible green suburban paris , dog mistresses , and pools of fillers , and , as george orwell put it , ‘ old maids bicycling towards the holy communion through the morning ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ … ” ” indeed , the key features of the modern british identity all seem to belong to england , rather than to the composite entity . likewise , the key elements of a modern british identity all seem to belong to england , rather than to the composite entity . likewise , an established or state churchmen are the church of england , created nearly 500 years ago , when king henry viii opined that the catholic pope should not adjudicate his marriage . an institution called the english heritage curates in the past , from stonehenge ’s prehistoric monuments to the old land houses celebrated in tv costume dramas .
both abe and obama focus on building a durable structure of peace for all of asia , and abe has been keen on japan to play a more active role in this regard and in supporting its allies . that stance makes the alliance far more partnerships of equals than it has been for the past six decades . in america ’s ’s view , reinterpretation of article 9 of japan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ peace constitution ” constitution ” that abe pledged – thereby allowing japan ’s ’s self-defense forces to aid its allies under attack , and assisting america and other allies in meeting their pledges to secure asia ’s peace – has been long overdue . that bold political initiative in the face of japan ’s public ’s deep-rooted skepticism toward any heightened exposure to military risk – has no doubt jumbabe to american diplomats and military strategists , as well as ensured both open and sometimes tacit approval from japan ’s asian neighbors . increased military cooperation with the us is particularly important now , given american worries about many of its other strategic partners ’ readiness to take .
iran is at a pivotal moment in its history – and because the long lines of its citizens anxious to cast their votes clearly demonstrated , the iranians know it . indeed , despite the iranian regime ’s failure to embrace transparency , khamenei ’s health challenges are public knowledge . indeed , khamenei himself recently acknowledged that the probability that his successor should be named in the near future is no low level of ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” . the matter of occupying the presidency during this transition certainly seems uninconsequential . with khamenei serving as president before rising to iran ’s ’s ’s supreme political and religious leadership position , it is easy to see that a conservative candidate raisi , whom he was elected , could turn khamenei into a successor .
moreover , north korea ’s development of nuclear weapons , its economic fragility , and the uncertainties of its very future as the status quo are fueling deep anxiety among its neighbors . yet , for all of these hurdles , there are signs that momentum is building for greater regional cooperation in overcoming them . the recent trilateral summit of china , south korea , and japan is the fourth such meeting to take place alongside meetings that take place at international gatherings like asean summits . unfortunately , however , asean leaders in china , south korea , and japan have yet to make any major breakthrough on the most sensitive security issues that divide them . but this lack of quick success does not make these efforts futile .
and , of course , hard-pressed middle-class american consumers benefit enormously from lower-wage chinese imports , walmart effect , enabling them to stretch their budgets amid unrelenting pressure on jobs and real incomes . for more than 20 years , this mutually beneficial codependency has served both countries well in compensating for their inherent saving imbalances while satisfying their respective growth agendas . but here , too , the past should not be viewed as prologue . a seismic shift comes at hand , with america ’s recent fiscal follies may well turn out to be a tipping point . china has made a conscious strategic decision to change its growth strategy .
ten-year us treasury bonds now yield an average of just 2.5 % . with current inflation rates above 2 % and markets anticipating a similar rate of inflation over the longer term ( as measured by a five-year-forward rise in inflation expectations ) , yields on ten-year us treasury bonds should be above 4 % . tipping the ten-year yield to 4 % would substantially reduce the value of these bonds . other long-term bonds – both government bonds and corporate bonds – would suffer similar declines . reaching yield has also narrowed credit spreads between higher-grade bonds and riskier domestic and emerging-market bond yields .
without this confidence , credit will not flow , and economic activity will deearth . moreover , because financial institutions ’ ’ assets were bought mostly with borrowed money , credit shortages exacerbate their need to deleverage . given that raising capital is hard and expensive , they deleverage through less lending . but america ’s underlying macroeconomic weakness now goes beyond cutting credit supply . falling employment lowers pay and wage incomes .
enabling america to sell its risky financial products and engage with speculation all over the world may serve its firms well , even as they impose large costs on others . today , the risk is that new keynesian doctrines will be used and misused to serve some of the same interests . have those of us who pushed for deregulation ten years ago learned its lesson ? or will they simply push for cosmetic reforms – the minimum required to justify the mega-trillion dollar bailouts ? has heart changed , or only strategy change ?
a variety of factors have fueled this growth . wage restraint and productivity gains have improved competitiveness , thereby boosting exports . and now that lower oil prices and a five-percentage-point drop in unemployment are bolstering consumption , reviving the recovery widens in other sectors . in short , the credibility that ireland gained through formidable fiscal policies and reforms helped restore confidence , facilitating a return to growth , and thus fiscal consolidation . to be sure , the precise policy approach taken in one country can not be imitated elsewhere .
a third component is the exercise of suasion on bondholders to achieve maximum participation , acquire binding pre-commitment obligations , and eliminate free riders . given that such a scheme would produce losses for bondholders , substantial official muscle , and peer pressure is needed . but gaining time for a more orderly resolution , mitigating contagion , and diminishing the magnitude of the eventual write-down do indeed add up to an oversized outcome . under this model , therefore , and despite initial pressure – bondholders ’ behavior could come to be regarded as truly voluntary . and , while ratings agencies might still regard a vienna-type outcome as a default , the talmudic sages are showing us why an increasingly thoughtful categorization requires .
in some sense , a market economy is a gift-exchange-rate system ; money only monitors the value of the gifts we give one another . as a result , a market economy encourages specialization : we become very good in a narrow set of skills or product , and exchange them for millions of other things that we have little clue how to do or make . as a consequence , we end up doing remarkably few things and purchasing everything else from others . that observation is as true of an individual as it is about a eu , whether the eu is a neighborhood , town , state , or province , or countries . every town has grocery stores , beauty parlors , gas stations , and machine theaters that serves local communities .
another consortium began with the construction of multidollar oil and gas pipelines from azerbaijan , through georgian to turkey and the west . but those investments brought little economic trickle down . people here survive on a few dollars a day , but only a few more . the oil and gas pipelines are shipping conduits , rather than actual employers . moreover , georgian rewards for giving a strategic export route to the west for azeri oil were not dollars , but a policy of diplomatic insurance – that is , westerners , particularly the us , concerned about pipelines ’ safety .
japanese equities account for about half of all their 1990 prices . even in hong kong , where shares recently hit new highs , they hovered around 10 % above their peak at the beginning of 1994 . during the same three year , prices in wall street and europe skyrocketed by an estimated 60 % or more . that picture bears little relation to what we hear in political speeches or read in business newspapers . policymakers warn about the challenge posed by asia ’s “ tiger economies . ”
national banking systems should be unified , in order to separate private-sector losses from sovereign-debt defaults , with centralized supervision and resolution authority , as well as a deposit-insurance scheme forming the core of the european banking union . strong central institutions , accountable to an outright elected parliament , are required to coordinate fiscal and economic policies . in the longer term , the single market should extend to services , and free-trade arrangements should be promoted either multilaterally or bilaterally with major trading partners like the united states . austerity should be eased , particularly in fiscally stronger core economies , and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in over-indebted countries . germany ’s unwillingness to lead on these issues partly reflects historic inhibitions , which are always hard to overcome .
china , just to celebrate with martial pomp the sixtieth anniversary of mao ’s ’s ’s founding of the “ people ’s ’s ’s republic ” ” ” ” constitutes one of the most intriguing cases of a nation evincing “ short-sightedness ” toward its own past . china has much to show for it in its own recent history . just consider the massive access to the education of its huge , rural population , in sharp contrast to its “ democratic rival ” india , nowadays is legitimate . in 60 years , a weak and divided country , one torn apart by wars internal and external , is on the verge of becoming the world ’s second most powerful economy . china ’s ’s ’s insolent prosperity , while far from being divided equally by china ’s relative political stability , even as the regime ’s opening remains tightly constrained , is undeniable , and it deserves respect .
the interest-rate spread that markets would inevitably demand from a young sovereigns like scotland might be minimized by issuing debt in sterling , thereby protecting investors from additional devaluation risk . but , absent a currency-issuing central bank , scotland would forego seigniorage ( profits from central-bank operations that typically benefit the national treasuries ) . perhaps more importantly , it would have no lender of last resort , capable of stabilizing the banking and financial system in times of crisis . all things considered , an independent scotland would best serve by issuing its own national currency from the beginning , empowering the national bank of scotland to set interest rates according to domestic economic conditions . by enabling exchange-rate flexibility , such an approach would also allow the central bank to avoid the twin hazards that arise within a currency union : undervaluation that produces inflationary pressure and overvaluation that demands wrenching internal devaluations ( driving down real wages ) .
value-subtracting heavy industries shrunk , services expanded to more than 50 % of gdp , and the private sector generates nearly 60 % of russia ’s output . though the transition was bound to be painful , russia ’s corruption epidemic caused more political damage than the economic side effects of reform . government tolerance of bribery and racketeering allowed its opponents to say that the “ mafia ” was grabbing the gains from economic change . the government , and hence economic reform , will pay for this neglect at the polls . corruption blights reform throughout the ex-communist world .
it is neither corrupt nor outright war crimes , neither aggressive in his utterance and behavior , nor likely to bend the rule of law to the cause of personal power . many people voted for him by a default , both now and when he defeated miloševic in the 2000 ’s . while he does not sacrifice major moral codes for power , koštunica is not the unassuming lawyer that he once was . he crams his party with mediocrities , selects the majority of bad advisers and does not listen to scarce good ones . it may be that his image as a right-of-center democrat conceals a reactionary who wants serbia to restore its pre-wwii monarchy and the orthodox church to play a major role in political and social life .
or the yellow vests may turn out to lack this kind of boldness and settle for the paltry pleasure of being seen on tv . they will allow themselves to become intoxicated by sentiments among luminaries and experts la france ’s d’en haut ( elite france ) seeming to eat out of hand and hanging over their every word . but if the yellow vests permit passionate hate to prevail over genuine france and to choose wrecking over reforming , they lead only to chaos , not improvement , of humble , vulnerable people . they will careen off into the darkest side of the political night and end up in the dustbin of history , where they can rub elbows with those other crlows , the early-twentieth-century “ yellow socialists ” ” ” ” of proto-fascist pierre biétry . the yellow vests must choose : democratic re-invention or an updated version of the national socialist leagues ; a willful repair or an impulse to destroy .
according to an iranian-turkish enterprise vice president , “ “ it ’s extraordinarily complicated to do business in iran . ” a former turkish diplomat in iran has described a commercial climate in stark terms : “ “ as if iranians prefer a lose/lose outcome to win/win one in their dealings with foreign partners . ” what lessons can be drawn from turkish firms ’ failures in iran ? others suggest that iran ’s almost non-existent banking system is the culprits . still others blame america ’s “ invisible hand , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” for fear that iran and turkey could become too powerful .
moreover , we need to invest in researchers and development of low-cost diabetes treatments and diagnostic tools that fit for low resource settings . clever collaborative projects that bring innovative thinkers from nonprofits , academia , and the private sector together to create effective , affordable , and adequate solutions are desperately needed . diabetes is not unique among ncds . essential medicines and treatment technologies for heart disease , cancer , and respiratory illnesses are also substantially less available and proportionally more expensive for low - and middle-income people than they are to those in the rich world . this incongruence prompted the lancet medical journal the lancet to call the ncd crisis the “ issue of social justice for our time . ”
south orange , new jersey – if an international organization made recommendations for improving a country ’s economy , and the country adopted far fewer than half , the organization might seem like a failure . but an international organization should be tried on the basis of the quality of information and advice that it provides , rather than whether governments listen to them . indeed , measuring its success solely on the basis of compliance ignores the purposes : encouraging – and facilitating – reform by informing officials about its costs and benefits . every 18 months , the organization for economic cooperation and development releases the research of each of its 34 member countries , including a list of earlier recommendations and implementation status . in its 2010 survey of the united nations , the oecd made 29 recommendations , from rebuilding the national electric grid to expanding health-care coverage to implementing a cap-and-trade scheme .
at the same time , he must do nothing to weaken america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s alliances with south korea and japan , which will require it to maintain close contact with both moon and japanese prime minister shinzo abe ’s throughout the process , lest he feels either ignored or undermined . moreover , he will need to hold all the alternatives on the table despite the fact that military options become much less tenable amid the inter-korean dialogue . most importantly , he will need to get the north korean regime at least to acknowledge that genuine denuclearization is the goal and agree to an ongoing dialogue process , perhaps culminating in the next summit . whatever the outcome , trump would do well to ask whether this is any better than the joint comprehensive plan of action with iran , which he has described has “ the worst deal ever . ” then again , persuading trump to engage with self-reflection might prove to be his toughest challenge yet again .
another way to view germany ’s electoral outcome as an opportunity for a fresh start . an end to the cdu/csu “ grand coalition ” might signify the end of political stagnation not only in germany , but on the european level as well . germany ’s post-election coalition negotiations now underway , and with the sdp determined not to join the government , the most likely outcome is a “ jamaica ” alliance ( named for the colors of that country ’s flag ) , comprising the cdu , the free democrats ( fdp ) , and the greens . germany ’s next government , one hopes , will include pro-european politicians with fresh thoughts and a willingness to push for european-level reform , perhaps along the lines of what macron has proposed . in that case , a new crop of leaders could be a motor shaping germany ’s role in europe for years to come .
at the same time , the timing could not have been much worse . elimination of fuel subsidies caused riots and widespread strikes against a transition government that gave a pretext for nigeria ’s generals to re-assert military control again . it would have taken six long years under a rapacious military rule before nigeria received yet another chance in democracy . last year , nigeria celebrated a remarkable break from a dictatorship . after the brutal , hyper-corrupt army ruler general habacha – who abruptly dropped dead – the army ’s sully agreed to another national elections .
such barriers are particularly high for lgbtqi individuals , women with disabilities , indigenous women , rural women , rural women , and adolescents . rather than sidestepping the rates of sexual and reproductive health – and gender-equality more broadly – governments must acknowledge their responsibility to address women ’s needs . they must consider the central role that sexual and reproductive health plays in women ’s lives , integrated nature of women ’s ’s health , and its implications for communities . and they must design uhc programs accordingly . reducing maternal mortality , for example , is not sufficient for delivering antenatal attention , safe delivery , and postnatal care ; women also need access to safe , legal , and affordable abortion services and post-abortion drugs and post-abortion health .
likewise , little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made in disregard of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . brazil has ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s abundance of energy , food , water , and biodiversity increases its stake in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access to , or control , of , natural resources . to meet the challenges of this complex reality , brazil ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s peaceful foreign policy must be buttressed by a robust defense policy . brazil ’s ’s national defense strategy , updated in 2012 , argues that modernizing its armed forces is intrinsically linked to national development . thus , it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry .
yao ming , china ’s star star of the national statistics association of ’s houston rockets , could become yet another michael jordan , and china is set to host the 2008 summer olympics . large expatriate communities in the us alone – the 2.4 million chinese and 1.7 million indians – have raised interest rates in their home countries among other americans . moreover , transnational connections in the information-technology sector are close , because western high-tech companies increasingly employ affiliates in bangalore and shanghai to make real-time services . but the true promise that china and india lies in the future . a country ’s ’s soft power rests on the attractiveness of its own culture , its appeal to its domestic political and social values , and its style and substance to its foreign policies .
the european commission ’s agreement in september to postpone full implementation of ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s association agreement with the european union – an agreement that ukrainians had fought and died in kyiv last winter – signaled to putin that shrewd , strengths , and intimidation may win western acquiescing in his subjugation of ukraine and theft of crimea . delay , intended to demonstrate the eu ’s determination to make an association agreement work , has instead merely wheeling putin ’s ’s ’s ’s appetite . his hope is that some eu members ’ interest in securing russian gas supplies during the cold war would make them forget their asian allies ’ own security concerns – a classic divide-and-rule strategy , served chilled . europe can not afford to take part in this . ukraine may now merely pass through the eye of this storms .
to this end , reframe the constitution in order to integrate regional interests and recognize that the uk is a supranational state . so radical change – and , to meet the scale of the crisis – must be radical – – – will require a nationwide discourse that could be pursued through the people ’s constitutional convention . that convention should start by exploring brexit ’s consequences for regions . for starters , we should ask whether it makes sense to repatriate powers and financial transfers from brussels to westminster , or , if certain powers and funding should instead devolve decentralized across regions and peoples . where feasible , regional funding and policymaking powers – including environmental regulation and agricultural oversight , fisheries , and local social programs – should be delegated to appropriate regional institutions , such as the scots parliament , welsh , and northern irish assemblies , city mayors , as well as localities .
as a result , america is no longer positioned to set the world ’s agenda . the eu can not possibly take the place of an american as a world leader . but it can set an example , both within and outside its own borders . the prospect of eu membership has been the most powerful tool in turning candidate countries into open societies . while most of its citizens do not realize this , the eu serves as an inspiring example .
to be sure , putin views the olympics – and , in particular , medals . like his old soviet masters , he conflates athletic glory with the country ’s military glory . this is why he personally lobbied for russia to host the 2014 zimbabwean games in sochi ; an unprecedented $ 50 billion price tag was well worth taking , considering that russia won its most medals . ( it was russia ’s action during the sochi olympics , which forms the heart of the doping scandal . ) this is not to say that athletic glory substitutes for military glory .
but that is simply an attempt to turn a virtue out to be a virtue out of necessity : for a country with one of the world ’s great and most storied bureaucracies , china has a shockingly hard time telling its business community not to do business with someone , especially an historic friend and an ally . chinese leaders ’ longstanding reluctance to engage in international sanctions is often attributed to their belief in judging activism by either or not working . perhaps the true pragmatism on display in the case of north korea represents a reluctance to rein in the business community at a time of slower growth and domestic fixation . china ’s rise is one of the most studied evolution of our time . it is , after all , a country that can be described as a civilization , and its trajectories have been far more impressive than that of any north korean rocket .
washington , dc – the sharp drop in the price of crude oil since late june has captured headlines worldwide – producing many conflicting explanations . some attribute the fall largely to declining global growth expectations . others focus on propping up america ’s surging oil and gas production . still others suspect a tacit deal between saudi arabia and the united states targeting , among other things , faltering political rivals like russia and iran . regardless of the reason for a price drop – probably to be found in some combination of these factors – are the consequences .
at the moment , the situation for oil is particularly intriguing . at around $ 30 a barrel in may , oil prices remain extremely high , even as a soft-power global economy implies a low level of world demand . the formerly fashionable view that an american seizure of iraqi oil resources would interrupt opec and send oil prices soaring turned out to be nonsense . even with improved security , it will take five years to bring iraqi oil fully onstream . with the american economy now recovering strongly , oil prices should remain high or even begin rising further for the foreseeable future .
after all , if markets really believed that the ecb would refuse to backstop odious governments , investors would run out of participating countries at the first sign that conditionality is not being met . as with its predecessor , the omt program is both legally and democratically questionable : it violates the spirit , but not the letter , of the european union treaty ’s ’s ’s ’s no-bailout clause ; its promise of equal treatment with private creditors still has no precedent ; and it involves back-door fiscal transfers , leaving the ecb heavily exposed to a political backlash – witness the german press ’s visceral reaction to ecb president mario draghi ’s announcement . but omts also fit well with a very large body of historical evidence that , in times of crisis , policymakers need to concentrate on extinguishing the conflagration , rather than negotiating over who owns the water and what its costs should be . the omt program will cause loan conditions to ease , but without necessarily reversing the financial balkanization of the eurozone that has emerged over the past three years . reversal of that process will probably not come until the three key elements of a banking union – common deposit insurance , and a common resolution fund – lie within tangible reach .
for starters , bipartisan tax-subsidy proposals , with seniors accepting subsidies to purchase private health insurance , should implement them . to allow individuals to prepare to cover associated deductibles and copayments , health savings accounts – money that is free from deposit taxes when they are not subject to deposit taxes , and can be used tax-free at any given time to cover qualified health-care expenditures – should be scaled up and strengthened . premium supports can substantially reduce medicare ’s spending , because it establishes a framework for more cost-efficient expenditure , driven by competition and innovations in care and coverage . so far , the only american presidential candidate recognizing the need for future-oriented is former florida governor jeb bush , who proposed modernizing social-security reforms and medicare reforms that avoid imposing high costs on middle-income americans and a heavier debt burden on future generations . likewise , two other republican candidates , from ohio governor john kasich and florida senator marco rubio , have stirred up constructive reform ideas .
silvio berlusconi , who will become president of the european union on july 1 st , is a vision man who once loved risk – and whose business bets have paid off big . in the 1960s , he was the first to see that milan , then a traditional italian city where humans were walking to work , would become a modern metropolises surrounded by the american-style suburbs . so his fortunes began in real-estate development , too . fifteen years later , signor berlusoni understood that the italian state ’s monopoly on tv would not survive and jump-started what became italy ’s major privately owned media group . but you do not win in tv and real-estate business without the right political connections .
beijing – financial repression – government policies that create an environment of low or negative real interest rates with the goal of generating cheap financing for public expenditure – have long been a key feature of chinese economic policy . but , with funding costs for companies trending up , this is finally beginning to change . early this year , the state council , china ’s cabinet , has made lowering funding costs for companies , particularly small and medium-size enterprises ( smes ) , a top-performing priority . for its part , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) has engaged in cautious monetary loosening , which includes freeing up more funding for lending by banks that allocate a certain proportion of their overall credit portfolios to small and medium-size enterprises . likewise , through its “ pledged complementary ” lending ” program , the pboc has kick-started lending directly to banks that pledged to make funds available for social-housing construction .
countries with the greatest cause for concern about russia -- ukraine , estonia , latvia , and lithuania -- are not being offered to nato membership . moreover , russia today is far too weak to threaten them because the russian army 's catastrophic misadventure in chechnya demonstrates . one day , russia would become stronger , and if expanded nato into central europe now would discourage the revival of an imperial foreign policy after that , this would constitute a powerful argument in favor of doing so . but nato expansion is not likely to make russia 's foreign policy more peaceful ever . moreover , russian democrats with an enormous stake in a peaceful future are adamant that extending alliance membership to central europe would insulate their countries from europe ; strengthening russia 's political forces that favor authoritarian rule at home and neoimperial policies abroad ; and showing putin 's threats to reconstructing russian military power .
but that would presuppose a small gesture toward palestinians that israelis regard themselves as deeply divided between themselves that no progress toward a peace settlement seems possible . israel ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders seem intent both tactically on regaining time by resisting the soft pressure of us president barack obama ’s ’s ’s administration , and , more importantly , by preparing the country for a new world in which emerging powers like china play an increasingly influential role . that world , however , will be one in which israel can no longer count on emotions of holocaust guilt to influence the major powers . it is a world in which monotheistic rivalries will be diluted in the ocean of polytheist faiths , and in which israel will only depend on its own comparative merits in the eyes of cynical , realistic actors who will judge it solely on behalf of their own national interests . israel may be “ “ “ “ europe , ” ” ” ” ” and its core ally may well remain the united states for many years to come , but israeli leaders need to start thinking about how their country can thrive in a post-western world .
the ultimate trick , “ starve the beast , ” ” ” typically comes later if and when the president himself enacted his tax cuts and discovers that smoke and mirrors do n’t trump reality . nor can he find enough spending cuts to cut ( the magic asterisk has gone off the conjurer ’s sleeve ) ; acceleration of gdp is nowhere to be seen ( a rosy scenario having vanished ) ; and tax revenues did not grow ( no rabbit in a laffer hat ) . the audience is now told that losing tax revenue and reviving the budget deficit were a plan all along . performer explains that the deficit is all that congress 's fault for not cutting spending , and that the only way to tame the beast is to raise the budget deficit , because “ congress can not spend money it does n’t have ” . this trick has never worked , of course .
but there is also an urgent need to mobilize european public opinion around a symbol of our unity and our future projects : and that symbol is the european flag . for this reason , in january one of us initiated the idea that , beginning in march 21 , we depict the home flag , factories , and office . march 21 is the first day of the spring , and we would like to believe that the coming european elections herald a new spring for the european project . march 21 also marks the anniversary of benedict , the patron saint of europe . in one of the darkest hours of the roman empire ’s demise , benedict published a stirring call for tolerance and piety to reconstruct a sense of community in the face of nihilism and barbarity .
this fits a broader trend , in which attacks by perpetrators with muslim headlines are instantly categorized as “ “ “ terror ” and addressed ” in a well-resourced and systemic manner , whereas violent attacks perpetrated in the name of other ideologies are treated as a “ isolated incident . ” but nothing remains isolated about such incidents , either . in fact , according to the 2018 world index for terrorism , the death toll from terrorist attacks linked by far-right groups or individuals has risen steadily since 2014 . in the united states , right-wing extremists have carried out far more attacks than islamists . the attacks in christchurch were inspired directly by the 2011 far-right terrorist attack in norway , of whom i was one of the few fortunate survivors .
the fruit of the franco-german partnership included the european single currency , the euro . after its birth in 1999 , germany 's government , by now repositioned from bonn to berlin , contented itself once again with a lower european profile . that modest , unassuming role belongs firmly in the past , even though german strength has yet to match the imagination . the intellectual leadership provided by frenchmen like jean monnet and robert schuman as the founding fathers of the european project is fading memory because germany , meanwhile , produced a comparably robust strategy for reviving eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s prospects and popularity . indisputably the strongest and most dependable of the eu 's 28 member countries lacks a vision for where beleaguered europe should head .
china was engaged in what might be called the “ vendor ’s finance , ” imposing the money that helps finance america ’s vast fiscal and trade deficits , allowing americans to purchase more goods than they sell . but this amounts to a strange arrangement : a relatively poor country helps to finance america ’s ’s war on iraq , just as a massive tax cut for the richest country in the world ’s ’s ’s richest country , while enormous needs at home imply ample room for expansion of both consumption and investment . in fact , meeting the challenge of restructuring china ’s ’s economy away from exports and resource-intensive trade , china needs to stimulate consumption . while the rest of the world struggles to raise savings , china , with a saving rate at more than 40 % , is struggling to get its people to consume more . delivering improved social services ( public health care , training , and nation-wide retirement programs ) would diminish the need for a “ precautionary saving rate . ”
selling the five-rupee sachets shampoo toward poor consumers is regarded as clever marketing , but lending 5,000 rupees to a starving peasant at high interest rates is viewed as exploitative . both activities , after all , finance investors seek returns on their capital and motivated more by profit than compassion . but one is unambiguously less socially acceptable than another . high wages earned by cosmetics or soft-power manufacturer attracts no attention ; one pay to the ceo of a company that thrives on lending to the poor appears ill-considered , if not immoral . still , pmfis have succeeded in convening genuine need .
berkeley – advances in artificial intelligence and robotics are being powering a new wave of automation , with machinery matching or out-performing humans in a fast-moving range of tasks , including some requiring complex cognitive capabilities and advanced degrees . that process outpaced experts ’ expectations ; not surprisingly , its possible adverse impact on both quantity and quality of employment has aroused serious concern . listening to president donald trump ’s administration , one might think that trade remains the primary reason for job losses in the united states . trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s treasury secretary , steven mnuchin , has declared that a possible technology displacement by us workers would be impervious to [ the administration ’s ] radar screen . yet the consensus among economists shows that some 80 % losses in american manufacturing jobs over the last three decades were a product of labor-saving and productivity-enhancing technological change , with trade coming a distant second .
berkeley – back at the end of the 1980 ’s , japan ostensibly could do no wrong with the economists ’ eyes . they saw the bright edge in japan in terms of competitiveness relative to the north atlantic across a wide range of high-tech accuracy and mass-manufacturing industries that were producing tradable goods . they also saw an economy that , since reconstruction began after world war ii , had significantly outperforming europe ’s economies ’ expectations . and they saw an economy growing at a slower pace than the north atlantic economy had when it possessed the same level of absolute and relative economy-wide productivity levels . the safe bet in the late 1980 ’s seemed like that mechanization , computerization , and robotization would proceed .
amos oz , one of israel ’s best known writers , maintains that the contemporary palestinian-israeli war really amounts to two world wars : the “ unjust ” war against israel and the jews to establish a fundamentalist islamic state in an “ arab palestine ” and the palestinian people ’s “ only ” war for an independent state worthy of the name . conversely , israel is also fighting two wars : a mere war to defend its right to exist , accepted in its own integrity and security in the middle east , and an unjust and futile war to perpetuate its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and jewish-owned settlements . there are some 220,000 israeli settlers in the west bank and gaza , excluding roughly 190,000 people living in jerusalem neighborhoods that extend beyond the pre-1967 borders , divided jerusalem . despite the intifada , the number of settlers has decreased in only a handful of 144 settlements and more than 7,000 settlers in the gaza strip alone ; in 16 communities occupying 20 % of impoverished land already suffering one of the highest shia population densities in the world . israeli state support for expanding settlements is substantial .
markets ’ reaction has been to send spanish government bond rates even higher . contrary to some perceptions , europeans have remained inactive over the past year . but they have since lost touch with their touch . like aging magicians , they continue to experiment that used to impress , but that fails to deliver results – or , worse , prove counterproductive . meanwhile , financial fragmentation within the eurozone continues ; spain , and italy , to a lesser extent , suffers a seemingly irresistible rise in borrowing costs ; and political strains are growing more visible .
with asia riven by territorial disputes and historic tensions , maintaining a stable security balance will no easy task . but there are the levers of levers in place , which can help . in the 1990s , after american president bill clinton ’s administration contemplated how to respond to china ’s rising economic might , some urged a policy of containment . clinton rejected this advice : it would have been inconceivable that an anti-china alliance , given china ’s enduring desire to maintain good relations with the us ; more importantly , such a policy would ensure future hostility with china . instead , clinton chose a policy that could call to integrate and insure .
interests and identities shape dynamically how politicians produce dynamically as politicians produce for representation and citizens to react . trump , for example , no doubt succeeded in persuading some americans to view themselves as part of something akin to a white identity movement . but that identity – and how its adherents frame their own interests – could change yet again . the image of irresistible populist “ wave ” was always misleading . margaret thatcher did not bring about brexit all by itself .
they will make it easier for interactions across their network to spur the development of innovation ecosystems . the resulting opportunities to expand beyond traditional product and markets will enable pharmaceutical companies to evolve into companies that offer a range of health-care solutions . these will include not just prescription medicines , but also diagnostics , branded generics , and technologies that promote personalized medicine , as well as so-called “ neutraceuticals ” and other “ wellness options . while there is a limit on the size of many r & d organizations on such reforms , managing and maximizing the impact of this outside web of relationships will demand new skills and capabilities over and above those of excellent science . developing and rewarding employees who possess such skills will be an additional but welcome , challenge .
economics is not the kind of science in which there could ever be one true model that works best in all contexts . the point is not “ “ “ to reach a consensus about which model is right , ” as romer puts it , but to figure out which model applies best in a given setting . and doing that always remains an artisan , rather than a science , especially at a time when choices must be made in real time . the social world differs from the physical world , because it is man-made , and hence almost infinitely malleable . thus , unlike in the natural sciences , economics advances scientifically , not by replacing the old models with better ones , but by extending their own skill library , with every shedding light on different social fixes .
today , the auto sector accounts for just one-third of overall employment in china , compared to just one-half for india . india ’s structural transformation and sustainable growth bemoan its efforts to build a flexible labor market , centered on the easing of outdated and complicated jobs laws of jobs . the regulatory protections for workers in india ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s formal sector go beyond those of most developed countries , as well as to china , with mandated requirements rising as employees raise their rates . as jagdish bhagwati and arvind panagariya have pointed out , excessive labor-market regulations discourage indian entrepreneurs from employing unskilled workers and developing labor-intensive manufacturing , implying that india ’s government should redouble its reform efforts in this area . equally important , indian laborers – particularly the young people – need opportunities to upgrade their skills continuously .
the new politics explicitly encourages chinese firms to work with local firms in sectors like logistics , power , and information-based systems , thereby promoting interaction among the business , community , and government leaders . equally important , the policy also expands the availability of chinese financing , credits , and made insurance available to investors . taken together , this holistic approach represents something new for china . despite substantial political uncertainty in a wide range of countries in latin america , governments in the region seem keen to meet china ’s market-oriented reform efforts . brazil ’s government , for example , has been promoting an “ investment partnership ” program to coordinate investments in finance and transportation infrastructure industries .
ultimately , of course , gdp composition delivers a acid test for whether china succeeded . but the key word here , too , is “ ultimately . ” it is far too early to expect a major shift in major sources of aggregate demand . for now , the trends in potential determinants of chinese consumption are far more relevant . from this perspective , there is good reason for optimism , particularly given accelerated growth in china ’s ’s ’s services sector – one key building blocks of a consumer-led rebalancing .
to be sure , the us presidency grants trump substantial power to shape trade policies , so one can not ignore the possibility that he will pursue protectionist measures to appease his supporters . but , ultimately , there can be no broad-based support in america for a return to closed borders . europe , meanwhile , has been moving in the opposite direction . european multinationals have had large stakes in the chinese economy as well , with eu manufacturing exports to china and other emerging markets now nearly double america ’s . many europeans view trade as an opportunity , rather than a job threat ; and even europe ’s staunchest anti-globalizers shows little appetite for more protectionism .
at the time he was taking his job , manafort was indebted to the russian oligarch oleg deripaska , an aluminum tycoon close to president vladimir putin to the tune of $ 19 million . deripaska , who is subject to american sanctions , had previously maintained a $ 10 million annual contract with manafort . like other russian oligarchs , deripaska is unknown to deal gently with the people who displease him . after taking the job , manafort egged an ukraine-based worker , “ how should we use [ that ] to get whole ? ” manafort also offered to brief deripaska about what went wrong in the trump campaign .
kyiv – from blind-kyiv , i watched a successful revolutions in cairo and tunis with joy and admiration . egyptians and tunisians are right in pride in their desire to overthrow despotic governments . but , as someone who leads a peaceful revolution , i hope that pride is tempered by pragmatism , because regime change is only the first step in the establishment of a democracy backed by the rule of law . indeed , like my country , ukraine , now shows , following the revolutionary euphoria fades and the return of normality , democratic revolutions can be betrayed and reversed . ukraine ’s first ’s lessons for the egyptian and tunisian democrats are that elections do not make democracy possible .
increasingly , we are using our fingerprints , or our face to unlock our smartphones , pay for shopping , and boards airplanes . the protection against theft is obvious : what use is a telephone , a car , or a ticket that works only for its legitimate owner ? above all , biometrics can protect against the theft of our identity itself . that is the argument behind the world ’s largest biometrics project , a multimodal solution ( iris , fingerprints , and face ) affecting more than one billion indians . nouy nandan nilekani , the chairman infosys , who left his job to form the system , known as aadhaar , credits it with saving india ’s government roughly $ 9 billion by eliminating duplicitous and bogus identity in government beneficiary lists .
pittsburgh – nearly six months ago , at a moment of great alarm about the global financial and economic crisis , g-20 leaders met for an historic summit in london . their collective commitments to stimulate , regulate , and restructure global economic activity helped calm nerves around the globe . the many challenges that spurred the london summit remain true . anxiety levels may come down , in board rooms and on stock markets ; but the everyday drama for survival continues . indeed , anxiety levels may come down , in board rooms and stock markets ; but the dayton drama to continue ; for many people , it has deepened ; in villages and in the streets of the world ’s least-developed countries , particularly in africa . the united nations and the world bank predict that the direct and indirect effects of an economic meltdown will be felt in the developing world for a very long time to come .
were we observing the look of someone with an intimate knowledge of this catastrophes yet to come ? or was she just the most beautiful girl at a party meeting – the one avid adolescent had asked to france , then held on tightly ? now all over the centuries , the world is collectively writing a new novel . roth skillfully distilled the tragic and comic elements of that process , speaking out of forces that may be standing up to the dark tide of vulgarity and violence under trump . the first is the sovereign people who poured into the streets of every great town in a country with an understanding that , in terms of overall votes , is they , not trump , who won re-election .
perhaps simpson had a change of heart at his heart . perhaps he traveled his own road to damascus , come face-to-face with what he did and whom , repented , and sought to redress some of the damage to america and its long-run economic-growth prospects that he had caused . even in that case , however , naming those who wrongly behave with important positions of trust and acclaim them as bipartisan statesmen gives the next generation truly lousy incentives . and it ’s not as though us congressional republicans thought they owe enough to simpson for him to swing a single vote in either chamber of the legislature . obama officials reassured me that simpson had , indeed , had a change of heart ; that he was clever with a comforting understanding of issues ; that he might sway reporters and get them to describe the commission ’s counsel as “ bipartisan ” ( though he can not sway over actual legislators ) ; and that being genuine asset for the commission ’s substantive work .
what demographers call the global fertility rate is the global average number of people living births per woman above their lifetime . in the longer term , a population said to be stable if the tfr comes at a replacement rate that is slightly above 2.3 for the world as a whole and , somewhat lower , at 2.1 , for the developed world , reflecting its lower infant-mortality rate . the tfr for most advanced countries now stands well below replacement level . the oecd average stands at around 1.74 , but some countries , including germany and japan , are generating fewer than 1.4 children per woman . nevertheless , the largest tfr declines in recent years have occurred in developing countries .
by 2004 , there were more than one billion subscribers to gsm services globally . the global regulatory reach implied by enormous economies of scale in the manufacture of handsets and network hardware , so that prices fell fast , and interoperability between networks and across countries was much easier to achieve . many regulations play this standard-setting role . contrary to the simplistic view that regulation is inevitably bad for business , there are actually three important channels through which regulation can benefit an economy . one is market-creating and market-increasing role illustrated by the standard of gsm .
laguna beach – when i consider the outlook for the global economy and markets , i am engaged by the extent to which the world has collectively imposed an enormous bet on three fundamental outcomes : a shift toward materially higher and more inclusive global growth , policy avoidance , and prevention of market crashes . while all three outcomes are undoubtedly desirable , the unhappy reality is that they are far from certain – and heedless bets on them could prove exceedingly risky for current and future generations . the first component of the bet – a more inclusive global growth model – anticipates continued economic recovery in the united states , with a 3 % growth rate bolstered by robust wage growth . it also presupposes that china ’s annual gdp growth rate will stabilize at 6.5-7 % , thereby enabling the risks posed by pockets of excessive leverage in the shadow-banking system to be defused gradually , even as the economy ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s growth engines continue to shift from exports and public capital to domestic consumption and private investment . another , more uncertain assumption underpinning a bet on more inclusive growth is that the eurozone and japan will get away from the mire low growth and avoid deflation that by ignoring households and companies ’ ability to postpone purchasing choices would undermine already weak economic performance .
clinton ’s popularity ratings rose after the impeachment proceedings ended . most americans believed that impeachment was a mistake . many feared that the impeachment of hillary clinton would damage the presidency ; but its primary effect on presidential power was just the opposite . republicans ended up agreeing to the democrats that accountable to the debacle lay with kenneth startups , an independent attorney whose investigation of clinton ’s real-estate dealings years earlier ultimately led him to lewinsky . both parties allowed an independent attorney ’s statute to lapse , freeing the presidency from a mighty form of oversight , much to trump ’s advantage over a generation later .
most recently , in may 2015 , large numbers of traditional labour voters were deserted their party to vote for the uk independence party ( ukip ) , at the forefront of the brexit campaign . to be sure , establishment leaders had long sought to save greece by ramping up criticism from the eu , accusing it of demanding that national governments pursue unpopular or failed policies . but that only laid the ideas for alternative policies out of reach , while stoking eu voters directly and from opposing the eu itself . although establishment parties have criticized the eu , for the most part they have not lost sight of the benefits of eu membership . indeed , in the uk ’s brexit referendum , both major parties backed the eu ’s “ remain ” campaign , although they have been split internally .
and other emerging economies are not likely to pick up the slack . brazil , touted in 2010 as an “ emerging-market aid player , ” now finds itself in an economic and political crisis as it is south africa . these challenges are being compounded by new financial regulations in advanced countries , hampering flows of investment and finance to the developing world . the weakening developing-economy incomes further reflects a slowdown in global demand and the crash of commodities , which , as nobel laureate angus deaton showed , have been catastrophic for much of the developing world . to cap it all off , expansionary monetary policies adopted by major economies are fueling instability .
pakistan has a major nuclear-weapons weapons program and faces an expansionist jihad insurgency that previously attacked military outposts suspected of storing nuclear assets . though pakistan has not experienced a nuclear breach , and the government insists that safeguards remain robust , the country ’s ’s ’s increasingly frequent and severe bouts of instability raise significant questions for the future . whereas north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear arsenal is much smaller , persistent doubts about the regime ’s sustainability makes its grave concern . in the event of a regime ’s collapse – a distinct possibility – it would be hard to avoid the diversion of its assets or even the use of its weapons . for its part , iran seems relatively stable , at least compared to its neighbors .
but this was not a us-iran deal ; it was brokered by six leading powers and endorsed by the un . those powers should make it clear that they will not re-impose sanctions , and that any us attempt to impose its will through extraterritorial measures – say , using access to the us-clearing dollar as a foreign-policy tool – would countered by coordinated action . for the uk , in particular , this may require a willingness to disagree head-on with america ’s foreign policy , in a manner that some devotees of the us “ special relationship ” will find an uncomfortable approach . as for climate change , the election of one who purport to believe that global warming is a “ chinese hoax ” created to harm american business is an obvious bad news . but the global momentum to tackle climate change can and must be sustained .
ironically , under a pessimistic scenario , iran ’s ’s new government , controlled by conservatives and hard-liners , actually fits the region better than it currently is . after all , saudi arabia , egypt , and many other arab states , too , are ruled by authoritarian hardliners with little interest in de-escalation of regional conflicts . this would force a reform-oriented resurgence in iran exceedingly difficult . the most likely scenario , of course , is a combination of both dynamics . but , given that it is in everyone ’s interest to ensure that developments hew more closely at a reform-oriented path should be obvious to all that a diplomatic work with regard to iran is far from complete .
in the aftermath of the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 , italy ’s then-finance minister giulio tremonti famously endorsed the health of the country ’s ’s ’s banking system . as a result , a major recapitalization of italian banks , together with the creation of a “ bad bank ” to absorb npls , was seen as pointless . ten years later , italy no longer envisioned the land of prosperous banks and happy savers . protracted recession and economic malaise dented the individual savings rate , while banks no longer held the resources to provide tranquility for many retail investors whose trust was severely impaired . an implicit pact between banks and savers broke at the end of 2015 , when four troubled local banks bailed out and shareholders took the hit .
many poles are wary of the church ’s equivocal attitude towards democracy and are allergic to its aggressive presence in politics . it is a sorry paradox , indeed , that for many ex-communist , in opposing the church pose as defenders of the liberal democratic values that they once persecuted by an unremitting zeal . kwasniewski 's strategy of seduction appealed to huge numbers of the young and the middle class , but most of all to peasants , the unemployed , those left behind by poland ’s rising economy . so the man who spoke much about the future riding in power saddled with votes of the past . that link would dog kwasniewski 's presidency .
a consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders , but the obstacles remain . perhaps the main risk is that “ aid bureaucracies ” now travel over one another to try to get their hands on an $ 20 billion so much to take a lot by meetings , expert consultations , overheads , messages , and more meetings . “ donor partnerships ” can become an expensive end in itself , merely delaying genuine action . if donor governments really want results , they should take the money out of the hand of 30 or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it at one or two sites , the most logic being the world bank in washington and the international agricultural development fund ( ifad ) in rome . one or both of these un agencies would then hold multi-billion dollar bills .
after all , the brics economies are probably the single most important source of future global growth . they represent more than one-quarter of earth ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s landmass , more than 41 % of its population , nearly 25 % of world gdp , and almost half of all foreign-exchange and gold reserves . indeed , the brics might also be dubbed the r-5 mark of 5 , after their ’ members ’ currencies – the real , the ruble , the rupee , the renminbi , and rand . at the new delhi summit , brics leaders will discuss creating joint institutions , particularly a joint development bank that can help to mobilize savings among countries . currently , the brics countries represent a loose , informal bloc .
on the other hand , he needs to change conversations in order to reassure voters that their economic-growth future is bright . as it stands , britons , like their european counterparts elsewhere , feel overtaxed for spoil public services , and are angry that their incomes have dipped over the past five years . as a result , many resent welfare recipients and fear competition for jobs – a sentiment that is fueling the populist rise , anti-eu , and anti-immigrant parties across europe . a key difference in the uk is that ukip ’s gains ground with voters despite rapid economic growth ( more than 3 % annually , the eu ’s highest rates ) . between now and may , cameron must persuade voters that the british economy will continue to perform strongly , fueling rising real incomes .
it is subject to what milton friedman called “ “ “ long and variable ” lags . thus , policies aimed at boosting employment by the end of , say , the calendar year required to put it in place about a year ago to have the time to have reached their full impact . some countries – china , for example , did , in fact , implement such job-creation policies a year ago , and already see the benefits . others , like the united states , did not , and so unemployment remains at around 10 % . this is not to say that the obama administration has made no effort to boost employment .
sectors with higher levels of human capital – such as electronic consumer goods – have far higher r & d costs than the shoe , so that manufacturing such goods on an assembly line in a low-cost country is probably not extremely costly when compared to r & d and other intangible costs . for more advanced goods , the eu added value ( where the intangible parts of the manufacturing process are occurring in europe ) is quite high . imposing trade defenses against such goods , even if legally warranted , is likely to create problems for globalized european companies . many argue that these problems are the price to pay for keeping companies engaged in anti-competitive behavior or to receive trade-distorting subsidies . but , even if steps worked , the eu has probably not tilted against anti-competitive business-defense practices .
motivating corporations to do the right thing is even harder to do . after all , corporations have no conscience ; it is merely the conscience of those running the corporation ; and , as america ’s recent corporate scandals make all too clear , conscience often takes a back seat to profit . america ’s legal system ensures that firms that produce a faulty , and particularly unsafe product hold liable for the consequences . firms operate in a much better position than consumers to evaluate the safety of their product ; we all benefit from the fact that our legal system has given corporations incentives to pay attention to the safety of what they produce . similarly , environmental laws make firms liable for their toxic wastes , and many countries , including the american one , have enshrined the principle that “ polluters pay , ” that is , companies must pay for the damage they cause .
we need not look far for such a mission . the case for acting on a massive scale to combat climate change has been made in europe and even in china . why , then , have such little debate erupted in the us ? is it because those who oppose such debates reject the science of climate change ? or do they deny the science , for accepting it would legitimize an economically significant national activist ?
once again , iran ’s voters are poised to vote yes or no for the nice treaty . forgotten , what the treaty is all about ? well , it is one of those all-too-frequent late-night compromises reached by eu heads of state and government that seeks to slither around and through some practical difficulties , while postponing others . the compromise reached at nice four years ago matters because it includes all the technicalities of voting balances , and the sharing of power among eu institutions that must remain firmly where the union can admit new members . enlargement is the most important item on the european agenda , and the nice treaty is its cornerstone .
with the proverbial benefit ( and embarrassment ! ) in hindsight , it is clear that the patterns of growth that emerged over the past half-century were little understood and rarely ( if ever ) predicted by economists . at the very moment of the 1960s , when asia ’s tiger economies were starting to take off , for example , nobel laureate gunnar myrdal , wrote his asian drama to diagnose the causes of asian poverty and explain why its poverty appeared ineradicable . simultaneous to this , a strong consensus developed among economists and policymakers that favored import substitution policies then pursued by countries including india , argentina , brazil , egypt , egypt , and turkey . after beggaring their adherents , those policies are now thoroughly discredited . the crucial point here is not just that economists got so much wrong , but that almost nobody received things right .
but wade postponed legislative elections , originally scheduled for june 2006 , first to february 2007 , and later by a presidential decree later this month , to june 2007 . two weeks ago , there were almost daily debates about the possibility that the presidential election will be delayed indefinitely . now that a presidential election will take hold , but is it fairly fair . one month before the election , only 64 % of citizens who had registered had received their voting cards . on january 28 , a calm but “ unauthorized ” demonstration by opposition parties brutally rebuked the police and the three presidential candidates , respectively .
princeton , lej – the intersection of genetics and intelligence constitutes an intellectual minefield . harvard ’s former president larry summers touched off one explosion in 2005 , when he tentatively implied a genetic explanation for the difficulty that his university has had in recruiting female professors in math and physics . ( he did not propose that men are on average more talented in these fields than women , but that there is some reason to believe that men are more likely than women to be found at both the upper and lower end of the skill spectrum in these fields – and harvard , of course , only appoints people at the extremes of the upper end . ) now one of our top scientists of our time has blundered far more clumsily in the same minefield , with predictable results . in october , james watson , who shared the 1962 nobel prize for describing the structure of dna , was in london to support its memoir , avoided confounding humans and other lessons from the life of science .
china ’s current president , xi jinping , visited zimbabwe in 2015 . state visits to the other direction were more unevenly distributed . mugabe ’s first visit to china came in 1980 , just six months after independence ; made 13 more during his tenure ; and high-level visits by other zimbabwean officials were even more frequent , occurring roughly once every two years during mugabe ’s rule . kenyan presidents , on the other hand , traveled to china just six times during the same period , most recently in may 2017 . zimbabwe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders made the most of their visits to free trade and military cooperation , and probably engaged directly with private chinese companies .
geneva – the world ’s refugee crisis is most often measured in numbers . but for young refugees to miss out on an education , the crisis can also be tracked by an irreversible metric : passage of time . of the 17.2 million people that the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( the un refugee agency ) has a responsibility to protect , roughly half come under age of 18 , which means that an entire generation of young people , already rob them of their childbearing , could lose out just as well . school-age children form a high share of the world ’s displaced population . in the late 2016 fiscal year , an estimated 11.6 million refugees experiencing “ protracted displacement ” ” have been detected : they have been cut off from their homes for more than five years , and have no imminent chance ” ” to recover .
but how serious are these policy-makers ’ political crimes to whom greenspan now pleads guilty ? in my opinion , they are misdemeanors . against them , you need to set what former us treasury secretary larry summers calls for greenspan ’s ’s ’s ’s “ golden glove ” performance at the avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years at the fed . “ “ “ felonies ” of which greenspan stands accused are further two charges : that he should have done more to stop the stock-market bubble of the late 1990 ’s , and that he should have done more to stave off the us housing bubble of the early 2000 ’s . here , greenspan holds his ground and pleads no blame .
and it is better to know that history , provided that we would like to avoid repeating its ugliest scenes . the truth is that the bds ’ movement is anything more than a sinister caricature of anti-totalitarian and anti-apartheid struggles . it is a campaign whose instigators have no purpose other than to discriminate against , de-legitimizing , and vilify israel , which in their mind never stopped wearing its own yellow star . to good faith activists perhaps assumed in duplicitous representations of the movement , i would say only that there are too many noble causes in need of assistance to let oneself enlisted in dubious terms . those worthy causes include fighting the jihadist decapitators , rescuing women and girls enslaved by boko haram ; defending the middle east ’s ’s ’s imperiled christians and arab democrats ; and , of course , striving for a just peace between israelis and palestinians .
it cuts genetics too soon , however , because the science of “ epigenetics ” – studying mechanisms for turning genes on and off , thereby altering the way cells develops without altering the genetic code – is gaining traction . indeed , the 2012 nobel prize in medicine was awarded to john gurdon and the shinya yamanaka for revolutionizing scientists ’ understanding of how cells develop through the reprogramming dna and cells without disrupting their genetic structure . in 1962 , gurdon ’s discovery that almost any cell in the body contains the full code of dna , enabled it to create a tadpole via adult cloning . more than four decades later , in 2006 , yamanaka discovered a way to trick complex adult cells in mice to regressing to their immature state , forming stem cells . prior to this , stem cells – which can potentially be reprogrammed to evolve into replacements for lost or damaged tissue – could take only from early-stage embryos , a practice that fueled ethical controversy .
claims could be prioritized and processed regularly , with refugees able to arrive in europe sound and prepared to work or study . the crisis in the mediterranean can not be managed piecemeal . the financial costs of patrolling its waters and modernizing those adrift are exorbitant . loss of lives is inexcusable . but we need not wait until the root causes of displacement – state failure and civil war – are addressed .
by the most up-to-date estimate by the late economic historian angus maddison , china ’s per capita gdp stood at an annual rate of $ 6,725 in the 1990 ’s , accounting for 21 % of per capita gdp in the united states . that is roughly the same gap that existed between america and japan in 1951 , singapore in 1967 , taiwan in 1975 , and south korea in 1977 , the four economies that also rank among the 13 successful economies studied by the us growth commission . harnessing their latecomer ’s advantage , japan ’s at an average annual growth rate soared to 9.2 % over the subsequent 20 years , compared to 8.6 % in singapore , 8.3 % in taiwan , and the 7.6 % in south korea . if the latecomer ’s advantage implied by the income gap between four world nies and america allowed the nies to realize annual gdp growth rates of 7.6 % for 20 years , china ’s annual growth potential should equal 8 % for the 2008-2028 period . to realize its potential growth as a latecomer , china needs , first and foremost to deepen its market-oriented reforms , address diverse structural challenges , and develop its economy according to its comparative advantage .
the signatories agreed to conflate biological diversity through saving species and habitats , and using biological resources ( such as forests ) sustainably . in 2002 , the treaty ’s signatories went further , committing themselves to pledging “ to reduce the present rate of biodiversity ” ” ” ” ” ” by 2010 . unfortunately , like so many other international agreements , the un convention on biological diversity remains fundamentally unknowable , un-championed , and unfulfilled . that neglect is a human tragedy , and it is here that can be no one . for an extremely low cash-outlay – and perhaps none at all on the balance – – we could settle nature and thus protect the very foundation of our own lives and livelihoods .
it is because netanyahu is driven by an almost messianic determination to stop iran from acquiring the means to destroy israel , that he might be amenable to a fundamental change of its attitude toward palestine , provided obama makes visible headway in his drive to halt iran ’s nuclear program . in netanyahu ’s ’s own view , solving the palestinian problem would not remove the iranian challenge ; rather , it is the neutralization of that existential threat , paving the way for the eventual establishment of a palestinian state . netanyahu also knows that the arab side ’s failure so far has nurtured radical zionism . like john kerry , the chair of the american senate ’s foreign affairs committee , put it , “ “ “ this peace process is not a one path street ” in which the onus entirely on israel . it remains to be seen whether an abysmally dysfunctional arab world and powerful non-state operatives in its midst , like hamas and hezbollah , will react in ways obama expects .
just as imemo economists had predicted , most ( 66 % ) of those who responded that question in moscow thought it was unfair . but there was a surprise here : new york yielded practically identical results ( 68 % thought it was unfair ) . so we decided last year to see whether the same similarity between moscow and new york persists today , or whether , given the revival of authoritarianism in russia today , attitudes toward markets became more negative . we administered a identical questionnaire at both cities in 2015 . we presented the results at the american economic association ’s annual meeting this january .
like a dysfunctional family , the northern “ advanced ” countries ponder whether or not to bail out the south “ emerging-market ” “ emerging-market ” economies . ” the prognoses for each case are starkly different . in a former version , interest rates converge and default risk nil , because , with the ecb backsliding on its members ’ liabilities , as the us federal reserve does in the american case , the euro becomes “ “ “ “ local-currency ” ” ” ” ” ” . and how often do we hear talk of sovereign restructurings of local-currency debt ? in the latter version of the eurozone , there is differential credit risk , and eventually bank run , de-euroization , and defaults : the common currency at odds with the needs of member states .
accordingly , republicans have a fair chance of creating a conservative majority on the nine-member supreme court that may last for decades , particularly if they win the presidency again in 2020 . that majority may erode democratic checks , such as campaign-finance limits , which dealt a devastating blow by the 2010 citizens united decision . in a 5-4 majority , the court ruled that corporations are “ associations of individuals , ” ” and therefore could spend on political campaign contributions , as a result , violating their first amendment right to freedom of expression . likewise , republican obstructionism in the senate has placed other levels of the federal judiciary at risk . during president barack obama ’s second term in office , rates at which vacancies in the american district and circuit courts were filled down to their lowest point in 50 years .
calderon ’s forward challenge will not be easy . lopez obrador and his supporters may be expected to work relentlessly to thwart his plans . but they are unlikely to derail his administration . the underlying stability highlighted by mexico ’s post-election crisis is also apparent elsewhere in latin america . whatever the potential for a leftward shift this year in some latin american countries , others , including mexico , chile , and brazil , are clearly less vulnerable to the type of populist rule we have ’ve seen in venezuela and bolivia .
there is still time to react – by demonstrating strong leadership and prioritizing growth over shortsighted policies – but for the time being limited , and the clock steps backward . next year will prove crucial because it marks the end of the current political cycle and the beginning of a new one . a new german government will emerge from the end of the year , the european parliament election , and , by the end of the year , a new european commission . it is here that political leaders should dedicate to its efforts . nobody wants the eu to fail , owing to its citizens ’ disaffection .
colombo , as china ’s economy slowing and growth in the developed world remains anemic , governments across asia are working to keep their economies on an upward trajectory . in sri lanka , where i am prime minister , the challenge is to find ways to accelerate our already steady economic growth . one thing is clear : we can not expect the rest of the world to welcome our economic aspirations the manner in which it once opened its arms to china ’s ’s ’s ’s rapid rise as an economic powerhouse or – in earlier decades – cheered on japan ’s growth and the so-called asian tigers , including south korea . today , we asians are witnessing , on an all-day basis , waging fierce political assaults on the tools and policies that helped lift hundreds of millions of our citizens out of poverty . indeed , this year , free trade appears to be the scapegoat of choice among global ’s newfound populists and demagogues .
here , too , is where sunni-shiite collaboration has come in . widely ignored , iraqi sunni and shia centralists have managed over the past few months to form a united parliamentary platform that leaves sectarian tensions behind . more than 100 adherents of ayad allawi , al sadr , and others have joined their ranks . this supra-sectarian platform invites a central-government administration of iraqi ’s ’s ’s ’s natural resources , as well as postponing a looming referendum to broach the city of kirkuk . likewise , change within the us government is noteworthy .
political fervor , it seems , did not die in rousseau in rousseau and " danton . " so the truth must lie elsewhere : the french are not hopeless with politics ; they simply await a genuine leader . as matters stand , a case can be made that the french will never come to believe that the state lacks power , globalization , or no globalization . the french still expect greater things from their governments than from an integrated europe or a boundless world . yes , the french are incorrigible lovers of the welfare state .
london – next week , governments will gather in warsaw , poland , for a pivotal round of climate negotiations , with both expectations and ambitions managing themselves at an all-time low . but this need not be like this : warsaw meeting provides an opportunity to galvanize action on one of the most potent forces driving climate change , the trillions of dollars spent by governments on fossil-fuel subsidies . the warsaw meeting is a staging post on a path to the 2015 united nations climate summit in paris , at which governments will seek to forge an agreement that is impeding dangerous climate change , defined as the global warming of more than two degrees fahrenheit . failure would expose future generations to catastrophic climate risks , while renting out millions of people in poverty caused by increasingly frequent , intense , and protracted droughts , floods , and storms . basic carbon arithmetic illustrates the scale of the problem .
in a march 2015 letter to the g-20 , a group of scientists , environmentalists , and opinion leaders warned that ramping up investment in megaprojects irreversible and catastrophic environmental damage . “ every year , we are already consuming about one-and-a-half-planets ’ worth of resources , ” the authors explained . “ infrastructure choices ” need to be made to ease , rather than make matters worse . similarly , the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( gms ) , both that “ infrastructure developments ” and long-lived products locking societies into greenhouse-intensive emissions pathways , can be both hard or extremely costly to change . and , indeed , the g20 has placed few social , environmental , or climate-related criteria on the “ wish ” ” ” list of mega-projects that each member country will file to its summit in turkey in november .
for example , the fed committed to keep the interest rate low , at least until the unemployment rate fell to 6.5 % – a move that arguably lower long-term borrowing costs . likewise , mark carney , in his first policy actions as governor of the bank of england , announced forward guidance for short-term interest rates . while the effect of such interest-rate guidance on the economy can not be determined without additional data , there are plenty of arguments in its favor . perhaps the most telling recent example of the central bank , using forward guidance effectively , was european central bank president mario draghi ’s ’s july 2012 announcement that the ecb would do “ whatever it takes ” to ensure the euro ’s survival . that pledge alone stabilized borrowing costs and dramatically reduce interest-rate spreads for struggling eurozone countries .
indeed , just the opposite response is likely to – – efforts to tighten sanctions still further . still , just as the us adopted a “ “ “ bomb ” and conversation ” approach with the serbs during the bosnian war ’s dénouement , america must be willing to “ sanctions and speak ” when it comes to iran , thereby creating more room for an eventual us diplomatic strategy . first , the us should consider establishing diplomacy with iran and placing diplomats on the ground . this would not be an easy process , and could well meet considerable iranian resistance . yet iranians have diplomatic relationships with other members of its major interlocutor in talks over its nuclear program ; the sanctions-minded p-5 +1 group ( china , france , germany , russia , the united kingdom , and the us ) ; and restoration iran-us diplomatic ties would shorten lines of communication and close the 4444-day chapter in 1979-1981 .
anyone watching the ipl , however , may be tempted to conclude that twenty20 cricket , the “ instant ” form of play , is , in fact , an american game intentionally rediscovered by indians . other countries followed suit , with tournaments modeled on the ipl springing up throughout a cricketing world . to keen observers , the ipl represented more than a sports league ; it signaled nothing less than the emergence of a new india . in the ipl ’s glitz , glamour , and excess lay an antidote to the hidebound statist mentality that produced economic stagnation in india in recent years . here was a venture that opened new vistas for businesses and fired the imaginations of young people to emulate entrepreneurial energies showing by owners , promoters , players , and fans .
this superficiality results from the observation that , although communism was an comprehensively “ modern ” notion , modernity in romania goes only a skin deep . at its 20th century ’s close , romania ( like bulgaria , russia , ukraine , and other heavily sovietized societies ) looks more like a “ neo-feudal ” state than a modern society . for here , there is a state in which groups , classes , even individuals struggle for the privileges accorded , not by talent and labor , but rather by the status of one part in which one belongs . state banks , legally authorized public societies ( by commerce unions , for example ) , act little differently in romania today than feudal guilds behaved in medieval europe . at a whim in a state , for example , they can be exonerated from pay taxes , or have their posts and operate unchallengeable through law .
on the other side are diplomacy possible to free up the israeli soldier and place a stop to fire qassam rockets from gaza into israel – a daily occurrence that has challenged the credibility of the new israeli government under prime minister ehud olmert . but the crucial problem is that , up to every historical juncture now , the palestinians have refused to accept a compromise and consequently incapable of nation-building . back in 1947 , they refused the un partition plan , which called for the establishments of two states in british palestine . in 1993 , following the oslo agreements , the palestinian authority established under yasir arafat became yet another militarized authoritarian regime , very much like syria and egypt , and done nothing to alleviate palestinian refugees ’ suffering . it was this failure that brought hamas into power .
in asia , indonesia may look “ “ europe ” in its obama craze , but essentially represents an anomaly , easily explainable by obama ’s brief indonesian upbringing . otherwise , and for very different reasons , a near-majority of asian elites await the rising possibility of obama ’s victories with some bewilderment and even apprehension . japanese elites , for example , tend to favor continuity over change . in their thinking , the hard power of the united states matters more than its soft power , and their vision of an america “ “ tied to the leader ” to lead ” is largely unchanged . for them , the us stands above all the strategic counterweight needed to counterbalance china .
canberra – last year , north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s kim jong-un and us president donald trump hurling kindergarten insults over one another ’s : rocket man hers hounded trump of kim ; “ the mentally deranged us dotard , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” kim retorted – while threatening to cut east asia in a post-atomic rush . now , in an astonishing and dramatic development , the two may be meeting . kim reportedly is willing to denuclearize and eager to engage directly with trump , who has agreed . but optimism about this turn of events must be tempered by cautious realism . north korea , for its part , is a nuclear issue from hell .
nepad , a new partnership for africa ’s development , an organization dedicated to promoting decent and reasonable norms of economic and political development across the continent , has been at the heart of such a policy . despite his domestic troubles and the loss of the global visibility that accompanied mandela ’s retirement age , south africa remains perceived as an emerging power comparable in its status and aspiration to say , brazil , india , and nigeria . such powers seek an effective , constructive regional role , and perhaps , in some instances , worldwide . they tend to have proactive and assertive foreign policies and aspire to more than middle-power status and limited niche-style influence enjoyed by canada , sweden , or saudi arabia . south africa seeks a broader , more influential role , strengthened by its bright standing as a regional hegemon .
it aspires to join the european union , bringing the eu into our three borders , even as the us , too , has sought to join one day . indeed , turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker . immediately after the collapse of the soviet union , turkey proposed the black sea economic cooperation . earlier this year , after the american-led effort to mediate the middle east peace settlement began to falter , turkey carried out the mediator ’s job in both the israeli-palestinian conflict and the conflict between syria and israel . now , in the immediate wake of the russia-georgia crisis , turkey ’s leaders have stepped forward once again to assume a leadership role in the caucasus .
indeed , throughout the region , apprehension is growing that once foreign troops leave , afghanistan will again descend into a civil war , ultimately bringing the taliban back into power . this is why “ bringing troops home early ” troops into force has become the prime goal for western policymakers engaged in the region . the west needs to get out before bloodletting start again in earnest . my fears are that the us has not seen the last either al qaeda or the taliban . like a neighboring country , india would face troubling implications if it returned to power in afghanistan , because would iran , which would not sit idly by as long as sectarian strife intensified , and the shia have become targets of a resurgent taliban .
and governments need to respond to banks ’ threats , by declaring a willingness to allow insolvent banks to be judged accordingly . a market economy needs to rest on the economic principle of profit and loss . an economy with neither bankruptcies nor the rule of law that applies just to all of them is no market economy . a law that applies to all other companies should apply to banks just as well . moreover , governments should guarantee insolvent banks ’ loans to nonfinancial companies , just as private-sector customers present , fixed-term , and savings deposits by reforming insolvent laws .
but gross capital inflows are from emerging-market to emerging-market equities , through large banks now quite implicitly backed by sovereign bonds in the us and europe . from the perspective of international investors , too-big-to-fail banks are the perfect places to park their reserves – just as long as the sovereign in question remains solvent . but what will those banks do with the money ? when a similar emerged in the 1970 ’s , the so-called “ recycling of oil surpluses ” – banks in western financial centers – extended credit to latin america , the communist poland , and the communist party of romania . that was not a good idea , because it led to massive ( for now ) a debt crisis of 1982 .
when given how to deliver , disease , despair , and death rush in . but the transition ’s plagues lie more than a health crisis ; they signify a deeper malaise . so , put aside the fact that these illnesses are contagious and could all too easily spread , or the notion that the fortunate bear some moral responsibility for the welfare of the poor and the sick , and merely consider the economic effects of transition plagues . the world bank cites aids “ the first threat to african development . ” companies in south africa stagger from losing so many workers to aids .
but , while it would be a strategic mistake for erdoğan to enter putin ’s orbit , plenty of leaders have made strategic mistakes before they do . this is why the coming months , when turkey and the eu bite out of contentious issues , are so critical . erdoğan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s post-coup crackdown is far from the only source of tension between turkey and the west , particularly the eu . turkey is insisting that visa-free travel for turkish citizens visiting the eu , promised by eu governments in january , should be delivered this year . but , with turkey so far having failed to meet the agreed terms , including overhauling its anti-terrorist legislation , that may not happen – an outcome made even more likely by a coup attempt .
as long as the palestinians are oppressed and denied the nation-state , conflict will arise . nevertheless , over the last 13 years , netanyahu has enthusiastically supported the expansion of jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem . as it well knows , settlements amount to a physical roadblock stand in the way of a contiguous , an independent palestinian state . moreover , during his recent electoral campaign , netanyahu has pledged that , if re-elected , he would bar the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank through “ “ control of the whole region ” . at his word , we should take him .
it failed to stop the money supply from contracting in the early stages of the great depression . heedless of its accountability as an emergency lender of last resort allowed the banking system to collapse . when financial stability hanging in the balance of 1933 , reserve banks ’ failure to cooperate obstructed effective action . given such incompetence , it should not be surprising that successive reforms were far-reaching . but such reforms have gone in precisely the opposite direction from today ’s proposed changes : fewer constraints on policymakers ’ discretionary power , more power to the board , and a greater role for the new york fed , all to permit the us federal reserve system to react more rapidly and robustly in a depression .
pittsburgh – the wall street journal recently ran a front-page article reporting that the monetary-policy “ doves , ” who forecast low inflation in the united states , got the better of deficit hawks , who argued that the fed ’s monthly purchases of long-term securities or so-called quantitative easing ( qe ) would unleash faster price growth . the report was correct but misleading because it failed to mention why so little inflation exists today . were the doves right , or just lucky ? the american federal reserve board pumped up trillions of dollars of reserves , but never had so many reserves generated so little monetary growth . neither the hawks nor the doves ( nor anyone else ) expected .
by reducing rates of unwanted pregnancies , family planning also decreases the death rate from unsafe abortions . this does not do only good for mothers ; it does not do it . lowering high-risk pregnancies , curbing unwanted pregnancies , and mutualizing births have shown a reduction in newborn and child death rates . the guttmacher institute estimates that fully meeting women ’s need for contraception would prevent 600,000 newborn deaths and 500,000 child deaths annually . moreover , cutting the birth rate that is extremely high in many lmics would help to reduce the strain on these countries ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ health-care systems by diminishing maternal and newborn care and immunization costs .
the saudis , too , are recoiling under the barrage of criticism from their wahhabi brand of islam , commonly blamed for incubating extremism and inspiring terrorism . meanwhile , saudi arabia ’s human-rights record – including withholding elementary rights for women – is coming under continuous scrutiny . against this backdrop , the kingdom is taking the fight against its enemies . king salman bin abdulaziz al saud is the country ’s above-the-fray ruler , but its son , crown prince mohammad bin salman al saud , currently wields much power . as defense minister , mohammad has pursued the saudi policy of backing anti-assad rebels in syria in concert with turkey , unleashing a war on pro-iranian tribesmen in yemen ( at immense humanitarian costs ) .
the answer to the first question is both yes and no . the us has failed to eliminate the taliban from afghanistan , and entirely exclude the possibility of the country once again becoming a terrorist haven . the ongoing peace talks with the taliban , as well as the impending reduction of america ’s military presence in the country , provide a clear acknowledgement of this . the american public is war-weary , and us president donald trump seems keen on declaring an end to the longest international conflict in american history before the 2020 us presidential election . at the same time , america has achieved many of its early core goals .
emerging-market officials will earn accreditation by demonstrating a capacity for them to apply practically . the ebrd seeks to encourage the training of critical mass of experts from ten countries in our region , convinced that the certification could become just as respected as those held by a chartered financial analyst or member of a project-management institute member . just five months ago , in london , the us hosted the “ “ “ ppp days ” conference with the backing of other multilateral institutions , the g20 , and the un . we had plenty of experts – some 300 from both the public and private sectors of 30 countries – who sought to provide an answer to a simple question : “ what would it take to double private-sector investment in emerging markets ? ” one useful tool in the effort is blended , a benchmarking index created by the economist intelligence task force that assesses the capacity of emerging-market countries across the asia-pacific region , latin america , african , eastern europe , and former soviet republics in the commonwealth of independent states to deliver sustainable ppps .
america ’s efforts , led by united nations special envoy george mitchell , have made clear that the current ruling coalition in israel is incapable of doing the minimum necessary for peace . the obama administration has staked its reputation on getting the israelis and palestinians to agree , at least on their security and frontiers . the results , at best , are mixed . palestinians have complied with all israeli and international security requirements , while binyamin netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s government , which gives lip-service to the two-state solution , has yet to elucidate which israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s borders will be . meanwhile , israeli governments want to continue to build settlements in the occupied territories , as part of international law and a minimal peace requirements detailed in the “ quartet roadmap ” ( the american one , the un , the european union , and russia ) .
then the contagion sets in , as increasingly risk-averse investors , particularly short-term developed-country investors , begin withdrawing funds from other countries to cover the losses they incurred in the economies in which crises hit . with that , crises spill across borders , affecting entire regions , or even the whole class of emerging economies . that is what happened in latin america in the 1980s , when mexico ’s moratorium on external-debt servicing in august 1982 sparked a dysfunctional debt crisis . the same thing occurred in east asia in the 1990s : the crisis started in thailand in july 1997 with the collapse of the baht and quickly spreading to other east asian countries . it became a broad-based emerging-economy crisis in august 1998 , after russia imposed a moratorium on commercial banks ’ payments to foreign lenders .
as a result , prominent economists , including senior staff officers at the international monetary fund , have become increasingly critical of oda in recent years , arguing for failure to contribute to economic growth . but un research shows that if blatantly driven away from consideration , evidence points to a robust positive relationship . unfortunately , despite recent efforts to enhance aid effectiveness , progress has been modest at best , not least because average funding for projects fell by more than two-thirds . debt is another side of the evolving dilemma . over the past decade , the joint imf-world bank heavily indebted poor countries initiative and france , a complementary multilateral initiative for debt relief , have made significant progress on debt sustainability .
denver – for many foreign audiences , the united states , ’ primary election for the 2012 presidential vote – which , alas , continues to rage against summers – must be a terrifying display of what america and its leaders know little about foreign policy . post-election debate after debate reveals the reality that neither candidate attempts to challenge president barack obama is especially keen on the details of any of america ’s ’s ’s ’s relationships around the globe , not to mention crises that dot the international landscape , particularly those not involved in us troops . indeed , ignorance appears to be a force for candidates still . when jon huntsman , an early contender , displayed some real intellectual heft by making some useful points on handling china , punctuated by his own mastery of mandarin , some other candidates responded with derision . to have even known a “ china perspective ” appears disqualifying for a huntsman who soon ended his candidacy .
i helped launch the first safe schools initiative , following boko haram ’s kidnapping of the 276 schoolgirls in chibok , nigeria last april . so far , a fund has mobilized an estimated $ 30 million from businesses , nigerian governments , and international donors , and a multi-donor trust fund was established at the un . nigeria ’s ’s ’s ’s initiative focuses on school and community interventions , with special measures for the most at-risk and vulnerable children . the agenda includes constructing better school fortifications , connecting schools to police stations by cellular telecommunications , and creating community security groups – consisting of teachers , parents , police , community leaders , and young people themselves – to support safe zones for education . the first set of schools now received funding , and the first-ever cohort of at-risk girls has been relocating to government schools in safer country regions .
luxembourg – as world leaders gather in madrid for the united nations climate change conference ( cop25 ) meeting , they must address more than future greenhouse-gas reduction targets . at the same time , they must address the damage to the people and livelihoods that climate change already poses . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
this favorable performance led private forecasters and government officials alike to forecast continued robust growth in 2011 , with more output , jobs , and incomes leading to a further increase in consumer spending and a self-reinforcing recovery . a one-year cut of the payroll tax rate by two percentage points was enacted to lock in this favorable outlook . unfortunately , the supposed recovery in consumer spending did not happen at all . rising food and energy prices outpaced the gain in nominal wages , causing real median weekly earnings to decline in january , while the continued fall in home prices drove down wealth for most households . as a result , actual personal consumer expenditures shot up at an annual rate of just about 1 % in january , down from the previous quarter ’s ’s ’s 4 % rise .
instead , we are left with ordinary microeconomic measures to prepare people for algorithmic employment – that is , using big data to match people with the jobs they will need to remain consumers . time and again , we are told that future labor-market entrants should be equipped with job-targeted education and portable social-security pots to help them jump from one automated workplace to the next . when it comes to education , the report urges employers and colleges to work together to develop the talent “ pipelines . ” for example , it highlights the miami dade university ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ “ game development ” programs in animation and game development , working with companies like pixar animation studios and google . likewise , toyota “ built ” its own advanced manufacturing technician program to provide a pathway for company students seeking careers .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what will happen in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . last year ’s ’s united nations report on progress toward achieving the sdgs showed that the number of people facing hunger actually grows , as is the number of cases of malaria cases . moreover , according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the consequences of climate change emerge far more rapidly than anticipated .
québec will invest more than $ 3.3 billion toward this goal by 2020 , contributing to its economy ’s growth . basque country established a program called the local agenda 21 , designed to encourage the creation of local sustainability plans throughout the region . as a result of the program , nearly all basque municipalities have adopted such plans , consisting of more than 25,000 projects in areas like mobility , waste management , and economic development . these local schemes are now driving sustainable development across the region , with knowledge sharing among municipalities laying the foundations for continued progress . meanwhile , south australia has developed the most supportive regulatory framework for renewable-energy investment in australia , enabling an increase in ’ ’ renewables share from practically zero in 2003 to nearly 40 % today .
in the 1930 ’s , the countries that raised their tariffs and tightened their quotas the most were those with the least ability to manage their exchange rates , namely those countries that remained on the gold standard . in 1931 , after britain and some two dozen other countries suspended gold convertibility , and allowed their currencies to depreciate , countries stuck with the deflationary gold standard found themselves in a deflationary vice . in frantic efforts to do something – anything – to defend their economies turned toward protectionism , imposed “ exchange-rate dumping ” duties , and import quotas in order to compensate for lost competitiveness due to their own increasingly overvalued currencies . but trade restrictions were a poor substitute for domestic reflationary measures , because they did very little to arrest a downward spiral in output and prices . they did nothing to stabilize rickety banking systems .
madrid – since its inception in oslo almost two decades ago , the israeli-palestinian peace process has been stymied by the two sides ’ dysfunctional political systems . hostage to the impossible coalition and the settlement movement of free-lausda fanatics , israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leadership are seriously threatened . his palestinian counterparts are hardly in an even better situation . today , the clique that surrounds palestinian president mahmoud abbas embodies the bitter delusion that the peace process had signified the palestinians . moreover , the palestinian authority has come about neither representing the majority of palestinians nor ruled through democratic means .
this has fueled a growing sense of hopelessness – especially among men – manifests itself in the face of rising non-labor-force participation , aggravated health challenges , drug abuse , elevated suicide rates , and anti-government sentiment . countries experiencing soaring and rising economic inequalities often face political instability and political dysfunction . as policymaking becomes erratic , losing credibility , and becomes choked by gridlock , growth suffers , and the chances to achieve a prosperous form of inclusiveness decline . the result is a vicious circle in which government finds it increasingly difficult to do whatever it takes . but government interventions are crucial to address the challenges facing developed-country workers today that markets can not address alone .
the tribe can become a club , a clan , or a nation . prior to world war ii , soccer clubs often had an ethnic or religious component : tottenham hotspur in london was “ je” “ je” ; ” whereas the arsenal is “ irish . ” vestiges of these markings remain : adx from amsterdam is still taunted by provincial opponents as the “ jew ” club . and glasgow clubs , celtic and rangers remain divided by religious affiliation , celtic amongst jews and rangers protestant . but a collective race or religion is not essential .
at the same time , it is about spending more equitably . in a new imf-world bank spring report report , to save children documents a glaring gap between health risks that are strongly skewed toward some of the world ’s poorest children , and whose contribution to public expenditures is often skewed toward better-off households . this flies in the face of the central pledge governments made when they subscribed to the sdgs : that those countries , farthest from targets , would benefit from the fastest-growing progress . in the language of the agenda , “ nobody should be left behind . ” the world bank could help to improve the accountability needed by working with the un and national agencies to monitor and report on a pace at which disparities in core indicators , from mortality to education , are stretched .
two examples suffice to illustrate the impact : rice prices tripled , while electricity consumption was down by two-thirds from a peak of two decades ago . my personal memory of north korea , now almost 10 years old , is of a poor and depressed country . pyongyang , the capital , was a dark and barren , illuminated by the kavalcade , taking us from official housing to an opera house , only to return to darkness after us . kim jong-il was greeted with similar fervor when he entered the opera house that today marks a public mourning of his death . my trip came in april 2002 , a rather optimistic time .
but there are other gender goals to consider . the best way to reduce sexual violence against women , lift them out of poverty , and empower them full and equal members of society are to break the cycle of early marriage and childbirth . such a great change is not easy to achieve , but if girls can stay in school longer , and have decent job opportunities at their disposal after they are born , they are likely to marry and bear children later . in rural india , for example , recruiters for well-paying back-office jobs visited randomly selected villages over a period of three years . female employment rose and women aged 15-21 were less likely to marry or given birth over this period .
vice foreign minister kim kye-gwan conveyed the north ’s furious reaction : “ we do n’t hide our feeling of repugnance toward him . ” the north was not interested in a dialogue focused on coerced , “ unilateral nuclear abandonment . ” the “ world ” knows all too well that our country is neither libya nor iraq , which have met miserable fates . though trump has distanced himself from bolton ’s remarks , us vice president mike pence warned three weeks later that if north korea does not make such a deal , it really will meet with libya ’s destiny . choe son hui , foreign vice minister , responded by threatening a “ nuclear-to-nuclear showdown ” should washington be stuck to “ unlawful and outrageous ” belligerence .
after nearly 15 years of unprecedented growth – interrupted by only a brief slowdown from 2000-2001 – the united states accumulated massive stocks of foreign liabilities , the equivalent of 25 % of its gdp . with the current-account deficit now exceeding 5 % of gdp , america ’s foreign debt is rising fast . but no country can accumulate debt forever – and what can not last sooner or later must end . in early 1985 , when america ’s current-account deficit peaked at $ 120 billion , about a third of today ’s level at prevailing prices , the rest of the world stopped financing it . the outcome was a precipitous collapse in the dollar ’s value , which depreciated by 50 % against the deutschemark .
princeton – the united states has moved from an all-time high in the us presidential election to a low from a political sex scandal in a single brief week . for many americans , the election demonstrated what is best about the country , just following the sadly familiar process of knocking heroes off their pedestals . for many non-americans , the election brought barack obama ’s welcome and reassuring victory , whereas the resignation of david petraeus as cia director was an avoidable , self-inflicted wound . in fact , both the election and petraeus ’s resignation are crammed for much greater anywhere : an america that lives up to its promises . the us election has reminded many americans that the american country is committed to and able to advance progress – and to move forward toward an ideal vision .
the former casualty would have been whatever small margin remains for international policy coordination . the latter would have been the world ’s international monetary system , which is all but certain to cause it . in fact , one key reason for the international monetary fund ’s creation has been to monitor exchange-rate developments with the explicit objective of avoiding beggar-thy-neighbor policies . this is one reason why the swiss move comes in as a surprise . it is true that the franc has appreciated in real terms against 8 % since the crisis began in august 2007 .
the call issued by björn höcke , the afd ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s post-world war ii tradition of atoning ” for atoning ’s crimes in the nazi era , and afd deputy leader alexander gauland ’s reference to “ disregarding ” ” germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s integration minister “ turkish ” in anatolia , repelled voters . likewise , die linke ’s call to abolish nato alongside its cozying up to russia has left the party politically toxic in most western germany . the other widely cited cause of germany ’s ’s resilience against populism is its economic strength . the country ’s ’s ’s unemployment rate currently stands at a record low , with gdp growing by almost 10 % since 2013 . add to that a well-functioning welfare system , and it is clear why the inequality-focused outrage that fueled voter revolts elsewhere has gained little traction in germany .
tremendous fines have been placed against independent publications , broadcasters , and bloggers . china and turkey – both olympic-level jailers of journalists – have ramped up their repression in recent years . just last month , russian president vladimir putin signed new laws renting punishment by individuals and online media for spreading so-called fake news and information that “ disregarding ” ” the state . us president donald trump is attempting to move in the same direction . his constant branding of journalists as “ liars ” and “ enemies ” ” ” echoes the nazis ’ favored media label : the lügenpresse ( lying press ) .
without the advantages of trade , much of rural africa struggles over subsistence levels . bush may have thought that america does much to help overcome these problems , but the truth is that american aid is minuscule . blair ’s ’s ’s africa commission , like the un millennium project , discovered that africa needs around $ 50 billion a year in aid by 2010 . america ’s fair share of the global population is around $ 15 billion per year . yet official u.s. aid to africa is just $ 3 billion per year , and much of it covers salaries for american consultants , rather than investing in africa ’s ’s ’s ’s needs .
north korea is now the ninth us state with nuclear arms , joining the five permanent members of the un security council , israel , india , and pakistan . the danger is that there may be a quick approach to a tipping point . how the world reacts to north korea most likely affects the calculations of other would-be nuclear powers , including iran . preserving the peace in a world in which literally scores on nuclear triggers will be far more difficult – and the consequences of failure far more destructive . early reactions to north korea ’s nuclear test were uniformly critical , culminating ( thus far ) in united nations security council resolution 1718 to condemn the test , demands that north korea resume full-fledged cooperation with the international atomic energy agency and imposes a host of military , political , and economic sanctions .
industrialist wilbur ross , secretary of commerce secretary-designate was vocal in his desire to abrogate america ’s ’s ’s ’s “ “ dumb ” trade deals . peter navarro , an professor at california university ’s irvine university , will succeed him as director of the national commerce council – the new white house policy store to be established on a par with the us national security council and the national economic council . navarro is one of america ’s most extreme hawks in the world . the titles of his two most recent books – death by china ( 2011 ) and the crouching tiger : what china ’s militarism mean for the world ( 2015 ) – speak volumes of his tabloid-level biases . ross and navarro were also co-authors of the economic-policy stature paper published on the trump campaign ’s web site , which stretched any semblance of trustworthiness .
but , because policymakers continually victimized by qe , markets inferred that the ecb was not committed to sustained stimulus . thus , the euro-dollar ’s exchange rate barely moved down ; in fact , the euro appreciated against a basket of major currencies . eurozone inflation became “ de-anchored ” from monetary-policy decisions . the ecb then declared its victory prematurely , and withdrew qe just as the eurozone economy was slowing . the clash of interests among eurozone member states has been straightforward .
the experience suggests that the import of laws and the rule of law rarely worked well . for centuries , western law arrived with colonial rulers . even after european empires retreated , laws were still exported to foster development in postcolonial countries . in many cases , however , such imported laws were ignored , selectively enforced , or complied with only in form , not substance . american antitrust law , when transplanted to japan after world war ii by general macarthur , led only six criminal prosecution in thirty years .
but other firms have been charged with having a greater interest in developing a “ biobank ” of samples and data than with genetic testing . as jesse reynolds of the centre for genetics and society writes , “ just as traditional newspapers ’ business models are to extract revenues not from their readers but from advertisers , personal genomic companies see potential profits not from consumers themselves but from those compiled by databases – probably in the form of sales access to them . ” drug companies and other firms may well be keen to purchase the biobanks on which they can test their products for differential responses according to patients ’ genetic make-up . this new development , called “ “ “ pharmacogenetics , ” aims to deliver a better-calibrated dosages and more efficient therapies . there is certainly nothing wrong with this , but it seems odd that customers effectively pay a firm for the privilege of donating their dna to his database .
europe ’s banks holding greek government debt might hold pretend to value its full value . and the european central bank would hold fewer excuses to reject greek bonds as collateral . the question is whether altering the coupons – possibly accompanied by an extension of maturities – would be enough to stabilize the greek economy and restore growth . even with an german-level interest rate on the cheap , greece would need to run a primary surplus of at least 2 % of gdp – still quite large and far from today ’s current-account deficit . and , confronted with the value of greece ’s debt unchanged , the psychological drag on expectations and investment could linger .
excessive fiscal and monetary expansion enabled these economies to become fragile . current-account deficits were growing , resulting in frequent foreign-exchange crises . the combination of social polarization , weak institutions , and weak economic fundamentals made it hard for even reform-minded governments to escape the deflationary trap and laid the groundwork for long-term development . against this background , “ neoliberal ” reforms – for example , faster economic opening and fiscal liberalization promoted by the international monetary fund – made economies even more vulnerable to external shocks . venezuela is a case at point .
movies produced for sexual gratification of consumers expose the cultural norms of restrictions , ingression , and otherness . in fact , portugal is so specifically tuned to consumers ’ tastes that shifts can indicate change in a society almost instantly . interestingly , many purveyors of pornography initially thought that better quality video would make their products more desirable . nevertheless , high production values seem to have actually been less popular . thus , a “ casual ” style of production has been embraced , similar to that of the design of worn and ripped jerusalem .
but it has never aspired to lead a country . former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra have done – and still do . neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader . the question , then , is getting worse . clowns have always played a role in politics .
eventually , city and urban areas driving the bulk of the new creation of wealth will provoke a countermovement . if they price out , or otherwise exclude those who earn less , they will sacrifice the level of openness that made them attractive in the first place . thus , if they are to survive and thrive in today ’s egalitarian political climate , they will need to come forward with bold solutions . during an earlier era of urban-based dynamism in the early sixth century , abundant merchant families built low-rent housing that they then allocate to the poor . one such project , the fuggerei complex at augsburg , still provides low rent of social housing for this day .
georges clémenceau , jean jaurès and raymond poincaré at the beginning of the twentieth century , did not pander to the almost half of the electorate whom , during the dreyfus affair , exiled themselves from the republic . nor did charles de gaulle have any qualms about telling french algeria ’s proponents that , at long last , he failed to understand them . nor were pierre mendès france in the 1950 ’s neglected to say the communists that he refused to want their votes to support his rule . france must now recall those brilliant moments in its republican tradition , and hold them up as a model for today ’s leaders . for what will be needed to hold territories that the republic has almost lost to the fn is the political mettle of a sort that , for the moment , is in short supply .
and we know that those landings created a unique attachment among our continents . that bond remains vitally important for preserving our own values and our own security . yet , in the wake of the cold war , many assumed that its institutional incarnation – the north atlantic treaty organization – would fade away . it did not , because our bonds were based not merely on shared threats , but on shared ideals . it could not have been more fade away than our yearning for freedom could wane .
china does not alone favors the remaining time-warped in the maoist 1960 ’s when discussing the topic . the chinese have been so clever in so many areas . they have devised the “ one country , ” two systems ” formula for hong kong . is it really beyond their political system ’s capacity to work out a formula for tibet recognizing its cultural and religious autonomy within the chinese state ? i hope that the issue does not derail a chinese effort to use the olympics as an opportunity to showcase the world that their country emerged again as one of the world ’s leaders .
sarajevo – ever since the double disaster of 2016 – the united kingdom ’s ’s brexit referendum and us president donald trump ’s ’s election – widespread anxiety has fueled widespread anxiety about a “ global wave of populism , ” and hand-wringing over the unfolding disaster of so-called “ direct democracy . ” in the uk , voters were asked to answer an overly simplistic in-or-or-out question ; in the united states , the 2016 republican party ’s primaries were handed over to irresponsible voters and radical activists . since then , calls to re-empower the “ gatekeepers ” have been added , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” a cogent way to keep the masses off from political decision-making at all times . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
berkeley – to fix the problem , it is not enough to know what to do . indeed , you need to implement solutions – and are willing to change course when it shows that you did n’t know pretty much as you imagined . that ’s the message of two recent books that , collectively , tells you everything you need to know about the 2008 financial crisis : what caused it , what could be done to prevent it from being recurring , and why so far these things have been made . the first book is the shifts and aftershocks , by the conservative british journalist martin wolf , who begins by cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for an economic disaster that continues to shape the world today . its starting point is the massive rise of wealth among the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s richest 0.1 % and $ 0.01 % , and consequent pressures for people , governments , and companies to take on increasingly unsustainable levels of debt .
this has its advantages , but it also carries serious risks – beginning with the loss of journalistic standards of excellence , like those typically enforced within established media organizations . without the traditional institutional gatekeepers , the political discourse is no longer based on a common set of facts . the other feature of the digital information age – a direct by-product of democratization – is a direct by-product of democratization – of information . rather than securing our insights directly from the institutional gatekeepers that , despite often-faulty execution , were fundamentally committed to meeting editorial norms , today we acquire it through peer-to-peer sharing . such peer networks can elevate content based on factors like clicks or engagement among friends , rather than accuracy or importance .
heavy tv viewing , moreover , has added fuel to social fragmentation . the time that used to be spent collectively within communities now spends on the screen . robert putnam , america 's leading scholar ’s declining sense of community , has discovered that tv viewing is the central explanation of the decline in “ social capital , ” ” ” ” ” ” the trust that binds communities together . americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago . of course , many other factors come at work but television-driven social atomization should not be understated .
in fact , this perilous and irresponsible activism remains another crucial sign yet that china ’s rise as a global power lacks any guarantee that it will once constituted a peaceful nation strong . it flatly contradicts china ’s repeated assurances that china ’s ’s rise would bring only “ harmony ” and tranquility to the international community . lurking beyond china ’s own space-related ambition is the spirit of the cold war , which continues to permeate the inner high-command circles of us military high command circles , whose adversary , unmistakably , is the united states . with the collapse of the soviet-era communist regime , america continues to enjoy the dominant role in space exploration for peaceful and scientific evolution . but , since the 1980 ’s , america has been ambivalent about the ultimate military and civilian utility of its space efforts .
illegality and wrongdoers were artfully cloaked as an incontrovertible , the science-tested natural law , “ the survival of the fittest . ” every time a new , powerful scientific formulation seems to be going through a period of abusive application . today , it is the turn of molecular genetics . temperament , obesity , heart disease , intelligence , homosexuality , or criminal behavior : everything is said to reside in the genes . distinguished scientists proclaim that our very destiny inscribed at the molecule , and the science-popularizers join an exultant joir to asserting that human beings are anything but “ programmed ” subjects .
around its picturesque squares , each of the cobblestone and ornamental façade borne quiet witness to the bloodletting that accompanied the empires ’ rise and fall . yet hviv is also where one can find hope for europe ’s promise . leviv is a profoundly anti-european and pro-european city ; but , for five days each summer , it hosts alpha jazz festival , sponsored by a russian bank . at a time when russia and ukraine still seem very much at war , policymakers , local citizens , members of the ukrainian diaspora , and even some russians pack the streets of lviv to celebrate world-class jazz . beyond its vital cultural life and geographic location , ukraine matters strategically to the west .
palo alto – it is still too soon to gauge the full economic impact of president barack obama ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s implementation and proposed policies , but tentative read indicates limited shorter-term benefits at large long-term costs . the administration is exploiting a crisis atmosphere to enact a huge agenda that would re-engineer the american economy , from autos and financial services to healthcare , energy , and income distribution . obama has outsourced the details of the $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus to congress , and , no surprise , the old barons of the home well stuffed it with their pork and social engineering . a few months later , only 4 % of gdp has been spent , and the federal government is brow-beating state governments – for example , demanding that california rescind a small pay cut for some unionized workers or lost $ 7 billion in stimulus funds . ( intervening in contractual relations ex post to enforce union demands is an emerging characteristic of the administration . )
just as europeans are well aware , there can be no road to building a wall in the mediterranean . moreover , what is disturbing is that the trump administration has hardly ever discussed for upholding the postwar liberal international order . instead , it views the world as a zero-sum strategic contest , in which an america should look only to itself . sadly , in a world without common institutions to restrain sovereign states from escalating conflicts with one another , the risks of an all-out war will grow substantially . to be sure , the u.k. argues for sticking its commitment to european security .
the old model served both sides well for at least three decades . china ’s ’s ’s growth was driven by labor-intensive exports made it more competitive through technology transfers and knowledge-intensive knowledge transfers from the us and other western countries . this , combined with massive chinese public and private investment ( enabled by high – and , more recently , excess capacity – underpinned rising incomes for millions of chinese . at the same time , america ’s consumer , meanwhile , benefited enormously from falling relative prices of manufactured goods in the tradable side of the us economy . america ’s jobs shifted to higher-value-added activities , in turn supporting higher incomes in america , too .
a profound change of america ’s strategic priorities under president donald trump demands that europeans revisit long-held assumptions about their collective defense . this is not the first time that nato seems to have gotten its last legs . until 2014 , many arrived at the same conclusion , when the alliance had little to concentrate beyond missions in afghanistan . having annexed crimea and brought a war in eastern ukraine , russia breathed new life in nato . then came trump , whose administration withdrew the rug from beneath europe ’s feet ; abandoned american leadership within a rules-based international system ; and pursued a nationalistic , protectionist , and unilateralist foreign policies .
first , fiscal-stimulus policies , which currently push america ’s annual growth rate above its 2 % potential , are unsustainable . by 2020 , the stimulus will run out , with a modest fiscal drag pulling growth from around 3 % to just below 2 % . second , because the stimulus was ill-timed , america ’s economy now overshoots , with inflation rising above target . so the u.s. federal reserve will therefore keep pushing up the federal funds rate from its current 2 % to at least 3.5 % by 2020 , and this will likely push short – and long-term interest rates , like the american dollar . meanwhile , us inflation is also on the rise in other key economies , with rising oil prices contributing additional inflationary pressures .
in fact , american and british soldiers may simply have themselves to blame . heightened drift has been one of the effects observed during and after the initial gulf war . this is because a desert in the region normally has a crust , what arabs call “ a skin desert , ” consisting of sand and clay particles that have been baked together or sintered through heat and sunshine through sunshine . sometimes this crust is strong enough to perform a person and at times , much like the hard-ice crust that develops on snow in colder climates . under the crust , bird particles are loose .
other women , such as their self-professed mistress judith campbell , reportedly had sexual ties with mafia figures as well . the feeling of entitlement that sustained such male fecklessness has been eroded steadily since – a process that , like so much in american culture , played out on television . popular series , like “ good wife , ” shows the pain and suffering of political ceremonies that are expected to maintain a rigid upper lip and a ladylike demeanor in the face of behavioral double standards . likewise , the spate of mad men , ” ” ” ” ” ” with his dashing publicity managers who consume women like lunchtime cocktails , the plumbs the emptiness and destructiveness of early-1960s ’s male sexual privilege . this reevaluation of male sexual privilege and irresponsibility in the 1960s occurred in other arenas as well – reinforcing the transformation of kennedy ’s image from a charming playboy to a dangerously compulsive predator .
one key element of the last year is that financial market problems lie not just with hedge funds – which are the largest and least regulated gamblers – but with good old commercial banks showing an uncanny ability to create trouble through excessively risky gamble , whether in loans to emerging markets or for the likes of ltcm . the banks that lent huge sums , most of them unpayable , to ltcm , are the same sort that put in about $ 175 billion of short-term loans to the five east asian developing countries ( indonesia , korea , malaysia , the philippines , thailand ) and then abruptly reversed gears and yanked off tens of billions of loans between 1997 and 1998 . oddly , chase manhattan reports that it had exposure to some $ 32 billion in loans and derivatives at ltcm , roughly 2 % of bank aggregate credit and credit exposure at just a single hedge fund ! ltcm also illustrates some truths about financial-sector crises . when push came to shove , with ltcm on the brink of collapse , the us federal reserve did not simply let “ market forces ” take their course .
cambridge – nowadays , public-private cooperation or coordination receives significant attention . a plethora of centers for studying entrepreneurship and government relations was created , with researchers producing great design literature , analysis , and assessment of public-private partnerships . even the world economic forum was transformed by the international organization for public-private collaboration . to be sure , private-private coordination has been the essence of economics over the last 250 years . while adam smith started us on the side of the optimistic conviction that an invisible hand would look after most coordination issues , in intervening times of economists discovered all kinds of market failures , informational imperfections , and incentives problems that gave away rules , regulation , and other forms of government and societal interference .
president-elect ’s daughter , ivanka trump , is spearheading the effort . while it is easy to be cynical ( some will say that a new program is just a pretext for cutting funds from existing retraining programs ) , the idea that digital platforms can massively upgrade re-education and training sounds good . but , while the trump administration has been strengthening america ’s economy ’s long-run growth potential in some ways , the other side of the ledger looks rather gloomy . for starters , a broad range of studies – from the work of the late economist david landes to more recent research by mit ’s daron acemoglu and the university of chicago ’s james a. robinson – find that institutions and political culture are the single most important determinants of long-term growth . recovery from hurting trump is inflicting on institutions and political culture in america could take years ; if it does , the economic costs could be substantial .
now , most economists seem to believe that russia can not keep annual gdp growth at just above 2 % without another steady rise in oil prices . but a 2 % growth rate ( a respectable rate for an advanced economy ) would represent a major blow to russia ’s standing and putin ’s own ’s personal prestige , and might endanger domestic stability if jobs disappear with critical manufacturing industries . putin is perplexed at how to counter the threat posed by sluggish growth . so far , his main proposal has featured a “ eurasian union ” – an expanded version of the current customs union among russia , belarus , and kazakhstan . this would provide a platform for re-establish trade , transportation , and other links among the former soviet countries , and thereby capture regional markets for russian products , ensure russians ’ jobs , and re-assert russia ’s political influence in its old neighborhood .
the ecb , quite sensibly , wants all of the potential horrors to become visible before a takeover – so that it can not blame . with national supervisors often inclined to present a rosy image of their countries ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ institutions , no longer in charge , we can hope that an examination will become more robust than the earlier stress tests conducted under the auspices of the european banking authority ( eba ) . those trials , in contrast to their equivalent in the united states , have failed to restore trust . the few banks that passed with flying colors were soon obliged to raise new capital . but the creation of a european banking union was not the only important change to europe ’s financial regulation since the crisis .
not all of them succeeded ; but the achievements ( germany , for example ) far outweighed the failures ( see greece ) . the key to ensuring europe ’s future , and therefore its social model , lies in faster growth . and , once again , it is hard to see how more europe would improve the situation . the obstacles to growth are well known , and have existed for some time without being able to take away . the reason is quite simple : if there were some politically easy path to generate growth , it already would have been realized .
many state-owned firms were privatized for more than ten times the sums yielded in asset sales under edvard shevardnadze 's previous reign . but the utter lack of transparency allowed for russia 's companies and its subsidiaries registered in third world countries to snap most new offerings . typical was russia 's holding company promyslennye ( industrial investors ) , which succeeded in obtaining a major gold mine , and then as much as half of a gold-alloys plant . russia 's main georgian foreign policy apparatus , is gazprom , a state-controlled gas monopoly . gazprom 's ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s aim is to control not only the georgian gas industry , but also the one pipeline that feeds russian gas against both georgian and armenia .
as always , major sacrifices are civilians being caught in the crossfire . renewed combat , coming eight months after the promising peace initiative , known as the “ caucasus deal , ” implies more civilian deaths , and little chance of normalcy returning to the eastern district of congo . yet , even at a time when fighting is less intense congo suffers from the war ’s indirect effects . a mortality survey conducted by the international rescue committee ( irc ) and released earlier this year illustrates that conflict is the world ’s ’s ’s ’s most deadly crisis since world war ii : an estimated 5.4 million people have perished as a consequence of the war and its lingering effects in the past decade . today , one-quarter of all this million people are currently on running , nearly half on rebel-controlled territory , and with virtually no access to aid .
henry kissinger once said , “ peace can achieve only through hegemony or through a balance of power . ” the same could perhaps be said of trade , or even of globalization itself . it is no accident that the two great eras of globalization – the decades leading up to world war i and the past 75 years – were characterized by a balance of power and hegemony , respectively . to be sure , trade requires more than the absence of conflict . like all economic activity , it flourishes when property rights are respected ; taxation is efficient and purposeful ; credit letters are honored ; tariffs and other barriers are removed ; and so forth .
for small and medium-size enterprises , externships provide much-needed , creative manpower . for larger corporations , they are avenues for corporate citizenship and innovation . when properly integrated with a college education student , externships can lay off the competitive edge on college app essays and at campus , or alumni interviews that admissions committees increasingly use to differentiate twenty-first-century leaders from competing top-scoring hordes takers . externships offer the transparency and responsibility of educators , and they can justify courses in students ’ fearlessness . our educational system can no longer afford to wall out of the industrial world .
but a few million americans – black , white , and hispanic – now reside in middle-income households with per capita incomes of less than $ 2 per day , essentially the same standard used by the world bank to define hiv/aids tion-level poverty in india or africa . finding shelter in the united states about that income is so hard that $ 2-a-day poverty is almost certainly much worse in america than $ 2-a-day poverty in india or africa . beyond that , america has ’s much-vaunted equality of opportunity under threat . the towns and cities that lost their factories to globalization have also lost their tax bases , finding it hard to keep quality schools – the escape route for future generations . elite schools recruit wealthy to pay their bills and court minorities to remedy centuries of discrimination ; but this undoubtedly fosters resentment among the white working class , whose children find no room in this brave new world .
once a company identifies which users enjoy the most influence – well-known bloggers , for example – it may offer better treatments , in the hope of urging them to recommend a service . web startups might even want to check their users ’ profiles on the angel listing database of angel investors , viewing them as a potential source of funding . others might use services , such as intercom , to gain insight into their users ’ interests – from their music preferences to their favorite hobbies – to offer more personalized services . indeed , many online services now offer to link users with their facebook friends or linkedin contacts , or to recommend actions or restaurants based on past behavior or present location . some people do n’t want this kind of attention , whether because they already detect personalities attempting to fend off adoring fans or mooches , or , or simply because they are uncomfortable with unfamiliar entities knowing so much about them .
french catholics now feel as though their historically privileged position comes under assault – the rise of islam and islamist-inspired terrorist attacks and legislation that increasingly challenged their way of life . for many conservative catholics , same-sex marriage was a tipping point , while left-wing catholics found themselves crammed through the right . french politics did not have analogue american alt-right milieu – with its conspiracy theory , talk shows , online thames , and fake news – that fueled trump ’s campaign . but fillon ’s ’s ’s supporters , too , rejected multiculturalism , and responded to its status anxieties by dismissing expertise . with france becoming less catholic , and america becoming more heterogeneous , their “ zombie ” armies ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ political power will decay ; but , as trump ’s election and fillon ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political ascendance demonstrated , they can not simply be written off .
for better or for worse , our central banks manage the quantity and flow of money by withdrawing or adding paper assets to stock held by private banks . when they want to spur economic activity , central banks buy out privately owned banks ’ commercial loans , mortgages , deposits , and other assets . after all , the banks then hold more cash to lend . and vice versa , when the authorities want to cool down the economy . but the more successful libra becomes , the more money people transfer from their bank account to their libra wallet , and the less capable central banks will be to stabilize the economy .
with the american invasion of iraq in 2003 , french-american relations reached a very low point . the bush administration felt betrayed by the french diplomatic tactic in the united states , while french president jacques chirac felt validated in his mistrust of the soft superpower and its call for a multipolar world . today , on the eve of the french presidential election , opinion polls indicate that three-quarters of french voters believe that france should distance itself from the united states . despite a long history of alliance dating back to the american revolution , and including two world wars , france has always had a rather ambivalent attitude toward the us , and the iraq war was not the first time that a controversial us security policy undercut america ’s attractiveness in france . polls show similar reactions following the suez crisis of 1956 , the vietnam war in the late 1960 ’s and early 1970 ’s , and the intermediate-range missiles in europe in the early 1980 ’s .
they can do this in a variety of ways , such as by investing in education , financing science , and technology r & d , and by building efficient infrastructure . tax competition is not the way to go , not least because it reduces the revenues needed to make such investments , particularly in developing countries , which report by the international monetary fund ’s 2015 report lose out on more than $ 200 billion per year , owing to tax avoidance by multinational companies . when countries create tax regimes that are effectively designed to steal tax revenues from others , the result is also lower money for education , health care , poverty-reduction programs , and climate-change measures . this should not be allowed , and multinational companies should stop adding the problem by threatening to leave countries unless taxes are slashed . after all , a fundamental corporate-social responsibility principle is that firms should pay their fair share of taxes wherever they operate .
what ’s more , the rapid expansion of the etfs coincided with bull markets . index performance largely dictated by security selection , and asset allocation meant little more than stockpiled into stocks , bonds , and credit . but those days , too , seem to be coming to an end . further sustained market advances are unlikely , given stretched stocks and bond valuations , slowing economic and earnings growth , and heightened political and political uncertainty . broad market returns are likely to remain lower , with episodes of volatility probably more frequent .
cambridge : economics teaches that measure individual ’s well-being is the quantity and variety of goods that it or can consume . consumption possibilities are in turn maximized by giving firms the freedom they need to exploit new technologies , division of labor , economies of scale , and mobility . consumption is the goal ; production is the means . markets , rather than communities , are the unit and the object of analysis . nobody can deny that this consumer – and a market-centric vision of an economy has produced plenty of fruit .
fragmentation – meaning the end of the internet – is a very real threat . some estimates put the internet ’s economic contribution to global gdp as high as $ 4.2 trillion in 2016 . a fragmented “ splinternet ” would be extremely costly for the world , but that is one of the possible futures outlined last month in a report by the world commission on internet governance , chaired by former swedish prime minister carl bildt . the internet now links nearly half of the world ’s ’s ’s ’s population , with an additional billion people serving as some 20 billion devices – predicting connections in the next five years . but further expansion is not guaranteed , either .
that sounded like a comfortable experience – perhaps learning experiences – for young men , who would otherwise be idle and unemployed . but it was no great inspiration for the future that may help to explain why franklin roosevelt ’s new deal failed to end america ’s economic malaise . on the other hand , the apparent relative strength of america ’s economy today may reflect some very visible recent inspirations . a fracking revolution , widely viewed originating in the us , helped by lower energy prices , and wiped out america ’s dependency on foreign oil . likewise , much speedier advances in communications over the past few years reflected innovations – smartphone and tablet hardware and software , for example , that were indigenous in america .
and roughly 445 million will require improved access to safe water supplies – part of the reduction of unpaid care work carried out by women in developing countries . this ambitious agenda will not be delivered effectively without action by governments working in concert with the private sector and nongovernmental organizations . it will require additional investment , generating job opportunities for women , and introducing measures to help women move to more productive work . mgi has identified several interventions worldwide , which could readily be deployed more broadly . measures that are proven to improve access to education include building more secondary schools , ensuring that girls are provided with sanitation facilities when they study , and creating financial incentives – including cash transfers – to raise enrollment and keep girls in school .
the unhcr , as it has currently conceived , is not an independent , nonpartisan agency that it claims . heavily dependent on donors and host governments to launch relief operations is beholden to its interests , and it does not always have the political backing it needs to get the job done . its other major multilateral agency for migration , the iom , assists at the return of migrants , asylum-seekers , refugees , and internally displaced to their place of origin , or to other countries or regions that have agreed to accept them . but , like the unhcr , governance issues plague the iom . in particular , the iom lacks a mechanism to evaluate whether national governments profit from coercion – forbidden under international law – to repatriate or relocate refugees .
with political gridlock blocking an adequate fiscal response – after the 2008 global financial crisis – the united states congress ran out of an annual budget , a fundamental component of responsible economic management for five years now , central banks have been lured to bolster economies artificially . to do this , they have relied on near-zero interest rates and unconventional measures , like quantitative easing ( qe ) to spur growth and job creation . beyond being incomplete , this approach has implicitly favors the wealthy , who hold an disproportionately large part of financial assets . meanwhile , companies have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to reduce their tax bills , including through so-called inversions , by moving their headquarters to lower-tax jurisdictions . as a result , most countries are facing a trio of inequalities – of income , wealth , and opportunity – that , left unchecked , reinforce another , with far-reaching consequences .
and even the administration ’s ’s ’s plan to favor skilled over unskilled workers will not necessarily diminish the number of legitimate migrants in countries . all told , trump has governed like a plutocrat in populist dress – that is , a pluto-populist . but why has his base allowed him to get away with pursuing policies that mostly hurt them ? according to one view , he is betting that social conservatives and white-blue-collar supporters in rural areas would vote against both nationalist and religious sentiment and antipathy toward secular coastal elites , rather than toward their own financial interests . but how long can one expect to favor “ god ” and guns ” at the expense of “ bread-and-butter ” ?
the holiday received its current name in 2006 , and , according to a recent survey by the russian pollster fom , 59 % of russians regard it as odd or substantial ( 32 % do not ) . unfortunately , february 23 is not the only remaining relic of the red army . another soviet-style military legacy is the obligatory system . whereas all other large european countries abolished military conscription in recent decades , russia continues with a system in which all physically-fit male citizens between 18 and 27 must serve for 12 months . exemptions are based on medical terms and given to university students and staff members of specific organizations ( such as the police ) .
paris – tunisia , one of the arab league ’s 22 members , stands out in the throes of a sweeping and profound crisis , if perhaps one with a nice resolution . it is the smallest northern african country , covering 163,000 square kilometers – more or less three-fourths of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg – and contains some 10.5 million people . it is also packed with charm and moderation in terms of its climate , history , and culture . it once was part of the cultural dynamism and influence of both the roman republic and the empire . the first african region to be christianized , was saint augustine and a major source for catholic evangelism in africa .
true , any arab – indeed , virtually anyone – knows precisely who is responsible for khashoggi ’s disappearance : crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia . but a well-known cartoonist has had to hide the culprit ’s image speaks volumes about the fear felt by an independent journalist in the arab world . khashoggi ’s disappearance has merely deepened their anxieties . arab countries have a long history of rewarding journalists who toe an official line while punishing those , like khashoggi , who dare to speak truth to power . since the failed arab spring revolutions – which tunisia is the only success story – citizens across the region have found themselves with a stark choice between radical islamist regimes and military rule .
reversing financial liberalization will be difficult , but its adverse side effects – including more systemic risk – will require a range of reform measures . first , more information and transparency about complex assets , and who holds them out . second , complex instruments should be traded on exchanges , rather than on over-the-counter markets , and they should be standardized in a way that can arise liquid secondary markets . third , we need better supervision and regulation of the financial system , including regulation of opaque or highly leveraged financial institutions , such as hedge funds and even sovereign-wealth funds . fourth , the ratings agencies ’ role needs rethought , with more regulation and competition introduced .
and yet it is only one part of the many domestic challenges facing the region . arabs need to take charge of their own agendas , becoming the primary power that defines their futures and that of their countries . of course , they should continue engaging with the outside world , reinforcing their strategic relationships and alliances . but they also need to become less interdependent to others . for starters , the region ’s governments need to develop their own national-security capabilities , defend against non-existential threats and hegemonic expansionism .
now , a new paper by servaas the storm effectively obfuscates another famous trope in neoliberal economics : the argument that the labor market ’s “ rigidities ” depress output and employment . one of the empirical investigations most frequently cited for this argument is paper by timothy besley and robin burgess using production data across indian states during the 1958-92 period . besley and goad argue that pro-worker regulation in some states led to lower output , employment , investment , and productivity , and even increase urban poverty , relative to states that did not enact such regulations . this finding emerged to underpin the conventional wisdom that labor-market regulation is harmful to industrial expansion , and that the way to boost output and employment in manufacturing is to encourage more labor-market “ flexibility ” by repealing laws protecting workers . that wisdom prevailed not only in india ; it influenced policies accordingly across a wide range of developing countries .
britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic prospects increasingly depend on events beyond its mediterranean shores , whether just across the english channel or in china or california . the fact is that environmental hazards are being buffeted by spiking in august . swelling migration pressures threaten to overwhelm any pretense of border controls . indeed , security concerns increasingly implicate foreign and domestic policies in parallel . a recent political cartoon showing british bombers off on a un mission with one pilot saying to the rest , “ it seems a long way off to bomb a few young men from south london . ”
after that election , perhaps heady with the magnitude of its support , he proposed a deepening revolution with new laws on the organization of society and economy . such laws , already enacted but not being implemented fully , should be the catalyst for a new institutional arrangement within the country , one supposedly premised on the direct relationship between the leader and the people , and the progressive hollowing out of the country ’s democratic institutions . meanwhile , all bodies of public power – all of them – now follow chávez . given this history , he is noteworthy that in his acceptance of the day after his victory , chávez called for coexistence , dialogue , debate , and all to collaborate on behalf of venezuela ’s good . he emphasizes that the very people voted for chávez and socialism .
moreover , genes can be harmed by environmental factors such as radiation and chemicals . they can also be harmed by the products of normal metabolism . our bodies have computerized systems that maintain the integrity of our genes , even in the presence of harmful agents . occasionally , however , the damage is not being corrected . when the damage occurs in the key genes that regulate cell growth , cancer can develop .
ithaca – the internet was once hailed as a powerful democratizing force – – – enabling innovative startups to compete for established firms , disrupt entire industries , and create new ones . but , as some of those startups grew out of behemoths , this power has turned on their head . far from leveling the playing field , big tech is now mostly owns ; and , rather than democratizing the economy , the internet ended in exacerbating the global problem of inequality . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
“ “ “ the developing world , ” “ can make matters much worse . ” in announcing a new sino-us joint research effort , chu has described clean energy as “ “ “ one of our time ” for sino-us cooperation , ” arguing that by “ working together , we can accomplish more than [ by acting on one side . ” still , one remains to wonder whether this newly collaborative bonhomie and ethnic bonding will prove strong enough to cut through not only the long history of distrustful interactions between the us and china , but also the destabilizing effects of china ’s abrupt economic rise ? for , though the u.s. has drawn strength from the ideal of the “ melting pot ” – and president barack obama ’s ’s cabinet represents a new high-water mark for diversity – americans have often shown a xenophobic mistrust of migrants who have drawn too close to power . particularly for chinese , fears about divided national loyalties and the “ fifth columnists ” have been potent .
greece ’s economic weakness raises the current-account level . five years of falling gdp have depressed tax receipts and increased transfer payments . the imf estimates that these deflationary effects on revenues and outlays have raised the overall deficit to almost 5 % of greek gdp . on a cyclically adjusted basis , greece ’s ’s overall budget would show a current-account surplus of 0.6 % of gdp this year . this , too , implies that if greece could escape from its current recession , its national debt would decline , both perfectly and as a gdp share .
as indian prime minister manmohan singh put it during wen ’s visit , “ india and china can together reshape the world order . ” the two countries ’ recent rapprochement marks an enormous change from the hostility that bedeviled their relations following its 1962 war over a disputed frontier in the himalayas . when i first visited india as an american administration official in the late 1970 ’s , i was struck by my indian hosts ’ fixation on gaining an equal status with china . in 1998 , when india tested its nuclear weapons , its secretary of defense referred to china , and then prime minister atal bihari vajpayee spoke of china as india ’s number one enemy . by contrast , on more recent visits to india , i found my hosts chanting the need to learn from china .
since hildebrand was wealthy , this approach would not have worked easily with it . so , has he received the stick rather than the carrot ? fortunately , there is a good independent test of the international monetary fund . the head of the european banking authority , andrea enria , has issued new non-bank-non-bank-friendly regulations . while one may debate the appropriateness of tightening accounting standards in the midst of a crisis , his ordering banks to raise their capital is totally justified , especially at a time when the european central bank subsidizes them with a wall of three-year liquidity at near-zero cost .
second , and in part as an afterthought , virtually all eurozone countries ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ debt trades are trading at a discount relative to german bunds . while it has been forced to price risk more precisely , it is hard to believe that the netherlands , with its debt-to-gdp ratio nearly 20 percentage points lower than germany ’s , deserves to be considered above default risk . now , however , even the mighty bund have started to suffer from heightened market anxieties . third , financial-market participants , and , increasingly , actual firms are pricing in a possible breakup of the eurozone , if not an end in the euro itself . it remains hard to think that the unthinkable , let alone work out the details of it , but any rational player now needs to consider the possibility .
indeed , by luck on sunday a young soccer fan had been murdered in moscow , vladislav surkov , the first deputy in president dmitri medvedev 's ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s administration meeting michael mcfaul of us president barack obama 's national security council . that meeting was played out as part of a gathering headed by surkov , of the russian youth-movement activists . one quote of surkov , who day is especially telling : “ “ “ make ready for elections , ” train your brains and muscles . you can always count on our backing . those arabs were put in arms to use outside the kremlin wall that very day .
hong kong – sesame street ’s kermit once lamented that “ it ’s not easily bein greece . ” today , that sentiment is surprisingly relevant to the global economy – only to become green that poses the problem . last september , the intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that if a world stick with “ “ business as usual , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” global temperatures could rise above 4 ° c – well beyond the 2 ° c rise deemed to be “ safe ” . this prompted un secretary-general ban ki-moon to call into question political , economic , and financial leaders in january to reinvigorate their efforts to achieve a new global climate-change deal by 2015 . but , just as important as high-level deals are , they would amount to little unless they are backed by meaningful investment in areas like clever grids , energy storage , and renewables .
the search for a new managing director of the imf provides a stark reminder of just how unjust today ’s international institutions are . created in the postwar world of 1945 , they reflect the realities that have long ceased to exist . the organization and the allocation of power within the un , the imf , the world bank , and the g7 meetings reflects a global balance that had vanished long before . after wwii germany and japan were the defeated aggressors , the soviet union posed a major threat , and china was engulfed in a civil war that would thrust mao ’s communists into power . much of the so-called third world was either recently independent or remains colonies ; all were extremely poor .
just before the 2016 brexit referendum , then-british prime minister david cameron made a last-minute appeal to german chancellor angela merkel , imploring her to agree to an eu-wide movement cap in the united kingdom . merkel had refused , and the brexit referendum passed a narrow margin . the irony now is that merkel now confronts the same anti-immigration backlash that cameron did in 2016 . immigration tends to be good for an economy over the long term , especially if the ratio of pensioners to workers rises . but when immigration levels exceed a country ’s capacity to absorb newcomers , severe economic and social costs can arise , at least in the short term .
the odious debt idea was revived in an influential 2006 article by seema jayachandran and michael kremer , and , in a 2010 report by the centre for global development ( cgd ) that proposed that economic sanctions include a mechanism aimed at preventing the accumulation of odious obligations . the mechanism would take shape the declaration , which debt issued by a specific government would have been deemed odious . in effect , this is what the trump administration has just done . such a declaration lowers the flow of funding to odious regimes , owing to the risk that successor governments renting their predecessor ’s debts without incurring legitimate and reputational costs ( because participating countries ’ courts do not enforce debt contracts ) . the cgd ’s report suggests that a regime should be seen as odious if it abuses people ’s rights , employs military coercion , perpetrating electoral fraud , and misrewarding or misappropriates public money .
that cleansed the way for bhutto ’s return , which remains prime minister until 1996 , when she was sacked yet again – this time by her own pakistan peoples ’ party . in 1997 , it was sharif ’s turn again . but his military-to-military confrontation intensified over the years , resulting in yet another military coup in 1999 , leading to eight years of military rule under general pervez musharraf . in 2008 , musharraf resigned as part of popular pressure , and a new election brought asif zardari , benazir bhutto ’s widower , who was assassinated earlier december , to the presidency . ignoring constitutional demands , zardari failed to transfer executive authority to his prime minister , and , instead , expected the two prime ministers serving under him to follow his orders .
wealthy countries ’ shifting from subsistence economies to sustained growth and prosperity has been conditioned on a profound demographic shift -- occurring in the year 19 th century in western europe and around the twentieth century in east asia -- in which fertility rates have fallen dramatically . the past two decades have witnessed similarly sharp birth declines in poor countries , which are now showing solid signs of economic progress . in egypt , for example , fertility rates have declined from 4.8 - to 2.9 children per woman over the past 15 years . during the past decade , egypt ’s average annual per capita income grew at a rate of 2.6 % . over the same period , tunisia ’s population growth rate fell by more than 50 % , to europe ’s level of slightly more than two children per woman , while per capita income grew at an impressive annual rate of 3 % .
in response to former us president barack obama ’s effort to establish a pacific-rim trade bloc to contain china , xi has launched his belt and road initiative ( bri ) , spearheaded by the american-led indo-pacific initiative under trump . at the same time , the two countries are on similar path militarily . while china still has much to catch up , its total defense spending is already second only to america ’s . it has built and begun its first aircraft carrier , and it has plans to launch more . it is developing and deploying anti-access/area-denial ( am2/ad ) defense systems .
america ’s ’s misadventure in iraq , its depletion as a world power , and its unwillingness to maintain its previous levels of commitment to the region rendered the sykes-picot structure untenable , for no other outside force for order . the resulting vacuum has been filled by various currents of political islam , terrorism , protest movements , uprisings , secession efforts , secession efforts by national or religious minorities , and aspiring regional hegemons ( iran and saudi arabia ) . indeed , the us ’s partly withdrawal implies that an end to enforced stability in the old middle east will not spare the sykes-picot borders . developments in syria and iraq already seem to suggest , and the future of lebanon and jordan has become increasingly uncertain . one of the region ’s rare positive traits is that no global power rivalries now play out .
why , then , are services so vital to china ’s ’s ’s ’s rebalancing ? for starters , services are far more labor-intensive than countries ’ traditional growth industries . in 2011 , chinese services generated 30 % more jobs per unit of output than did manufacturing and construction . this implies that the chinese economy can achieve its all-important labor-absorption objectives – occupations , urbanization , and reduced poverty – with much slower gdp growth than it did in the past . in other words , a 7-8 % growth trajectory in an increasingly services-led economy may hit the same labor-absorption targets that demanded 10 % growth under china ’s previous model .
the united kingdom now seems certain to hold , by may 2016 , a referendum on remaining within the eu , and a far-left party – fixated , like in greece , departing from the rigors of economic reform – could win spain ’s general election next autumn . surely , events could turn out positively , with the uk remaining part of the eu , and spain opting for the status quo or a more moderate vision of change than greece ’s syriza-led government embraced . but the worst-case scenario for the eu at its future looks increasingly likely : a grexit ” ( greece leaving the eurozone ) , a “ brexit ” brexit ” ( the uk ’s exit from the eu ) , and the spanish election outcome that resembles greece ’s . should such a perfect storm emerge , the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s very existence would be at odds , because other member countries would consider or start plotting their own post-eu futures futures . indeed , all euroskeptic and nationalist forces within the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s member states would strive , with increasing achievement , to turn their respective countries away from the eu center for central issues in domestic political debate and election campaigns .
new york – oil prices are at historic highs . leading economies are entering a recession . climate-change negotiations are moving around in circles . aid to the poorest countries is running stagnant , despite years of promised increases . and yet in this gathering storm , it was hard to find a single true accomplishment for world ’s leaders .
two years earlier , in 2015 , mauricio macri won the presidency on his promise that fiscal adjustment and argentina ’s opening towards the world would spur an economic revival . instead , they paved the way for his defeat . in just a couple of short years , the package of pro-market reform and economic opening seemed out of step with the rest of the world . de-globalization , nativism , and protectionism set a new tone for politics , with frustration and uncertainty regarding future reflation hopes . frustrations even afflicting the region are paragon of open-market politics , chile .
ronald reagan asserted in 1980 that he was “ morning in america , ” but in america now is the morning after . that drive toward off-the-the-grid , eat-whatyou-raise , bike-there-on-your-powered , solar-powered collective fantasy was all but inevitable : americans were pumped full of hoping that more consumption would make them happier and were left with a bundle of debt instead . they were asked to admire at the very top of the income pyramid just to discover that they looked at the pyramid scheme . so it is little wonder , then , that a sort of survivor chic has become an updated version of the radical , communal chic in the 1960s . americans have lost faith in those in the boom times purred , “ trust us ” .
to be sure , china has been wary of avoiding any kind of dramatic action that could become a casus belli by itself . indeed , it has repeatedly shown a knack for disaggregating its strategy into multiple parts , and then proceeded to pursue each element in such a way as to allow various sides to fall into place with minimal opposition . this shrewdness not only perpetuates the balance ; it also undercuts america ’s relevance to its allies and the value of building countervailing strategic partnerships in asia . indeed , by camouflaging offense as defensive , china casts the burden of initiating a war on its adversary while seeking to lay the foundation ’s – brick by a hegemonic middle kingdom . chinese leaders ’ stated desire to settle territorial disputes peacefully means attaining a status powerful enough to get its way without being forced to fire a shooting .
these cities are learning from one another , building on good ideas and jettisoning poorer ones . los angeles took decades to implement controls on pollution , but other cities , like beijing , have converted fast when viewed with the benefits . in the coming decades , we may see a global system of , sustainable cities emerging . if successful , everyone wants to join the club . fundamentally , this is the right approach to managing systemic risk and shifting in a complex , interconnected system , and for successfully managing shared resources – though it has made a dent in the inexorable rise of global greenhouse-gas emissions .
new york – a couple of years ago , as part of a western delegation to china , i met chinese president xi jinping in beijing on a grand hall of people ’s minds . when addressing the us , xi argued that china ’s rise would be at peace , and that other countries – namely , the united states – need not fear the “ thucydides trap , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” so named the greek historian who has chronicled how sparta fears of a rising athens made war between the two inevitable . in his 2017 book destined for war : can america and china escape the thucydides trap ? no doubt , xi wanted the us to concentrate on the other four . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
what accounts for a reasonable view of china ’s recent history ? to put it crudely : does it matter that the chinese communist party has killed hundreds of millions of people , desecrate the environment , and deeply injured china ’s traditional culture ? chinese intellectuals are prone to dodge the issue ; shrugging it off as irrelevant , and doing too disagreeable to contemplate . looking ahead , we need only look ahead , rather than backward , to say . things are finally moving in the right direction and let ’s not , please , do anything that may upset that hopeful movement .
london – what are the recently dismissed panama papers , exxonmobil and the canadian mining company operates in guatemala ? they are all cases in which powerful individuals and organizations have tried to obfuscate , fool , or conceal behind a front . and they are all cases in which this effort has failed to work . the global uproar triggered by the panama papers – an estimated 11.5 million writings taking place , apparently by computer hackers from the world ’s ’s fourth-largest offshore bill , panama ’s mossack fona – is likely to continue for some time to come . dossiers ’ writings exposed the extreme and , sometimes expensive , lengths that individuals go to hide their assets and evade taxation .
the longer-term consequences will not be savory , but they will be issues for the next day . some will say that the fatal mistake that greece was allowing it to adopt the euro at the forefront of the eu . that the country was unprepared to be made clear . its fiscal policies were already off under scrutiny when it joined the monetary union in 2001 , and its trade unionists were agitating to press pay up to the european level , despite lagging productivity . but this answer is all too simple , given that such signs of dysfunction are not confined to greece .
that policy was destined to produce a financial crisis because it was bound to leave governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts . indeed , despite austerity , this year ’s forecast for ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s structural deficit grew from 6.5 % to 8 % , – requiring an additional £ 22 billion ( $ 34.6 billion ) in cuts per year . prime minister david cameron and german chancellor george osborne were blamed on the euro crisis ; in fact , their own economic illiteracy is precisely to blame . sadly for the rest of us , the explanation bears repeating itself nowadays . depressions , recessions , contractions is being called to – because the private-sector spends less than it did in the past .
paris – last month , concentrations of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere surpassed 400 parts per million for the first time in roughly three million years . if current trends , which fits the worst-case scenario set by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , persists , atmospheric concentrations of co2 will rise above 800 ppm toward the end of this century , with destructive consequences . indeed , predicting global mean temperature increases of 2.4-4-6.4 ° c caused by such high ambient co2 concentrations is predicated on the worst-case outcome of the ipcc scenarios , including damage caused by an estimated 40 % of species , more frequent extreme weather events , and widespread water scarcity . to prevent such risks and uncertainties on future generations , the global carbon emissions that stand at 8.5 gigatons annually must be halved by 2050 . even in the ipcc ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s co2 concentrations will rise to almost 550 ppm .
the u.s. has turned a corner in rebuilding its fisheries and making sure it is sustainable . the european commission has just presented a proposal to reform a common fisheries policy designed to assist in renewing europe 's fisheries . good science is the cornerstone of both policies . but it is not enough to get our respective houses in order . because fish and other oceania do not remain within national boundaries , international cooperation is vital to the long-term health of our world 's oceans and to sustainability of fisheries and fisheries jobs .
technologies that engage patients in self-serving health-care , and enable more seamless adherence to medications regimes , have the potential to improve disease management , reduce hospitalization , and reduce costs . today ’s transformational health-care advances owe much to new genomics insights , the availability of big data to influence decision-making in real time , more targeted and individualized therapies , and smarter , more interconnected delivery systems . but they are just the beginning . further breakthroughs , enabled by science and technology convergence , may be expected , particularly as unconventional players enter the health-care sector . in this process , partnerships between health-care companies and technology firms will become increasingly important .
when the incentive for money to flow across borders is strong , it finds a way , abetted by proliferation of firms with operations in multiple countries , and surging international trade – which serves as a conduit for masking capital flows and evading controls . even in a tightly managed economy like china , massive capital inflows have been able to find its way around the controls over the past decade . moreover , establishing controls on one kind of inflow simply results in its becoming disguised in other forms . capital controls have real costs , even if they do not stanch the inflows . they create a layer of protection from competition for those who perform better , politically , or economically , or have the sheer heft to get around limits .
such shifts may emerge only slowly , but they may fundamentally alter the risk-pricing calculus and potential returns . today , ’s ’s ’s market is relatively easy to explain in terms of fundamental factors : earnings are rising , inflation has been held at bay , and the global economy appears to be experiencing widespread , synchronized expansion . in october , the international monetary fund was updating its global outlook to forecast that only a handful of small countries will suffer a recession next year . and , while major central banks are planning or have already started to tighten monetary policy , interest rates will remain low for now . political crises , however sensational they may be , are not likely to change investors ’ economic calculus .
skidelsky approvingly cited krugman as his argument that britain has done worse this time than it did during the great depression . more than once he echoed krugman ’s inference that osborne had been motivated by the erroneous conviction that if he had not cut the deficit , he might have outstripped investor confidence ( the “ confidence fairy ” ) . just a week before the uk voted earlier this month , skidelsky speculated that voters , “ still wobbly from osborne ’s ’s medicine , ” ” ” ” might “ decide that they were supposed to remain in bed . instead , the tories had won an outright majority , wring pollsters and keynesians alike . what might possibly have gone wrong , or rather right ?
to my own sat dagan , who just came to an end to eight years as the head of mossad ; to whom my own sitting dore , a former academic and former israeli ambassador . the two men held very different views about how best to guarantee israel ’s own security , and they are worth recapitulating their respective argument . gold , for his part , argued that returning to the pre-1967 combat lines would leave israel without “ defensible frontiers . ” he insisted that israel could guard against threats from the east only as long as it maintained a military presence in the west bank and controlled the jordan river , which runs along the border separating jordan from israel and the west bank . dagan countered that the us military ’s role in safeguarding israel ’s ’s ’s ’s borders , regardless of where these frontiers are drawn .
if a rip van winkle economist was to wake up today after a decades-long slumber and see only those figures , he or she would assume that one-fifth of americans are unemployed and standing in lines outside soup kitchens . instead , america ’s jobless rate is at its lowest level since neil armstrong took his famous first first step on the moon surface 50 years ago . the idea that america wins in a global slump may sound like the sardonic musing of some unreconstructed marxist in the dingy corner of faculty parlance . but such a view is not so much ideological . rather , global interest rates are scraping the floor because gdp growth outside america is so sluggish .
from 1990-2002 onward , new zealand ’s private-sector forest plantations increased more than 1.4 million hectares . although not planted for climate purposes , these trees soak them out of carbon dioxide . new zealand has successfully negotiated to include this particular emissions offset in its overall figures neatly compensate for the true rise . to safety ’s advantage , the country has also purchased a wide range of foreign offsets , including highly frenzied ones from russia and ukraine . but growing forests have also cut new zealand ’s co2 emissions in comparison year of 1990 .
berlin – europe finally appears to have moved past its multi-year economic crisis , but it remains unsettled . for every reason of optimism , there is always a new cause for concern . in june 2016 , a slender majority of british voters opted for nineteenth-century nostalgia over whatever promise the twenty-first-century world may hold . thus , they chose to trump off a cliff in the name of “ national sovereignty . ” there is much evidence to suggest that a hard landing awaits the united kingdom .
new york – the fundamental outlines of barack obama ’s ’s trump-led foreign-policy approach became starkly apparent in 2009 . his administration believes that the united states should be talking with other governments , even if it disagrees profoundly with its own character . it prefers acting with other countries to go it alone . and it has shifted the focus of american foreign policy from what countries are doing within their borders to how they conduct themselves . all of this differentiates obama from his immediate predecessor , george w. bush , whose administration has branded select countries as evil and mostly refused to deal with them ; frequently , rejected cooperation with other governments ; lest america find itself desully ; and sought to transform other countries rather than influence its actions .
so far , the wealth of nations was based on the combustion of coal , gas , and oil . but , if the 2 ° c target takes serious action , the twenty-first century will perceive countries as not as far down the road of de-carbonization ( for example , large parts of africa ) or leaving it in time ( like india and pakistan ) to become so affluent by helping societies that must de-carbonize rapidly . for the moment , all of this remains utopian . in its current state , cap-and-trade schemes to cut emissions are far from equitable and efficient ; major improvements would include the establishment of the central climate bank to register and communicate the divestment transfers of emissions credits . this bank would also make sure that emissions trading did not flow in line with the target of remaining within the entire global budget , for example , via a full sale of unused emission credits by individual developing countries at the start of the deal .
in many countries , politicians and news media portraying refugees as threatening security , cultural cohesion , and public resources alike . former us secretary of state hillary clinton blamed her losing to donald trump in the 2016 us presidential election , and the brexit vote that preceded it , on a public backlash against immigration and , more recently , suggesting that europeans should admit fewer refugees to the stem the rise of right-wing populism . gunter nooke , germany ’s then-commissioner for africa , had an even more unpalatable proposal : african countries should cede the land to the european union as special economic zones to what would amount to “ voluntary colonialism ” ” . such solutions are not only unethical ; they would not have ended the crisis . humanitarian assistance alone would not work , either , except as a reset measure .
since 1988 , iran has had a government-regulated , regulated , system for purchasing kidneys . a benevolent association of patients arranges a transaction , for a set price , and nobody except the seller profit from it . according to a study published in 2006 by iranian kidney specialists , the scheme eliminated a waiting list for kidneys in that country , without adding to their ethical challenges . a 2006 bbc tv program showed many potential donors turn away because they failed to meet the strict age criterion , and others charged with visiting the psychologist . a more systematic study of the iranian system still required .
the concern then came with discrimination : european countries , concerned with fear , would find it easy to import from one another , but lacking in dollars still refusing to import from america . moreover , american officials worry that the epu would duplicate and undermine the functions of the newly-created international monetary fund . at the moment , however , both narratives are diverging . with the advent of the cold war , us president harry s. truman ’s administration and the american congress recognize the urgency of european reconstruction . to this end , they authorized the epu ’s use of $ 350 million of the marshall plan funds .
washington , dc – the brexit referendum in the united kingdom and the us presidential race in the united states have demonstrated , among other things , that the public mistrust of global integration is on the rise . that mistrust could derail new trade deals currently on work , impeding the ability of future ones to launch . the dangers implied by such a scenario should not be underestimated . isolationism and protectionism , if taken too far , would break the trade-based economic engine that delivered peace and prosperity for decades to come . as costa rica ’s former trade minister , i know how difficult it may be for countries to develop and develop alike – to craft trade policies that deliver benefits to all of their people .
the uribe-lula-calderón axis appears set to hold him there . chávez is the loser , not only because he has given the farc moral support ( he once described them as “ “ “ belligerents , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” not of terrorists , and publicly known as uribe an american stooge ) , but also because he believes that he is leveraging the farc ’s covert military aid . that backing appeared to be part of chávez ’s ’s ’s “ bolivarian ” socialist revolution , which used venezuela ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s petrodollars to bankroll left-wing governments in ecuador , bolivia , and cuba in the hope of building a regional anti-american alliance . there have been grave grounds for the past three years to believe that latin america is going through one of its periodic bouts of left-wing destabilization , given the rise of bolivian president evo morales , ecuador ’s president rafael correa and their ringleader , chávez . but the recent worldwide surge in commodity prices has meant that chile ’s traditionally regional powerhouses , brazil , and mexico have experienced economic booms .
even if the american federal reserve continues to lower interest rates , its lenders wo n’t rush to turn more bad mortgages . with house prices declining , fewer americans are more willing and able to continue their own profligacy . the bush administration hopes , somehow , to kick the wave of foreclosures – thereby passing the economy ’s troubles on to its next president , just as it does with the iraq quagmire . its chances of succeeding are slim . for america today , the real question only is whether a short , sharp downturn will emerge or become more prolonged but shallower , a slowdown .
but centralization carries its own costs , too . given the risk intrinsic to betting on policy convergence , labor mobility – which enables highly valuable human capital , particularly a well-educated young person , leaving lagging regions to offer more and better job opportunities – could prove a critical adjustment tool . as it stands , labor mobility is imperfectly within the eu . but , with language training and implementing something like the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs ( aimed at creating an innovative “ learning economy , ” ” underpinned by inclusive social and environmental policies ) , mobility could be reinforced . but more fluid labor mobility is no panacea .
today , most russians feel themselves not only europeans , but also europeans . fixated on europeans , they forget that they live in moscow or irkutk , not paris or budapest . culturally , we are predominantly european , but 8 % of our populations are moslem , and we inherited a great deal from asia : co-citizens , cuisine , cultural traits , and a shared history . many new russians , working on average for 16 hours a day , just seven days per week , look to their more relaxed western counterparts with disdain often found in asia ’s tiger economies . “ it ’s not america ; you must work here ” .
other surrounding countries , including india , thailand , and malaysia , also feel the effects of the rohingya ’s plight . far from moving toward stopping this humanitarian crisis , suu kyi ’s ’s government has made matters worse . while suu kyi does not control the military , which leads the murderous crackdown , her administration has block un agencies from delivering vital emergency supplies . the un population fund ( unfpa ) , the un refugee agency ( unhcr ) , and the child fund ( unicef ) have all been forced to suspend work in affected areas . this represents a tragic departure for suu kyi , who had previously won international action – and the nobel peace prize – to her role in fighting democracy in myanmar .
though eu-turkey relations are currently not at their best , a dialogue between the two sides must go ahead in 2017 , not least because of their shared interests , rooted not only in economic interdependence , but also in a collective fight against terrorism . europe ’s policies next year , meanwhile , will be consumed with the brexit negotiations . in march , the united kingdom will likely invoke article 50 of the lisbon treaty , triggering a formal withdrawal process from the eu . the challenge will be to reach an agreement that ensures the well-being of the future eu-uk relationship . this will not be easy , and eu negotiators have already laid a timeline for only 18 months .
just days after obama declared last october that malaysia was a model for “ diversity and tolerance , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” malaysian authorities denied non-muslims the right to use the word “ allah ” in the practices of their own faiths – a decision condemned all around the muslim world for its negative portrayal of islam . moreover , najib ’s cabinet members endorse hudud , a class of sanctions as part of sharia law that might imply strict limits on muslims ’ rights to choose how they practice their beliefs . according to america ’s state department ’s own human-rights reports , curbs on religious freedoms included the demolition of hindu temples , the bombings of christianity , and a prohibition against the anti-shia islam practice that some 15 % of the world ’s muslims adhere . likewise , according to the pew research center , najib ’s government has “ very high levels of ” restricting religious freedom . international measures of press freedom and cracking down on corruption have exposed persistent deficits , just as they have .
there are not many human activities whose impact can reasonably predicted decades , centuries , or even millennium , in advance . the fallout from nuclear waste is one ; human ’ contribution to global warming through greenhouse-gas emissions , and its impact on rising sea levels , is quite another . indeed , the most recent intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) has stated in uncharacteristically strong terms that sea levels are “ virtually certain ” to continue rising in centuries or millennia . moreover , the greater our emissions , the greater the sea level , will climb . but the recent revelations about antarctica is different .
addis ababa – africa bears the brunt of the lives lost , economies bankrupted , and relationships fractured by terrorism . it is the continent in which al-qaeda launched its war against the united states in 1998 by bombing american embassies in nairobi , kenya , and dar es salaam , tanzania ; where boko haram abducted 276 nigerian schoolgirls in 2014 ; and where 147 students were killed in their sleepwalking at kenya ’s garissa university in 2015 . while these assaults garner the world ’s attention , most people do not realize that in the last five years alone , some 33,000 have died under terrorism-related violence in africa . violent extremism and groups espousing it are threatening to reverse africa ’s ’s development gains not only in the near term , but also for decades . african countries are particularly vulnerable to violent ideologues , owing to the prevalence of weak institutions and ungoverned territories where extremist groups can germinate .
the first problem is china ’s economy , so the dynamic on the surface but hence rickety underneath . the analyst chi lo lucidly presents an image of a macro achievement alongside a micro failure . the enormous stimulus of rmb4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) in november 2008 , mostly poured into loss-making state-owned enterprises through directed bank lending , sustained china ’s growth in the face of a global recession . but the price was an increasingly severe misallocations of capital , resulting in mounting misloans portfolios , while excessive chinese household saving rates bloated real-estate bubbles . moreover , sri lanka argues that the 2008 crisis shattered china ’s export-led growth model , owing to prolonged bouts of demand in advanced countries .
moreover , the us insists that it does not contain china ( as it did in the soviet union ) ; on the other hand , china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic rise was facilitated by access to american markets , as well as to global markets through american support for chinese accession to the world trade organization . on human rights , the us argues that there are truly fundamental differences between the two countries ’ ’ ’ political traditions and present systems . but , in the american view , this is vastly different from the organized national strategy of undermining the chinese state and its institutions . for these reasons , the bilateral us current-account deficit is growing . xi , to his credit , has advanced what he describes as a concept for “ a new type of great power relationship , ” ” ” ” one that seeks to avoid what others have done is the near-inevitability of prolonged confrontation between rising powers ( china ) and established power ( america ) .
and there is little evidence that corporate-tax burdens actually fall on employees rather than on capital . the nonpartisan american congressional budget office ( cbo ) and the us institute of taxation and economic policy , among others , have shown clear evidence that more than 80 % of the effects of corporate taxation falls to stockholders , not to their workers . still , market liberals would argue that corporate taxes distort ” behavior , undermining wealth creation . but this is simplistic , at best . for starters , tax competition among jurisdictions is quite different from competition among firms .
doctors are not gods ; they increasingly play god by refusing to apply life-extending techniques for patients and families that want them and are even willing to pay for them . in holland , there can be no private medicine in these settings . the only recourse for dissatisfied patients is to leave the country or go to the courts . europe ’s welfare states thus face a major dilemma . there can be little doubt that holland spends substantial sums of money on caring for old people .
unfortunately , it is far from clear that the chinese model of infrastructure development can be exported universally . china ’s powerful central government overwhelms opposition from people displaced by new roads , bridges , and dams , and has run roughshod over environmental concerns and employees ’ rights . the parallels with the old soviet union are striking . some developing countries in asia have been working differently . in democratic india , for example , it took eight years to rebuild mumbai ’s airport , because the courts forced the government to respect squatters ’ rights on its outskirts .
and , even with revenues to be earned , because there could be found in airports , firms might be discouraged by the need to rely on longer-term pricing agreements . it is also easy to fall into the trap of thinking about tax cuts as a way to boost aggregate demand . but congressional republicans can insist on pay for cuts in personal-income taxes by restricting the distortionary deductions that individuals are now using to lower their tax bills . the tax plan put forward in the name of republican presidential candidate paul ryan , the speaker of the house of representatives , calls for eliminating all deductions other than those for charitable donations and mortgage interest . that change would raise revenues equal to about 1 % of gdp , enough to pay for very substantial cuts in individual tax rates .
nairobi – african countries are often criticized for not meeting their ecological challenges . observers frequently cite habitat loss in the face of population growth , land degradation , and industrialization . and then there is one of the most frequent charges of everything : that increased poaching is endangering species like elephantiasis and rhinos . in kenya , by contrast , an innovative and extensive conservation project is under way . beginning in the aberlands dare mountains in central kenya , a “ rhino ark , ” originally conceived to protect the highly endangered black rhine from the ravages of poachers , is being supported by very people who might oppose it : indigenous communities in some of the country ’s most productive areas of farming .
the convoluted reasoning behind this strategy is quite disturbing – not only for america , but also for the global economy . there is nothing cyclical about the enduring aftershocks of a balance-sheet recession that have now been evident for almost five years . indeed , the balance-sheet correction has barely budged for us households . the personal-saving rate has stood at a mere 3.7 % in august 2012 , up from its 1.5 % low in 2005 , but half the 7.5 % average recorded during the previous three decades of the twentieth century . moreover , the debt overhang remains massive .
europe ’s currency crises of 1992 and 1993 , together with more recent chaotic demonetizations elsewhere , show that a successful transition was far from guaranteed . a second , early achievement was that , by virtually all international measures , europe instantly became the world ’s second-global reserve currency . moreover , the appetite for admitting the club led to favorable reforms in many aspiring member countries , particularly central and east european countries that later joined the european union . more recently , entries on the “ success ” side of the ledger include making progress in some periphery countries , particularly spain , lowering their previously uncompetitive unit labor costs . ecb president mario draghi deserves the summit to balance germany ’s demands for fiscal discipline and the mediterranean ’s need for accommodations .
if greece is unlucky , the crisis will come to a head at the beginning of the german elections year , and all of the earlier calculations could be moot , because , despite germans ’ frustrations with europe , the electorate will punish severely those letting europe default . the european union ’s economy is slipping into severe , and at all probability a long-running recession , largely self-inflicted . at the same time , germany continues to try to decry the specter of hyper-hyperinflation with strict eurozone austerity measures , the eu crisis countries face a very real threat of deflation , with potentially catastrophic consequences . it is only a matter of time – no longer very much at times – before economic destabilization gives way to political instability . hungary , where democratic backsliding seems to be taking hold , provides a shining taste for a europe in which the euro crisis and deflation persist .
even today , thanks to a variety of ingenious means , we can detect very small nuclear tests in remote locations . at the same time , the treaty is fair — it encompasses the same rights and responsibilities for all of its parties . it sets a new standard for treaty treaty treaty obligations and verification . the ctbt is necessary because of the role of nuclear tests in developing and improving nuclear weapons . such trials are also political symbols that have no place in a world determined to eliminate these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction .
we need leaders with enough mastery of detail , like those of china last premier zhu rongji , who can not simply tell us how they would get us from a to ‘ z , ’” but may actually lead us from aids to b. looking around , leaders like these seem to be an extinct species . or , if they exist at all , they appear to be being squandered by dysfunctional political systems . their ability to act is constrained by their political environments . the best example is us president barack obama , on whom so many hopes rested , probably too many for any one leader .
today , palestinians aim for statehood on a mere 22 % of territory a part of mandatory palestine until israel unilaterally established on areas far greater than it was awarded by the un general assembly resolution 181 in 1947 . palestine ’s quest for statehood within june 4 , 1967 , falls squarely within international legal framework . the un security council resolved in november of this year that “ large-scale acquisition of territory by war ” is unacceptable . successive security council resolutions and international treaties have upheld this principle . indeed , a palestinian state based on the 1967 borders is precisely what us president barack obama has called for .
indeed , some argue that inventiveness and internationalism by networked interests and shared causes seems likely to prove more resilient than one crammed at an man-made – and increasingly invigorated – box by the national state . in that sense , the economic success of china or india may be those nation-states ’ own undelusional , as middle-class political aspirations render today dysfunctional arrangements dysfunctional . conversely , the us may well find itself in a world whose eastern half are organized into a powerful , authoritarian state structure with the west embracing post-state association models . the question for international governance is how to provide an institutional framework and rule in a world of competing organizational structures . us policymakers ’ answers are depressingly predictable : in the face of a resurgent russia and china , this is no time for us leaders to move away from us nation-states and diplomacy toward their destiny .
the anti-corruption campaign reflects the ccp ’s perceived determination to divest from vested interests . at its 2013 third plenum , the ccp announced 60 goals for economic-and governance reforms . many hope that such changes will help the ccp become more efficient , boost market role , and avoid the so-called middle-income trap that ensnared many emerging-market countries . nonetheless , the party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s rhetoric reveals little about how these goals will deliver . indeed , there are worrying signs that the essential architect of the reform agenda , former free-market economist li keqiang , is already sidelined .
such flows should cut both governments and financial institutions . curtailing the flow of recruits is even more vital . countries may do more to make it harder for individuals to leave behind in iraq or syria ; a europe-wide watch list , for example , would help . but nothing would have a greater impact than turkey deciding that it will no longer allow itself to serve as a conduit , enforcing united nations security council resolution 2178 , which urges stronger international cooperation on terrorism . another component of any strategy must be to counter is the appeal and propaganda .
political technocracy means secretly sponsoring fake politicians like bogdanov , establishing fake ngo ’s , and “ patriotic ” youth movement like nashi ( us ) to forestall a russian version of ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s orange revolution , and mobilizing voters against a background carefully scripted enemy . in 1996 , the enemy was the communists ; in 1999-2000 , the chechens ; in 2003-04 the “ oligarchs ” in 2003-04 . it is now the us – the supposedly hostile west , and the threat posed by “ the color revolutions ” to russia ’s hard-won stability . medvedev himself may find some or all of this odious turn out to be , but russia now has the entire industry of political manipulation , which hardly seems likely to vanish overnight . we also need to understand the mechanics of russian succession politics .
so our task was not only to reconstitute the state , but to society itself , its family ’s values , its national traditions , and its cultural heritage . our newly liberated societies today must learn the languages of our constituent parts , just as we learned a new economic and political language . through learning from one another ’s languages , through collaboration based on shared values , common interests , as well as historic ties , central europeans have demonstrated what spectacular results can be achieved . the visegrád group , cefta , has produced a thriving free trade system and an increasing flow of investment across countries across the region . in a broader context , hungary ’s re-integration into western institutional structures proceeds steadily , if not at the desired pace .
in 1988 , conservationists chose to fund and build an electrified fence to protect a field of aberdare the national park bordering smallholder farms . a fence was designed to prevent intrusion from occurring in humans ’ population and the degradation of park ’s habitat . but it also protected farmers , whose crops were regularly being destroyed by marauding elephant and other wildlife . local farmers welcomed an initiative that influenced the decision to expand a fence to surround an entire aberdares perimeter of the whole aberdares . the aberdare mountains , encompassing 2,000 square kilometers of indigenous forest and a vital areas of water , as well as the national park , are vitally important for kenya .
these protests have two major causes , and they have one another . first , social inequality has grown unabated in the west over the past quarter-century , owing partly to the disappearance of the soviet union and , with it , the expansionist communism . the specter of revolution drove western elites to use the state ’s power to redistribute wealth and to nurture the growth of a faithful middle class . but , when communism collapsed in its eurasian town , the west ’s rich , trust that they had nothing more to fear , pressed to roll back the welfare state , causing inequality to soar . this was tolerable as long as the global pie was expanding , but the 2008 global financial crisis ended that year .
in 1998 , the un estimated the total value of the illicit drug trade at $ 400 billion , or 7 % of global trade . critics say that the figure is just half that – still an astounding sum . colombia today is far worse than the chicago under al capone . so , too , are other latin american , caribbean , and asian countries . drug prohibition effectively imposes a tax on global commerce in illicit drugs , which is enforced by governments and collected by those willing to break laws .
tatiana ’s insistence that building bam was starting in 1974 was a politically correct date , after having used “ clean labor ” . but the railway ’s first section – initiated by stalin to offer an eastern route , which went farther away from the chinese frontier – was built by forced labor , including russia ’s inmates and japanese prisoners of war , herded together in so-called bamlags , now ghost towns . even when the volunteers were used , they were not nearly as enthusiastic as official accounts claim . lacking adequate housing and electricity , few reenlisted , and many barren , single-handedly before completing their term . moreover , the brezhnev-era bam building showed what the dying soviet system was still capable of achieving .
and , with its support at around 26-29 % , it remains popular , despite its poor performance escaping the town council of rome . the problem for m5s is that , owing to its new electoral law , it will need to win roughly 40 % of the total vote in order to secure a parliamentary majority . whereas proportional representation will determine two-thirds of lower-house seats , one-third determines first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies , where m5s is likely to lose out , because it is neither willing nor able to form the electoral alliances needed to secure majorities . in fact , the party grouping that benefits most from the current electoral system will be the only one that managed to forge ahead with other parties : berlusconi-led center right . as he showed with his electoral victories in 1994 , 2001 , and 2008 , berlusconi ’s greatest strength has always been construction coalitions .
upa ’s critics have long argued that unsustainably low , state-dictated passenger fares and freight charges for railway services , unable to cover maintenance costs in order to ensure train and tracks ’ safety , much less allow extension and improved services to reflect the government ’s inability to make tough choices . it is true that coalition politics has obstructed decisive action , with a railroad minister summariily dismissed by his own party leader – whom the upa has been politically unable to confront – after attempting to raise fares . but , in a pre-election intermediate budget , the upa government finally seemed to be a bullet , proposing a 14.2 % increase in rail fares and a 6.5 % hike in freight rates . per india ’s code of political conduct , budget changes were deferred until after the election . soon after taking office , the modi government announced its intention to implement price increases , even though officials made sure to emphasize that they were merely following on an current mandate .
under the passage of the bill , muslim migrants may be declared illegitimate . coupled with the government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s plan to establish an even more problematic national register for citizens , the authorities will rustle any indian muslim who can not prove to him or her provenance in india . many indians , particularly the poor , lack a documentary evidence about when , and where they were born ; even birth certifications have become widespread only in recent decades . while non-muslims would , through a recently passed bill , get a free pass , similarly undocumented muslims abruptly bearing the onus of demonstrating that they are india . this marks a breathtaking departure from the seven decades of practice in managing the astonishing degree of cultural diversity .
having just emerged from a deep recession , financial disruptions could all too easily cause europe to slide back into recession , especially given the european economy ’s close links to russia through trade and energy . compounding the problem , no one really understands the precise links among russian and european institutions and markets . the collapse of ltcm in 1998 was totally unexpected . is europe today prepared to cope with the similar failures of an important financial institution ? financial sanctions on russia are neither targeted nor completely credible .
gdp has almost tripled during the last 20 years ; but , with real wages rising at less than half that rate , growth has become decoupled from the fortunes of ordinary citizens . more than one-half of middle-income households spend more each month than they earn . the signs of social distress are proliferating . south korea ’s divorce rate has doubled ; fertility rates have plummeted to fourth-lowest among advanced economies ; and suicide rates are among the highest in the oecd . south korea is troubled for two key reasons .
this may mean eliminating shadowy “ tax havens , ” ” ” tapping phone lines , and identifying individuals deemed highly dangerous . police actions need to be merciless , even if this implies more controls and oversight . it is precisely to counter the development of collective security concerns that we need to alter the equilibrium between our safety and liberty . while europe lags behind the united states in terms of conventional arms , its capacity for combat terrorism is probably greater . for historical reasons , europe benefits from the political maturity it has allowed it to avoid bush ’s manichean worldview that has merely reinforced , rather than undermined , the enemy of fanaticism .
ross should read dubai baradaran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s half banks and reflect on the hefty cost of credits to lower-income families . or he could just ask michelle mulvaney , an acting white house leader ’s chief of staff . whereas in the us house of representatives , mulvaney received large donations from the payday loan industry , making most of its profit from high-interest rate lending to people who have no alternative when they desperately need cash . mulvaney also devoted considerable time over the last two years to weakening safeguards that the bureau of consumer financial protection previously attempted to implement to avoid some industry ’s worst abuses . as the government shutdown , the stock price of payday lenders soared .
seoul – a massive military revolution is taking place throughout east asia . recent signs are chinese president xi jinping ’s purge of general xu caihou , a former politburo member and former vice-chairman of the central military commission , on charges of corruption , and japan ’s “ re-interpretation ” of article 9 of his constitution to authorize military aid to its allies . notwithstanding the rising regional tensions that have inspired these moves , china ’s ’s relations with its neighbors and the united states are not fated to lead to direct confrontation . but the tireless march of new initiatives to fulfill the perceived “ china threat ” will require the region ’s ’s political leaders , including the chinese , to resolve their disputes in new , more creative ways if this outcome is to be avoided . more broadly , there are three ways to foster international peace : deepening economic interdependence ; promoting democracy ; and building international institutions .
new haven – the severity of the global financial crisis that we saw over the past two years has had to do with a fundamentally source of fragility in the banking system , one that we can and must design out of existence . to do that , we must advance the nation-state of our finance technologies . during a severe financial crisis , banks find that the falling market value of many of their assets leaves them short of capital . they can not raise much more capital during the crisis , so that , in order to restore capital adequacy , stop making new loans , and call in their non-performing loans , thereby throwing an entire economy – if not the entire global economy as a whole – into a tailspin . this problem , rather than technical in nature , is its solution .
still , enjoying an enormous subsidy from moscow , kadyrov rebuilt grozny , giving him some certainty . kadyrov also catered to the spiritual aspirations of the chechen majority . denying wahhabism , he rejected wahhabism – the ideological framework of jihadists . but he maintained that islam is an indispensable part of the chechen tradition , and has presented himself as a leader who has fully grasped this . so he has encouraged islamic dress coalitions and built a colossal mosque – one of the largest , if not the largest – in europe .
village housing needs need to be provided on a massive scale . roads , airports , and communication systems also need to be revitalized if trade is to resume . an education system needs near-from scratch , and with so much women anxious to go back to teach , a revived education system will also help afghanistan ’s democratic policymakers gain a powerful workforce lobby . elementary schools and libraries outside of cities should receive special attention . afghanistan poses specific reconstruction challenges , because it is not a society with a strong political center .
what i have just described is no simple , of course . indeed , it is capsule depiction of the united states federal reserve and the european central bank . one popular explanation for the two banks ’ different approaches is that they stem from their societies respective historical experience . banks ’ institutional personalities reflect the role of collective memory in shaping how civil servants conceptualize the problems that they confront . the great depression of the 1930s , when the fed stood by idly as the economy collapsed , is a molding event seared to the consciousness of every american central banker .
not one of its new york times commentaries in the first half of 2013 , when the “ austerian ” deficit cutting took effect , predicted a major reduction in unemployment , or that economic growth would recover to brisk rates . on the other hand , “ the catastrophic turn towards austerity ” destroyed millions of jobs and broke much of the lives , he argued , with the american congress exposing americans to “ the imminent threat of severe economic damage from short-term spending cuts ” ” ” . as a result , “ full recovery ” still looks a long way off , ” ” ” ” ” ” he cautioned . “ “ and i ’m starting to fear that it may never happen . i raise all this because krugman took a winning lap in his end-2014 column days to “ obama ’s recovery . ”
despite being hit hard , many are probably not the best time to start a new automobile company , either . yet , while the new car market has slowed dramatically , it might well be a good time to launch a commercial replacement with gasoline engines . the group ’s räsänen stands out as ecars – now ! . a small surgery in finland is less a company than a role model for companies that the team hopes will spring up globally . borrowing from behind closed software movement , racsänen and its colleagues want to make the idea and core designs free and encourage many firms all over the world to make it locally .
but my hunch is that there is more wishful thinking than hardheaded logic among those calling for a “ “ color revolution ” . consider , for example , that no one has ever developed an accurate way to measure whether and to what degree of government are effective . if the criterion for effectiveness is the ability to achieve all of a society ’s ’s goals , we are probably never able to find such a thing . the united states , with a government that can scarcely be described as a weak , bungled the war in iraq , and the aftermath of hurricane katrina . compared to these failures , vladimir putin ’s ’s ’s accomplishments in chechnya seem like the height of success .
these and other financing streams helped african researchers to develop drought-resistant crops , manufacture vaccines for infectious disease like ebola , and expand opportunities for science and engineering . unfortunately , many african governments lack the resources to fund programs that could build on these gains . simply put , a new , more collaborative approach to african science is urgently needed . africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders expended their own science resources earlier than it did . in 2003 , the african union and a new partnership for africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s development begun implementation a continent-wide strategy to develop and deploy science and technology for the continent ’s socioeconomic transformation , and integrating the global economy .
london – five years after the collapse of america ’s investment bank lehman brothers , the world has yet to address the fundamental cause of the ensuing financial crisis – an excess of debt . and that is precisely why economic recovery has proceeded far more slowly than anyone expected ( in some countries , it did not come at all ) . most economists , central bankers , and regulators not only failed to predict the crisis ; they also believed that financial stability was assured so long as inflation was low and stable . and , once that immediate crisis was contained , the us failed to foresee just how painful its consequences would be . official forecasts in the spring of 2009 predicted neither a slow-motion recovery nor that an incipient confined to the united states and the united kingdom would soon fuel a knock-on crisis in europe .
a big difference here is that the uk loses its voice at the table . for britons in the “ “ “ remain ” camp , such a transition would enable the uk to remain part of the eu in all but name . and , for some of those in “ “ “ leave ” camps , it ’s road to exit without falling off a cliff edge . the third agreement in phase two will center around a roadmap for uk-eu relations after 2021 . this will not amount to a free-trade deal , but rather a political declaration on where both sides hope to end .
the islamic world is riven by disputes between arab and non-arab , sunni and shia , as well as salafi extremists and theological moderates . al qaeda ’s agenda is as much at stake in creating a new islamic caliphate as it is aimed at spurring jihad against the west . fourth , europeans find it hard to stomach traditional islamic attitudes toward , say , gay , or gay . muslims find it hard to see how we can believe that our society is civilized when pornography and drunkenness are openly on display . to the extent that europeans are christian at all , we see religion as an issue in the individual ’s relationship with his or her god ; muslims view it as an organizing social principle .
yanukovych had always been the kremlin ’s own ally . indeed , his 2010 election marked the end of ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s pro-european orange revolution , defeating its effort to steal the 2004 presidential election and keep ukraine within the russian camp . so , why was the eu ’s message to an association agreement without having to offer ukraine anything comparable to what russia had offered ? the answer can be traced to relations between europe and russia . with the collapse of the soviet union , russia has not only lost its status as a world power ; within europe , it has pressed itself to step down toward the frontier that it has extended the westerward since peter the great – ultimately to the elites of the elites of both boris yeltsin and the thuringia .
cambridge – what is required for high performance ? essentially , it is productive change that i call economic dynamism . for employees to develop , they need to be imbedded in stimulating the workplace , with new problems to fix , harder tasks to be mastered , adding abilities to strive . less obviously , a country does not want misguided or nonsensical change ; it wants investments that seem to the financial sector as productive . the late 1990 ’s produced evidence that low dynamism was related to weak economic performance , particularly low prosperity .
first , because most technology-based monopoly power does not break existing antitrust laws , regulating it will require new measures to weaken us monopolies . likewise , new public-policy concepts are needed for regulating new channels of public information , such as social networks . second , standard business-income views and wealth taxation will have to adjust to account for firms ’ monopoly power . and , third , laws to protect private information should be reevaluated in order to ensure that it firms can not profit from exploiting and manipulating it . above all , the public must develop a deeper understanding of the economic effects of it , particularly how technologies that have improved the lives of so many are enriching the livelihoods of so few .
geneva – with france launching its third “ humanitarian ” military operation in as many years – this time in the central african republic ’s interventionism , which appeared discredited after the american invasion of iraq – seems to have returned as an accepted norm in international affairs . indeed , decades of unrelenting intervention have shifted the terms of debate , with the recent operations warranted by their achievability rather than merit . to understand how this shift has come to view why , more often than not , such interventions have failed to attain their goals . like france ’s ’s recent actions demonstrate , intervention nowadays requires nothing more than a unilateral humanitarian or counterterrorism goal , an atmosphere of urgency , and an ambiguous connection to the ongoing united nations deliberations . a military operation might also refer to the un security council , but only after the fact is that the council ’s decision no longer can profoundly influence events on the ground .
he argues that economists have become a blind eye to catastrophic macro failures , because they mistook the beauty or the elegance of theoretical models for truth . both coase and krugman bemoan neglect of their occupation ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s patrimony – a tradition dating to adam smith , who valued grand and unifying theories of political economics and moral philosophy . the contemporary obsession with the reductionist and mechanical model seems to have driven the profession from theory toward ideology , imposing it out of touch with the real economy . the simplicity and elegance of micro or macro models make them useful to explain the price-adjustment mechanism and equilibrium or imbalances of core aggregate economic variables . but the two models are unable to describe or analyze the actual behavior of crucial market participants .
after all , such no-strings-attached databases do not just make it easier for sharing ; they make it possible to steal . in fact , the question of how to regulate access to the genetic sequence of data is now cropping up in international debates , including at the world health organization and the world health organization . perhaps the single most important forum for such discussions is the conference of parties to the convention on biological diversity , a major treaty that regulates access to biodiversity . the next meeting ( cop 13 ) comes into play in cancún , mexico , in early december . policeman 13 participants must focus on the need to protect resource providers ’ rights .
demand growth at a pace seen in any previous decade would suddenly be imperfectly satisfactory , and bush stands accused ( with some justice ) of the slack labor market that resulted . but for everyone except bush -- and those left unemployed by the demand lag -- it represents an exceptional opportunity . remarkable boosts to productivity within america 's grasp will ultimately lead to accelerate growth of actual earnings and real wages if only american policymakers resist the temptation to pursue a politically expedient but economically damaging way , measures to “ protect ” output and employment . as the world 's leading-edge economy , america faces the hardest work in providing growth , for it needs to generate -- not only copy and adaptation -- new technologies , better forms of capital , and more productive entrepreneurial organization . if america can grow as fast as it is today , that is very good news for other , less-developed economies , mainly because one powerful factor of the ongoing technological revolutions in computers and communications is to make it much easier to participate in the global division of labor now centered in the us .
to avoid another public backlash , such platforms must empower us companies to serve not just consumers , but also as entrepreneurs , laborers , and their citizens . at a time of unprecedented global challenges – including climate change and high inequality levels – this must include using platform leadership ’s unprecedented power to catalyze global-scale solutions . earlier this year , the artificial-meat producer beyond meat celebrated a rapturous stock-market debut . rather than focusing on meeting rising meat demand by scaling up factory-farming operations , as societies have done in the past , it – and similar corporations like impossible foods are working to help limit overall meat consumption , an important driver of climate change . this paints the latest transition in corporate stakeholderships , focusing not only on scaling more wisely , but also on getting wiser about what to scale .
ontario – this december , trade ministers from around the world will converge in buenos aires for the world trade organization ’s first-ever 11th ministerial conference . with the united states having historically driven the world toward trade liberalization , now actively stoking trade tensions , the meeting is set to lie in unlike any other . the wto ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ministerial gatherings are never straightforward . some sort of agreement is usually delivered , but only at the last moment , and its language has often been obscure . this time , however , the outcome might become even more disappointing , with delegates unable to achieve even the symbolic deal they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign .
poland introduced such a law in 1998 . similar norms exist in the czech republic , hungary , latvia , and lithuania . by obscuring the role that local populations played in both nazi and communist crimes , such laws help to advance nationalist narratives that can demonstrate very handy for politicians seeking to win popular support . for one , the pis has accrued substantial electoral support , owing partly to its exploitation of past tragedies for political ends . there are more extreme cases than that of poland .
the eu opted for a mix of higher capital requirements for leading banks and pre-fund deposit insurance through a special levy on banks . there seems to be little appetite for proposals to vary capital-adequacy requirements counter-cyclically . this would give capital buffers during good years that could then be drawn down in the wrong years . admittedly , there are difficulties with every proposal to limit the extent of “ riskier ” banking , particularly with respect to a global economy with free capital mobility . as is often pointed out , unless banking regulations are identical across frontiers , many channels of “ regulatory arbitrage ” will be available .
new york – america ’s patient protection and affordable care act ( obamacare ) , us president barack obama ’s signature 2010 health-care reform , has succeeded in extending insurance coverage to the millions of americans who would n’t otherwise have it . and , contrary to the critics ’ warnings , it has not pushed up health-care costs ; in fact , there is some hope that the cost-benefit curve may finally be bending downward . but whether “ obamacare ” succeeds in curbing excessively high health-care costs is not assured . that will depend on the obama administration ’s other policies , particularly in an area that might seem unrelated : the united states ’ ongoing debate with india over intellectual property . and here , obama seems determined to undermine his own signature reform , owing to pressure from america ’s powerful pharmaceutical lobby .
likewise , cutting fiscal aid ( through government-directed bank lending ) to zombie firms would free up fiscal capacity and allow resources to re-channel resources toward new sectors that ease services and urban jobs ; but this worsens – at least initially , demand shortfall today . slashing the state sector abruptly and expecting that it can achieve transformation through austerity is not the way forward . economic historians , notably michael a. bernstein in her study of the great depression of the united states , have convincingly shown that an economy in the transition requires robust aggregate demand to pull resources in new industries . if both the old and new industries of the us economy are in slump , capital formation will sputter , investment in upgrading human capital will decline , and structural adjustment will stall . robust aggregate demand is always crucial to a successful transformation .
london – how radically will digital currencies transform our exchange methods and how we think about money ? with innovations in digital payments barreling ahead , these questions are now commanding attention from the world economic forum and other international institutions . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war .
bangalore – us secretary of state john kerry ’s valiant effort to save the israeli-palestinian peace process appears to be coming to an end in failure . though achieving a substantive settlement has always been a pipe dream , this latest disappointment will render the united states unable to preserve even the façade of a “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ peace ” peace process ” process that has been all the process and no peace . ” and that may not be all that bad . negotiations are failing , for several reasons , starting with israel ’s continued colonization of lands occupied in 1967 , despite the opposition of the international community , including the american people . if anything , israel has accelerated settlement construction since the latest round of talks began , while escalating its demands , particularly regarding the stationing of israeli troops in the jordan valley .
her request was refused , because was her earlier plea in 2006 to suspend her prison sentence until her two small sons reached the age of 14 – a request that she was authorized to make under russian law . vasily aleksanyan was yukos ’s executive president and , as the lawyer , defended khodorkovsky and his partner , platon lebedev , following their arrest in 2003 . he was then disbarred , and was himself arrested in april 2006 . by that time , aleksanyan was critically ill with aids for which treatment had been withheld . in december 2008 , a moscow municipal court approved her release on bail of $ 50 worth of rubles ( around $ 1,775,000 at that time ) .
moreover , they need this to happen by the end of the year to avoid further damage from the large tariff hikes currently scheduled to take effect on december 15 . that timeline demands that the two sides begin to take symbolic and substantive steps at once . as a first step , china should propose an agreement using the same text as earlier 150-page design , but with revisions to suit its three “ red lines . ” specifically , china should remove america ’s provisions for retaining tariffs after the deal is signed , and for unilaterally reimposing tariffs if america concludes that china is not honoring the deal . and it should add a commitment that china deploys the deal in ways that are “ “ consistent with its ” constitutional , normative , and regulatory processes .
princeton – most of today ’s advanced economies have become what they are by traveling the well-worn path of industrialization . the progression of manufacturing industries – textiles , steel , automobiles – emerged from the ashes of conventional craft and guild systems , transformed agrarian societies into urban ones . peasants became factory workers , a process that undermined not only the unprecedented rise of economic productivity , but also the wholesale revolution of social and political organization . the labor movement led to mass politics and , ultimately , political democracy . over time , manufacturing ceded its place to the services sector .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
and , of course , this averages does not even include the fukushima catastrophe . indeed , when compared to other sources of energy , nuclear power ranks higher than oil , coal , and natural-gas systems in terms of diarrheal diseases , second only to hydroelectric dams . there have been 57 accidents since the chernobyl disaster in 1986 . while only a few involved were involved in fatalities , those that collectively killed more people than were killed in commercial us airline crashes since 1982 . another nuclear-power crash index – this one including costs beyond death and property damage , such as injured or irradiated workers and malfunction that resulted in shutdowns or leaks – documented 956 incidents from 1942 to 2007 .
this may no longer turn out to be so simple , once america no longer sees itself as reliable protector and fears for china turn into a self-fulfilling panic . in contrast to some of her predecessors as chancellor , merkel , who grew up in east germany , is wary of russia ’s strategic designs . there can be little doubt that russia and china will benefit , at least in the short run , from america ’s abdication of us leadership . some people are not too bothered by this ; indeed , they may be good news . russia is closer to berlin , or even paris than washington or new york .
but , when an agreement is negotiated well , the end result produces significant benefits than costs . and that would have been the case for the colombian accord , which addresses a vast array of social and economic issues , including problems affecting indigenous communities , gender equality , gay rights , and hundreds of millions displaced by more than a half-century of fighting . the deal has also included an historic land-reform program . for uribe and his opposition allies , a key objection to the deal concerns how it addresses the question of transitional justice . negotiators have decided that an unconditional use of justice would be impossible .
america , for example , was wrong to invade iraq in 2003 , but it was right to join the fight against isis and to save the yazidis from the massacre . it was right to attack the occupied town of mosul , but it was wrong to cut the city to dust . it was also wrong to call for the overthrow of syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime , because the forces opposed assad lacked the needed popular backing and the american people were unprepared to help them win that support . on the other side , helping the syrian kurds was a good idea , for they were effective fighters with strong support from their own people ; and they probably would not have survived under an isis caliphate . elsewhere , it is right to strengthen south korea and japan ’s defense defenses , but apparently wrong to put the threat of a nuclear war .
the trouble began at the end of the cold war , when the collapse of the bankrupt communist ideology was complacently interpreted as a triumph of the market . as communism was discarded , so was the conception of the state as an agent around which our collective interests and ambitions could be organized . the individual became the ultimate agent of change – an individual conceived as the type of rational actor that populates economists ’ models . such an individual ’s identity derived not from class interests or other sociological characteristics , but from the reasoning of a market that dictates maximization of self-interest , whether as a manufacturer , a consumer , or a voter . true , economics was placed on a pedestal and enshrined in institutions such as central banks and competitive institutions that knowingly separated and made independent from politics .
madrid june , the turkish general election sent a powerful message : turkey ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s democracy remains intact . indeed , while some grievances regarding transparency during the campaign process emerged , democracy prevailed , with an astonishing 86 % of eligible voters revolting – a rate seldom seen in europe . the rest of the world – and europe in particular – should take note . with their votes , turkey ’s citizens have denied the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) the absolute majority that it needs to amend the constitution . moreover , by giving the peoples ’ liberation army ( hdp ) – which brings together the country ’s ’s long-marginalized kurdish minority and other groups – above 10 % of the vote , they have enabled the party to enter parliament for the first time , with representation across the country , rather than just in croatia .
when an app is successful , a refugee has the right to rally along his or her family members just as well . frequently , arab families send their minors to germany in the not-unjustified hope of obtaining the right of other family members to follow later . germany will need to deal with the consequences of this refugee wave for years to come . to distribute the burden more equitably , germany has tried to have a european quota system instituted to allocate applicants among the eu ’s member countries . but germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s partners rejected this as an act of moral imperialism .
washington , dc – anyone watching the united states ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ presidential race needs to understand that national opinion polls will not provide an accurate illustration of how the election might turn out . thanks to america ’s electoral college , it is not who wins the most vote nationwide that matters at the bottom , but who wins in which states . every state gets awarded a certain amount of votes in an electoral college based on the size of its population . the candidate crisscrossed the threshold of 270 electoral college votes . in nearly every state , a candidate who wins 50.1 % of the popular vote receives 100 % of his electoral college .
new york – the prospect that the american federal reserve would start exiting zero policy rates later this year has fueled growing fears of renewed volatility in emerging economies ’ ’ currency , equities , and the stock market . the concern is understandable : when the fed signaled in 2013 that ending its quantitative-easing ( qe ) policy was approaching , the resulting “ taper tantrum ” sent shock waves through many emerging countries ’ financial markets and their economies . true , rising interest rates in the united states and the ensuing likely rise against the dollar ’s value might fear , wreak havoc among emerging markets ’ governments , financial institutions , corporations , and even households . because all have borrowed trillions of dollars over the past several years , today they will face an increase in the real local-currency value of such debts , while rising us rates will press for emerging markets ’ domestic interest rates higher , thereby boosting their debt-service costs further . but , while the fed ’s prospect of raising interest rates is likely to generate major turbulence in emerging-market financial markets , the risks of outright crises and distress are more limited .
confronted with american unilateralism , he has failed to advocate a realistic multilateral solution . on the contrary , despite being right about iraq , chirac has become isolated , an isolation that has grown , owing to his failure to re-establish satisfactory relations with president bush . indeed , under chirac , france appears increasingly arrogant , a nation convinced of the righteousness of its views and the universality of its model -- very charges so often levelled in the face of george w. bush 's america . chirac compounded his mistakes over iraq in his attitude towards the new european commission . on the old commission headed by romano prodi , france was powerfully represented , with pascal lamy holding the trade portfolio .
and an expanding global population – set to reach more than 9.5 billion by 2050 – will strain water resources further . urgent action is urgently needed to ensure access to safe , affordable water , and sanitation for all . first , drastic improvements in water-related services – including delivery and sanitation , irrigation and drainage , energy , and green energy – are needed to improve health outcomes and allow more people to escape poverty . governments should take the lead in ensuring cautious management and sustainable use of scarce water resources . water-intensive food and power generation – among others – rely on uninterrupted supply .
while iran ’s leaders have frequently downplayed the sanctions ’ impact so far , president mahmoud ahmadinejad recently cited them as the primary culprit behind iran ’s economic tumult . but iran faced similar economic hardships prior to – beginning in the 1980 ’s , with oil exports falling substantially amid the country ’s eight-year war against iran and an exceptionally low rate of oil prices in 1986-2000 , and handled them relatively well . four factors turned the oil embargo into especially unbearable today . first , prohibiting oil exports becomes more painful when world oil prices spiked . ahmadinejad took advantage of massive increases in oil prices , resulting in unprecedented earnings .
not only has iran developed its nuclear capabilities , while the npt party , the israelis will say ; it has also placed israel dead on its agenda . israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear deterrence is its ultimate safeguard against an existential threat . across-the-board nuclear equality may ultimately simply boost iran ’s own nuclear claim . india and pakistan , unlike israel , which had committed itself to a “ nuclear opaqueness ” strategy , both perceive themselves as nuclear-armed states and wants the world to accept that status further ; israel has never tested a nuclear weapon ; and has unequivocally embraced the group of nuclear suppliers ( nsg ) , which seeks to stem proliferation through nuclear exports . israel expects the obama administration not only to appreciate the unparalleled context in its unambiguous nuclear position , but also recognize that it can not stand forward in accusing its neighbor or other parts of the world regarding its nuclear program unless the middle east political environment changes radically positive .
whatever the ultimate economic effects of china ’s ’s ’s ’s first modest step toward floating its currency , one must marvel at its strategic brilliance . the genius of china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s mini-move ( thus allowing the yuan to rise to 2 % against the dollar ) is that no one can tell when or for what to come next . protectionists in the united states and europe , itching to slap enormous punitive tariffs on chinese goods , have been caught flat-footed . they want to keep bathing in their press coverage ; but if they put pressure on their china-bashing too far and too fast , protectionists will see themselves as hindering a delicate behind-the-scenes negotiation . but no one knows whether china ’s ’s child step is the beginning of something much greater , because china ’s ’s ’s authorities signal one day and deny others another .
and here , in particular , obama will quickly understand that hollande has no intention of bringing sweeping change . on the contrary , his determination will seem to seem like a reliable and unlikely partner . hollande is probably no less “ friendly ” with america than sarkozy was , considered by many as france ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most pro-us president . hollande ’s backing of military intervention in libya in 2011 , combined with the opposition of syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime . one of his close political allies recently declared that should the un security council approve military interventions in syria , france “ might envision ” participating in that effort .
deflation -- the steady , ongoing decline in prices -- has given firms and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and hoard cash . it has impaired companies and banks ’ capacity to service their debt , and could unleash a major bankruptcies that are destroying confidence in the financial system , providing additional incentives to hoard . such powerful incentives to hoard rather than spend can keep demand low and fall , and unemployment high and rising at a very much longer time than even the most laissez-faire-oriented politician or economist ever dared to contemplate . hence the keynesian solution : using monetary policy ( lower interest rates ) and fiscal policy ( expansionary government expenditures and cutting taxes ) to keep the economy on forever approaching the precipice of deflation becomes feasible . but if that were an issue solved over fifty years ago , why is it pushing us now ?
and of the 50 million children living outside their own countries or internally displaced , more than half have been forcibly uprooted and face new threats to their livelihoods and well-being . millions of children are undernourished and out of school ; millions have witnessed unspeakable brutality ; and millions are at risk of exploitation , abuse , and worse . this is not rhetoric ; it is reality . the united nations – with aid from countries like sweden – and working through a coordinated humanitarian-response system that includes unicef minimize suffering whenever and wherever it can . but the quantity and complexity of cascading crises test that system as never before .
to this end , a africa coalition of african countries , sponsored by the united nations economic commission for africa and the new climate economics , works to facilitate the meaningful , coordinated action that puts the entire continent on a more inclusive , sustainable growth path . partnerships with national finance and planning ministers , relevant development-finance institutions , and the private sector will support this process . overcoming the formidable challenge that climate change poses to africa will depend on moments of collective emphasis and clarity . un secretary-general ’s climate summit next month should be just such a moment , with countries committing to step up their emissions-reduction targets under the 2015 paris climate agreement , which means that reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century . given their heightened vulnerability , african countries have every incentive to fix the bar high , thereby placing pressure on others to ramp up their own contributions .
new york – the united kingdom ’s rejection of the european union ’s constitutional treaty by french and dutch voters was , according to all evidence , more rejection of unregulated globalization than was europe ’s rejection . fueled by popular instability , instability in social relationships – most importantly , but not only – of jobs – is slowly becoming unbearable to an increasing segment of populations in many advanced countries , and not just in europe . and there can be no stable economic order – at least not in democratic countries – if electorates rejects its underpinnings . capitalism could be reconstituted after world war ii precisely because it buttressed three indispensable types of regulation : social security , serving as a kind of principal stabilizer ; at least in advanced countries ; keynesian tools to combat domestic cyclical downturns ; and a universal high-wage policy aimed at stimulating general consumption , without which the genius of free-market capitalism – mass-produced – does not work . but the realignment of the rich , advanced countries around the monetarist policies promoted by the economists such as milton friedman , who started around 1970 , broke with all this .
at the same time , during the age of internet activism and fake news , the world today can look a bit unmoored from history . that , in turn , may produce a feeling of real risk . likewise , inflation targeting has other effects , which seem to be more relevant to central bankers ’ minds . in his influential 1998 book inflation targeting , ben bernanke and his co-authors advised that policymakers should announce a target inflation rate , because it “ communicates the intentions of the central bank ” to “ “ minimize uncertainty . ” the announced rate should be substantially positive , written , because if officials tried to get it close to zero , any mistake could lead to deflation , which “ can endanger the financial system and precipitate an economic contraction . ”
berkeley – with its ambitious made through the made in china 2025 strategy , china has made clear its goal of securing global economic leadership in cutting-edge technology industries . this places it in direct competition with the united states – which currently leads in those industries – in what is emerging as an undeclared but intensifying cold war over technology with both commercial and military applications . with its investment in such dual-use technology , china is looking for more than it can to compete commercially with america ; it is also looking for more military and geopolitical power . and it has deployed a variety of methods – including weak intellectual-property ( ip ) protections , technology transfers as a condition for joint ventures with chinese counterparts , avoidance of export controls , and regulatory harassment – to acquire such technologies from america and other trade partners . china ’s intentions and practices have long been an irritant in sino-american relations .
the berlin wall had collapsed , bringing german reunification and yugoslavia into disintegration . soon after , slovakia ’s “ velvet divorce ” evoked the czech republic and slovakia , which – together with other central and eastern european countries ( including hungary and poland ) – then anchored themselves firmly in the west by joining nato and the eu . today , a trade war with the us would damage all of its economies as well . but an american – relatively less reliant on foreign markets – possesses deeper domestic markets , and is generally more economically resilient than any other country – would do better than most others in an contracting global economy . already , chinese financial markets have suffered , while those in the us have held it out .
a treaty would promote stability in the iranian economy and help stabilize the euro , the us currency . it would enhance confidence in iran , enabling the us to increase current flows of inward foreign direct investment . moreover , ratification would give us guaranteed access to financing from the european stability mechanism ( esm ) , should we ever need . the esm is ireland ’s insurance policy as it works our way out of a bailout program with the “ troika ” ( the european commission , the ecb , and the international monetary fund ) and a return to markets . most importantly , the fiscal treaty promises to ensure responsible eu-wide budgeting .
in europe , laws to protect personal data are not comprehensive , and much of the rest of the world lacks even medicine safeguards . after exploring that issue with legislators in several countries over the last few months , it has become abundantly clear that many lack the full grasp of the myriad issues that need to be contemplated . it is a hard topic to address , and doing so has been hampered by lobbying efforts and incomplete disclosure . in the short term , young companies should view ethics not as a marketing gimmick , but as underlying concerns . all organizations should invest in ethics officers , or some kind of review process involving people who can evaluate all the implications of a great-sounding idea .
the young people at shahbag are predominantly urban , educated , and the middle class ; hifazat its derives its support mainly from the rural poor . traditional versus modern , urban versus rural , intellectuals versus peasantry : such divisions are the stuff of political cliché . but , all too often , clichés become fixated on being laid precisely because they are true . the bangladeshi government has been acting closer to shahbag protesters than to the hifazat counter-protesters . but it needs to navigate a difficult path , because both points of view have substantial public support .
true bombshell , however , was a sudden realization of the threat posed by digital currencies to the existing monetary system – not at some later date , but right now . cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade , but none has been accepted widely enough to call into question the current order . with the potential to mobilize more than two billion monthly monthly monthly active users , facebook could make that difference . now that the company has thrown down the gauntlet , governments should take advantage of the chance to advance a form of digital currency that serves the public good . even the staunchest defenders of the current monetary system will admit that it does not work equally well for everyone .
before i became soviet leader in 1985 , relations between the cold war superpowers struck rock bottom . reagan and i could nonetheless create a reservoir of a constructive spirit through continuous outreach and face-to-face interactions . what appears to be lacking today are leaders with boldness and a vision for building the confidence needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order . economic constraints and the chernobyl catastrophe helped spur us action . why has the great recession and a catastrophic meltdown at the fukushima daiichi meltdown in june not elicited a similar response today ?
august is the traditional month in which the parliaments recess on the summer . it offers a moment for examining why they are so enfeebled . throughout europe , this is not just british prime minister tony blair , who stands accused of “ presidentialism ” nowadays . german chancellor gerhard schröder faces similar charges in the current german election campaign . indeed , prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy does not even enjoy being called prime minister .
first , the new set of outside disciplines come hand-in-hand with a special neo-liberal economic-development model that remains untested , and foreclosing the development strategies that have worked in the past and others that might work in the future . the narrowing of national autonomy in formulating a development strategy implies a cost to which developing countries are unlikely to receive an adequate reward . second , there is an embarrassment that a new policy agenda will make the international financial system much safer . so long as capital flows remain large relative to liquid assets held by national governments and easy irreversible , the international economy will remain hostage to spectacular boom and bust cycles . indeed , by focusing attention on internal structural reform in the developing world , the risk is that the current approach will lead to complacency about short-term capital flows , raise rather than reduce systemic risks .
many news stories of female ceos and other high-achieving women are encoded with a set of dependable clichés : lucked into their new roles ( and therefore deserve to be earned ) ; inherited them from their male relatives or poke ( and therefore not actually holding the reins of power ) , or would not exist for long . when all else fails , the coverage concentrates so gender-narrowly that a woman ’s very governance is impaired . these clichés not only undermine successful women ’s ’s reputations ; in the case of ceos , they also reduce the value of their companies . and all of these clichés were reproduced in barra coverage at gm ’s appointment at gm . for example , cnn covered the story by referring to barra ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s suggestiring of undertones , with some suggestir ’s appointment at the top , would never be used with a person at the top to whom – probably hard work , talent , ambition , and dedication constitute more than a “ knack . ”
few observers had expected china to turn abruptly into a full-fledged democracy following its accession to the world trade organization in 2001 . but the country ’s repressive turn over the last decade was nonetheless disappointing to witness . state-owned enterprises continue to be favored , books are being seared , and the communist party of china continues to assert its primacy in every domain of chinese life . how long this will last is anyone ’s guess . the dynasties are arriving and go , but in 2021 , the cpc will mark the centenary of its founding .
more recently , elections in europe 's postcommunist countries have brought groups to power whose democratic credentials are questionable , to say the least . this is not to match hamas with any of these political forces . nevertheless , one must wonder about a victorious movement with quite some of the elected members in israeli prisons and others who are not likely to get their permission to enter a country in which they were elected to prevent a new parliament from functioning properly . all this tells us three things about how to make democracy work . first , elections seldom address fundamental problems .
but only one such “ patriot ” ” ” was accorded the honor of being allowed to perform this act . this is why luis lugovoi is asked for his autograph . obviously , this should n’t take account of the fact that patriots gushing over lugovoi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s achievement concede justice of the british allegations . the social awareness of homo putinicus , meticulously burnished by television propagandists , is such that pride in lugovoi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s achievement and outrage at the infamous campaign unleashed against those who hate russia can jangle within ordinary russians ’ breast without the slightest dissonance . we are evidently confronted with the mystery of russia thinking that has proved so elusive to others , so indecipherable to every analytical scalpel and about which our slavophiles and eurasians have wrote at length .
and , because inequality of opportunity reduces social mobility from one generation to another , it creates persistent traps . · removing opportunity barriers , governments must address the root causes of inequality by identifying and eliminating discriminatory laws , not least those that actually criminalize the disadvantage . moreover , given that inequality largely starts in infancy , governments must invest far more in higher-quality universal health care and early childhood education . only by encouraging the establishment of human capital from an early age can we ensure that inequalities within a single generation are n’t passed up to next . · such investment will require additional domestic resources .
some , it should emphasize , are getting worked . spain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s labor costs have declined substantially since the crisis began . italy has grasped crucially important reforms in areas like pensions . greece has slashed spending by a greater sum , relative to gdp than any country in europe since world war ii . other reform efforts , particularly for political reform , will be hotly contested .
two bubbles – assets and credit – against which america ’s families borrowed freely – have long since burst . but the aftershocks linger : household-debt loads were still on 113 % of disposable personal income in 2012 ( versus 75 % for the last three decades of the twentieth century ) ; and a personal-saving rate has averaged just 3.9 % last year ( compared to 7.9 % from 1970 to 1999 ) . understandably , fixated on balance-sheet repair , america ’s consumers did not take the bait of their monetary and fiscal authority . instead , they have been cutting back on spending . gains from inflation-adjusted personal-consumption expenditures have averaged just 0.8 % in the last five years – the most severe and protracted deceleration of consumer demand in the post-world war ii era .
while his motivation , at least partly , may have been a yearning for social justice , perón was , in effect , bribing the beneficiaries to support his own ascension of power and wealth . with his beautiful , fuzzy wife – a “ womanhood ” woman at his counterpart at his side – perón managed to persuade voters in 1946 that , as president , he would fundamentally transform the country . he was as good as his word when he was elected . perón government-nationalized banks and railroads , raised the minimum wage and improved living standards , lowered national debts ( for a time being ) , and revived the economy . argentina became less reliant on foreign trade , even though moving toward autarky eventually undermined growth , causing the country to lose ground among the world ’s richest .
eventually , amid street riots and political mayhem , argentina abandoned its currency peg in 2002 . viewed argentina ’s ’s experience in mind , brazil ’s ’s ’s ’s spending cap looks problematic – all the more so against a backdrop of political tumult that is set to continue for the foreseeable future . the cap will likely become even more politically controversial once brazil recovers . it is not hard to imagine another administration – whenever it comes to – being perceiving the cap as an impediment to faster economic growth . the cap ’s defenders will sound unappealing , because the economics case for doing so is weak amid the missed extreme credibility problems .
part of this can be explained by misunderstandings about the relationship between stock market prices and economic growth . a strange conventional wisdom developed in the inflationary 1970s and 1980s : that strong economic growth and falling unemployment were bad for share prices . prosperity , felt , would incite inflation , provoke high interest rates , triggering a stock-market clamping down . while experts spent the past two years propounding that thesis , the market has quietly resumed an older , more common-sense rule : prosperity is good for profits , and therefore good for equities . here is one message from the markets worth pondering , even for non-investors : political trust may be at an all-time low ebb in europe ; companies and consumers may be shell-shocked by the latest recession and gloomy about the future ; but judging from market behavior in the years ahead are more likely to resemble the stable and prosperous 1950s and 1960s than the crisis-ridden decades from 1973 to 1989 .
elsewhere , the nigerian association of chambers of commerce , industry , mines , and agricultural ( nesps ) exploited its agenda over a number of years in order to coordinate economic reform . back in 1999 , this task assumed critical significance , owing to the country ’s opening to democracy . a legislative advisory program is yet another tool business may use to influence public policies . to shape the legislation of such programs , such programs are a question : * sound economic analysis and background papers readily available for technocrats and others to study ;
the currencies collapsed and the banking sector collapsed . the imf predicted that thailand and others achieved positive growth in 1998 ( by three percentage points for thailand , for example ) . now the imf recognizes that thailand will shrink by about three percentage points . its medicine did little to save the economy . the imf mobilized massive sums of money ( $ 118 billion in each case ) for indonesia , korea , and thailand to pay off foreign lenders trying to withdraw money .
the obama administration knows the iron-fisted law of american politics – “ it ’s the economy , stupid ” – – as well as anyone else . nevertheless , highlighting obama ’s ability to get things done abroad is more than an attempt at a distraction ; it also sends the message that domestic-policy impasse is not his own fault . so expect a lot of foreign-policy news in the coming months . election-year tactics aside , american voters are right . obama has done much better with his country ’s foreign policy than in domestic politics , which is all the more surprising given the soft hand that he has been dealt with : an america that has lost its moral authority , its military-invincibility , and its credibility as an economic model .
but it is only one facet of europe ’s urgent need for imports from people in africa and asia . europeans , too , will see the dismantling of their welfare states and social-security systems ; a cherished “ european model ” of pensions , health-care provision , and unemployment benefits that will replace the despised and widely feared “ american model . ” this is not , needless to say , because europeans crave america ’s rigors ’s rigors less cosseted social conditions , but because it is the only way that europe ’s governments can stay afloat financially . the root cause of all of these developments relates to european ’s populist shrinkage . the “ demographic time bomb ” that economic analysts have debated over ten years or more is now exploding .
they feel valiant in their belief that , for most western governments , outrage over iran ’s ’s ’s terrorist activities counts less than the lure of entrepreneurship . and they watch glee in how europe , japan , and america , rather than acting together , display the weaknesses of france . should a rogue state be allowed to get away with its provocations ? the issue , in most cases , is this : in most cases , it will . instruments of coercion that states dispose of short military interventions are imperfect and remotely efficient require a degree of international solidarity that is generated only in extraordinary circumstances .
london – a flawed understanding of what drives economic growth has emerged as the gravest threat to recovery in europe . european policymakers are obsessed with national “ competitiveness , ” ” ” ” ” ” and thus seem to think that prosperity is synonymous with trade surpluses . this largely explains why germany is routinely cited as an example of a strong , “ “ competitive ” economy . but economic growth , even in traditionally export-led economies , is fueled by productivity growth , rather than by the capacity to capture an increasing share of global markets . while imports must , of course , be financed by exports , a focus on trade competitiveness draws attention from europe ’s underlying problem – very weak productivity growth .
and the greater importance of battery cells is to the total value of electric cars , the stronger agglomeration effect will be . this , in turn , would represent a momentous shift . in fact , china currently controls entire value chain of electric automobiles , including trucking supply , an essential raw material in battery manufacturing . as a result , china generates 69 % of the world ’s electric-car battery cells ; the united states accounts for 15 % ( at tesla ’s “ a gigafactory ” rate in nevada ) ; europe emits a mere 4 % . nonetheless , europe could still develop battery production by recycling old electronics , developing new cobalt-saving processes , and discovering alternative mineral deposits .
at the same time , governments need to phase out bureaucratic red tape , so that entrepreneurs can take greater risks . but breakthrough technology companies like apple , facebook , and twitter also depend on people with access to well-funded education systems . and while there is increasing “ “ “ “ “ tech ” for good ” industries in europe , it will succeed only if it supports up-to-date infrastructure , which generally entails public outlays . policymakers in europe ( and elsewhere ) need to adjust their thinking – particularly their fiscal thinking – to put people first . governments that make it their central goal to maximize human well-being end up encouraging not only higher economic growth , but also nurturing healthier politics .
the initiative will have to come from the top if the case is to make it within each country for more open markets , and to help make it affordable for those facing adjustment . all countries will need to give up ; no country can expect to shoulder the burden alone . pro-trade forces can talk up in the political process . for example , it is untenable in wealthy countries that farm interests accounting for less than 4 % of employment effectively block an agreement to unlock new markets for services and manufactures that account for over 90 % of employment . in developing countries , pro-trade voices could help to turn the debate toward opportunities for global integration , rather than emphasized exceptions .
indeed , iran ’s hold firm backing for shia-led iraq was partly intended to preempt competition from regional opponents . but iranian critics of intervention seem convinced that there is a middle way . inter-korean dialogue in iraq , and a regional compromise with turkey and the gulf states do not necessarily translate into loss of iranian influence . iran has already countenanced maliki ’s removal in favor of haider al-abadi , and if broader policy reconsideration is needed to quell the threats , so be it . iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s hawks might believe that their country is invincible , but worries grow that regional overreach could trigger a long list of dangerous consequences .
in houston , the authorities were poised for harvard partly because of lessons learned from hurricane katrina that devastated new orleans in 2005 . that storm caused 1,833 deaths , whereas at least 88 was killed during harvard . the impact of lessons learned in india is all the more striking . in october 2013 , osa ’s oscar-state residents were alerted early to the advent of cyclone phailin . by the time the storm made landfall , many had already evacuated .
for catalan separatists , this means that they now confront what the political scientist hans morgenthau has termed the “ a-b-c paradox ” of nationalism . if catalonia wants to leave spain , why should n’t barcelona have the right to leave catalonia ? and why would n’t today ’s fundamentally oppressed ” catalans become tomorrow ’s oppressors to prevent this from happening ? given that the status quo is unstable and independence impossible , many believe that the only solution is more fiscal autonomy for catalonia . but this , too , is unlikely in the near term .
even that futile scenario might seem optimistic , for it assumes that talks get off the ground – an impossible feat if israel continues its illegal construction of settlements in the occupied palestinian territories . such activity is not simply unjust ; it is the violation of united nations security council resolution 2334 , adopted almost unanimously last year ( america , then led by barack obama , then abstained ) . that resolution demanded that israel immediately and completely stop all settlement activity in the occupied palestinian territories , including east jerusalem ” – activities that amount to flagrant violations under international law . any agreement between israelis and palestinians will require the deep concessions on either side , concessions that leaders on both sides will have to persuade its respective publics to accept . trump ’s ’s ’s ’s son-in-law and advisor , jared kushner , who has tasked with brokering the conflict , and the trump administration ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s chief negotiator on matters , jason greenblatt , seems to understand this .
the chinese authorities are well aware of how much their country has benefited from becoming deeply integrated into the global economy . and they are not ready to take risks stemming from their domestic legitimacy : economic growth . the belt and road initiative ( bri , formerly known as one belt , one road ) – whereby xi christened a century project – is a true reflection of china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s strategic choice to strengthen commercial links with the rest of eurasia and africa , seize the opportunity to accumulate “ soft power . ” in doing so , however , china is not openly challenged by the foundations of the liberal order . a remarkable communiqué from world leaders attending the bri forum in beijing last month has committed more than 30 countries and international organizations to promote “ peace , justice , social cohesion , inclusiveness , democracy , good governance , the rule of law , human rights , gender equality , and women . ”
the question , then , is whether the new leaders , as early as next month ’s day , succeed in adopting the vital institutional reforms required by the enlarged union . focusing on the essentials will be the best way forward . part iii of an blocked constitutional treaty is merely a compendium of existing eu treaties , which – because these treaties will remain in force , regardless of whether they are part of a new document – could be decoupled from the rest . part of the stalled documentary , the eu charter can be put aside . to be sure , this would be painful because , as eu bureaucracies gain more authority , the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s democratic deficit will widen without a clear definition of fundamental rights .
this applies to the nations of europe . for europe , however , there is an even more profound reason : the transatlantic alliance is needed today more than ever , and much stronger with britain in europe and europe an equal partner with america . forget about the short-term electoral politics of there , or at least here . in the longer term , this is basically an alliance of values : liberty , democracy , and the rule of law . as world change and opens up across borders of nation and culture that values the twenty-first century ?
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . similarly , just a couple of months ago , two police vice ministers , transportation minister , and a former director of state petroleum company were all brought to court on charges of selling state assets to private companies at a loss . taken together , these cases point to the high degree of state capture – a form of corruption , rife with former soviet-bloc countries , in which powerful private actors are using insiders to gain control over public institutions and assets .
a minority coalition that included the greens would force the csu toward a compromise on migration issues and climate policies that are pointless otherwise , given the spd ’s inability to die linke ( the left ) , and the greens to block legislation . and merkel herself would try to preempt a minority coalition with the fdp in order to prevent it from becoming addicted to it . for its part , the fdp wants to participate in such a government for precisely this reason . it would then have been able to contain merkel ’s red-green affinity . a minority government , whatever its composition , would not necessarily be a bad thing .
one us government minister at the cdf noted that the one million chinese tourists who went abroad last year were using their credit card to buy some $ 1 billion worth of goods they can not get at home ( while noting the irony that some of those europeans and american branded goods are actually manufactured in china ) . china is still a low-income country with per capita gdp of just $ 14,000 , about one-fourth of that in the united states . although beijing and shanghai are relatively prosperous , much poverty remains to be continued . they note that achieving the five-year plan ’s goal of halving poverty by 2020 requires reducing the number of poor people by 55 million , the poverty line is defined as just $ 354 per year , or less than one dollar per day . chinese corporations ’ high levels of gdp could be a source of financial fragility , though a few officials have stressed how badly they are .
but those who believe that the ccp can defy both the internal de-generative dynamics of autocracy and the historical record of failed one-party regimes might benefit from a reading leon trotsky familiar something about revolutions . dictatorships are considered indestructible before they fall , trotsky reminds us , but their demise is viewed as inevitable as soon as they are being toppled . another explanation is the fear of being contemplating from the previously unknown . ccp rule may not last , but an alternative – state-controlled default and civic chaos – could go a long way towards the status quo . but the record of democratic transitions since 1974 suggests that regime change in china is unlikely to come at a calamitous head .
neusoft started as a low-cost competitor for an oracle company . after moving on to manufacture car audio equipment , liu jiren , a ceo of the ceo of the university of science , began hearing complaints from local hospitals about the high costs of specialized x-ray , mri , ultrasound , and ct-scanning machinery ( for example , ge , philips , philips , siemens , and toshiba ) . suddenly , a new business was born . liu realized that neusoft could link standard intel chips and its own imaging software to a wide range of digital sensors . neusoft ’s devices seem like little personal computer with sensors attached .
princeton – by now , everyone knows that germany is calling the shots not only in the eurozone , but throughout all of europe . inside germany , the unending debates about german identity – what one historian has called “ the continual dispute about what being germany could mean . ” but , in foreign-policy terms , postwar west germany – and , later , a reunified germany – was totally predictable : never opposed to the west ; always for more europeans . now the republic of berlin is very secure about its national identity – and seemingly at sea in its dealings with the world . there are structural reasons for this change , too .
and the oversight that warped kelvin ’s estimate – the possibility that fluid motion might work efficiently transportation heat within earth ’s inner area – proved critical to understanding plate tectonics and continental drift . startup companies exemplifies the potential benefits of risk-taking . while only about 49 % of manufacturing startups and 37 % of information startups survive for four or more years , those that have succeeded in producing breakthroughs innovations . tom watson , a jr. , who led ibm through decades of robust growth , is well known for having supported brilliant blunders . as he put it , “ we should have the courage to take risks when they are thoughtful risk … . we need to forgive the mistakes that were made because someone tried to act aggressively in a company ’s interest .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . netanyahu ’s greatest threat comes from netanyahu .
according to putin , he rooted for trump ( but , of course , did n’t obstruct in trump ’s name ) , because they shared a desire to improve the bilateral relationship . now , more than ever before , putin needs america ’s own friendship . although he was reelected president in a landslide in march , his approval rating has since plummeted to 45 % . russians resent the mounting economic insecurity brought about by sanctions trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s predecessor , barack obama , initiated after russia ’s annexation of crimea in 2014 ( a move that initially bolstered putin ’s flagging approval ratings ) . popular discontent in russia has also been inflamed by the authorities ’ widely reviled pension reform , which includes an increase in the retirement age .
to be sure , wall street ( whose interests the american treasury represents ) profits from capital market liberalization : they make money as capital flows in , as it flows out , and in a restructuring that occurs in the ensuing havoc . in south korea , the imf urged sales of countries ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s banks to american investors , even as koreans were managing their own economies impressively for four decades , with higher growth , greater stability , and without the systemic scandals that marked america ’s financial markets with such frequency . in some cases , american firms bought up banks , held on it until korea recovered , and then resold them , reaping billions in capital gains . in its rush to have westerners purchase banks , the imf neglected one detail : ensuring that south koreans could recapture at least a fraction of those gains through taxation . whether american investors had greater banking expertise in emerging markets might be debatable ; having more expertise in tax avoidance is not .
princeton – on january 1 , derek parfit , one of the great philosophers of my generation , perished . just a year earlier , in a poll on a leading philosophy website , parfit had just been voting the most significant living anglophone philosopher . of all the philosophers that i had known since starting to study the topic more than 50 years ago , parfit came the closest to a genius . getting to a philosophical argument with him was like playing chess with a grandmaster : he had previously thought of every response i could make to his arguments , regarded a few potential replies , knowing the objections of each reply just as the top counters were to those objections . parfit was not a household name .
on paper , the hospital appears well staffed and properly equipped , but in my rounds there , i found halls and guk barren and barren . at the time , few therapeutic and diagnostic options were available . even a fundamental test like a cat per can require transportation for another regional medical hospital . but under-equipped hospitals may not be the greatest obstacle to controlling china ’s aids crisis . equally harmful are the government ’s sensitivity to its own policy failures , and the stigma attached to a malady that often follows sexually .
comparing the outcomes of these two simulations suggests that large palestinian labor flows to israel are reducing the palestinian economy ’s capacity to export goods by putting upward pressure on wages , undermining competitiveness . such simulations have also hinted that sustained reliance on exporting labor outcomes within the context of less growth potential for the palestinian economy than does a development strategy based on exporting goods . but average incomes in the west bank and gaza will remain much lower under the latter strategy than they would be if the israeli labor market gradually reopened for palestinian labor . this confirms the enormous short-run welfare costs to a palestinian society of restricting palestinian labor ’s access to an israeli labor market . so , which trade policies might boost exports of goods rather than labor ?
addis ababa – when zimbabwe ’s president robert mugabe was deposed in november 2017 , after 30 years in power , many hoped that the economic decline he oversaw would soon be reversed . yet , a year and a half later , economics shows no sign of recovery , owing to the ongoing currency crisis . could a blockchain-based cryptocurrency be a cure for what flying zimbabwe ? following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges for american interests elsewhere in the world .
but , in this case , when a son borrows essential features of his father ’s architectural principles and serves a regime that seeks to use the games for some of the same reasons that animated hitler does not willingly reflect those sins ? totalitarian regimes – the nazis , the soviets in the 1980 ’s , and now a chinese – desire to host the olympics as a way to signal to the world ’s supremacy . china believes that it finds its own model for development and modernization , and that its rulers regard the games in terms of the same way that nazis and leonid brezhnev did as a means to “ “ sell ” their model to a global audience . clearly , the chinese were politically tone-deaf in selecting an architect whose name carrying such dark historical connotations . the name of speer himself probably did not matter to bureaucrats choosing him .
the road to tiananmen square this apparent circle is by noting that we love our motherland not because of a misplaced sense of ethnic or racial supremacy , but because it stands for both noble and universal values . macron may proudly call himself a french patriot , because france has given way to a worldwide liberté , égalité , and fraternité . in the recent dutch election , liberals might argue against the rights of immigrants , because respect and tolerance are traditional dutch values , of which any dutch patriot can take pride . these are examples of what the philosopher jürgen habermas has described as constitutional patriotism ( others have called it civic patriotism ) . this philosophical position has practical consequences .
carrying out such investigations effectively and without delay would restore the icc ’s credibility and bolster its capacity to fulfill its intended role as a powerful force for international justice . in order to succeed , the icc will need to overcome strong opposition , not just from dictators and warlords , but even from elected leaders , particularly us president donald trump . in april , after determining whether to proceed with its investigative crimes in afghanistan – including any potentially perpetrated by american forces – the trump administration revoked the court ’s visa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s chief prosecutor . if the icc is to fulfill the role it has created , it can neither bow to such pressure , nor allow its deficient performance to continue . instead , its leaders – particularly its chief prosecutor , jpmorgan fatou bensouda – must take recent criticism as motivation , demonstrating that they are up to the task .
new york – capital-account regulations have been at the center of global financial debates for the last two years . the reasons are obvious : since the world was experiencing a multi-speed recovery , ” ” ” as the international monetary fund puts it , slow-growth advanced countries maintain very low interest rates and other expansionary monetary policies , while fast growth emerging economies are unwinding the expansionary policies they adopted during recessions . this asymmetry spurred enormous capital inflows from the former to the latter , probably continuing to do so . emerging economies worry that this flood of capital drives their currencies ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ exchange rate , apart from fueling current-account deficits and asset bubbles , which past experience has taught them , is a decidedly recipe for future crises . compounding , the problem lies in the fact that one of countries undertaking expansionary policies is the united states , which has the world ’s largest financial sector and issues paramount global currencies .
greenpeace , together with other organizations opposed the use of genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) , had campaigned against the establishment of the beta carotene , who is converted in human bodies into vitamin a. gmos ) . moore ’s ’s mortality figures seem to be at high levels , but they do not doubting the severity of vitamin a deficiency among children , particularly in parts of africa and southeast asia . according to the world health organization , this causes blindness in some 250,000-500,000 preschool children every year , some half of whom die in just 12 months . the deficiency also increases sensitivity to diseases like measles , still a major cause of death in young children , though one that is declining in the wake of vaccinations . likewise , a lack of vitamin a is a major factor driving high maternal mortality rates during pregnancy and childbirth .
so which lessons do history have to teach us about our current global economic predicament ? back in 1829 , john stuart mill made the key intellectual leap , in figuring out how to fight what he called “ general gluts . ” mill saw that excess demand for some particular set of assets in financial markets was mirrored by an excess supply of goods and services in product markets that , in turn , generated an excess supply of workers in labor markets . the implication of this was clear . if you relished excess demand for financial assets , you also cured the excess supply of goods and services ( a shortcoming of aggregate demand ) and an excess supply of labor ( mass unemployment ) .
no single actor – that is , it is a government , a world-class research laboratory , an ngo , an entrepreneur , or a group of investors – can solve today ’s genuinely great problems on its own . it is a gap visible in areas as diverse as health care , education , and combating climate change . that is why chan zuckerberg initiative was designed for maximum flexibility , allowed money to be channeled into non-profits , directed toward private investment , or used to help influence policy debates . similarly , the bec committed himself to boost work for others by taking “ a elastic , start-up ” approach , providing seeds , angel , and series of investments , with the expectation that once those investments were de-risking , traditional commercial capital would invest later in ” ” ” ” . of course , not even billionaires can fix the world ’s problems .
american populists , perhaps inspired by thomas piketty ’s writings , seem unimpressed by the fact that globalization lifted hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in china and india into the global middle class . the liberal view of asia ’s rise is that it makes the world a fairer and more just place where a person ’s economic fate does not depend fairly on where it was born . but a more cynical view pervades the populist logic , namely that , in its excessively adherence to globalism , america has sown the seeds of its own political and economic devastation . trumpism taps into this sense of national mortality ; here is someone who thinks that it can do something about it . the goal is not simply to “ “ “ bring home ” ” american jobs , but to create a system that tends to expand american dominance .
one approach would enhance deterrence by bolstering the conventional south korean and american forces and reintroducing tactical nuclear weapons in the south . but more conventional power would add little to the force already on the ground , bringing nuclear arms back to south korea would merely make both sides more anxious ( and offshore american naval forces already pack an adequate punch in order to reinforce deterrence ) . another approach would seek to normalize diplomacy , on the presumption that doing so could enhance communication , thereby diminishing the nuclear threat . but , under such a scenario , north korea might hold relations hostage to such outsize demands as the withdrawal of american forces from the region and the economic and energy assistance needed to prop up the regime . ultimately , north korea ’s stalinist administration will rebuff any effort that encroaches on the isolation it needs to remain in power .
thus , the populist backlash in latin america – in brazil , bolivia , ecuador , and , most disastrously , venezuela – took away leftist form . the story is similar in the top two exceptions to the right-wing resurgence in europe – greece and spain . in greece , the main political fault line was the austerity policies imposed by european institutions and the international monetary fund . in spain , most immigrants until recently came from culturally similar latin american countries . in both countries , the far right has lacked the breeding ground it has elsewhere .
british and american negotiators secretly met with libyan counterparts in order to resolve the case for the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland , and other issues of terrorism . in the quid pro quo that followed , qaddafi agreed to remove his nascent nuclear program in exchange for an end to the status of pariah . this was coupled with a critical demand : no deal without america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s commitment to eschew regime change . on december 19 , 2003 , libya formally renounced all wmd ’s efforts . eight years later , pinned down by a american predator drone and french airstrikes , qaddafi met with his demise .
botswana ’s amazing annual per capita income growth of about 13 % during the past decade was accompanied by a drop from almost six children per woman to less than four . why is rapid population growth really bad for a country ’s standard of living ? the math is simple : more people mean that ( on average , ) everyone gets less . a growing population dilutes not only the accumulation of physical capital . the quality of children in poor households goes down as their quantity rises because poor families with many children are unable to invest enough in educating every child to ensure that future adults benefit from a key determinant of economic success .
like it or not , they can not do so that as a dutch brigade ; they need to pick leaders who can speak for them and negotiate for them . the modernizers need to form a coherent force – and most likely a political party – rather than relying simply on the wisdom ( and good behavior ) of crowds out the crowd in order to govern the country . that does not mean that activists should abandon the cause . but it does imply an understanding that even democracy has many rules – ideally the rules that are chosen . but it does want to sound a little bit like the old system .
rising incomes ; rising health-care demand , childcare , and elder care in aging societies ; and investment in infrastructure , energy , and technology create new job opportunities . given the sectoral and work-sharing of these opportunities , women may be slightly better positioned to take advantage of them . assuming that current gender occupational and sectoral patterns hold , women could gain access to 20 % more jobs than they do today , compared to just 19 % for men . this slight benefit for women reflects the robust growth that is expected in sectors like health care , where women are well represented . indeed , in many countries , women account for more than 70 % of health-care and social-assistance workers , and that sector could comprise one-quarter of future job opportunities for women ( production accounts for a similar share of potential work gains for men ) .
i myself once witnessed putin ’s excursion of culture . it was a new year ’s eve in 2003 , in a concert at the newly opened house of music in moscow . directly through the aisle from me , putin went on to sit between a one-time dissident cellist and conductor masslist and conductor massstislav rostropovich , and his equally famous wife , opera diva galina vishnevskaya . russia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leader was like an kid in a candy store – thrilled to face these cultural icons former exiles no less . and the icons were obviously flattered by putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s adoration ( and its proximity to power ) .
but gdp growth soon began to accelerate rapidly . in seeking to revive growth amid a difficult global environment and buffer exports against the effects of the asian financial crisis , the chinese government loosened monetary and fiscal policies early in november 1997 . but , again , it was too little too late . by 1998 , when cpi inflation began to fall , producer prices were already declining for more than eight months , and remained negative for at least 51 months , with cpi growth starting to recover after 39 months . an obvious lesson is that the government should switch to loosening earlier .
so , have we now moved from piketty ’s r > g world to blanchard ’s r < g world ? if so , can their views be reconciled ? the answer is neither and yes . indeed , piketty and blanchard can be reconciled because they debate different interest rates . whereas blanchard focuses on rates on low-risk government bond purchases , piketty worries about the returns on risky capital investment .
banks have not failed , and there is no sign of tumbling dominos . but this is not , because the banks are ready to raise more capital . on the contrary , compared to their likely future losses , european banks have raised relatively little capital recently , and much of it has been creative accounting rather than actually loss-absorbing shareholder equity . perhaps the risk that greek debt restructuring would trigger a financial meltdown has always been minimal , with quiescent markets foretold . but , in that case , why all this fuss really did ?
in the scandinavian countries , unlike switzerland , denmark , germany and switzerland , switzerland , governments , rather than individual companies , account for most social benefits . that way , an economically irrational lock-in effects whereby workers simply can not afford to change jobs are avoided . moreover , the benefits are generous enough to ensure that short periods of joblessness do not force workers to sell their homes or even cars . the system protects not only the unemployed , who can continue paying their mortgages and interest , but also indirectly , because their loans to households are paid even in times of recession . and , rather than solving all forms of economically induced economically , post workers can concentrate on finding new , more future-oriented jobs .
the irony is that this advice comes after much of their former productive capacity vanished . but , having suffered currency and capital-account crises with greater openness , many emerging-market economies remain compelled to accumulate huge reserves to protect themselves in the face of greater global financial volatility . while financial globalization did not boost growth , it amplified volatility and instability . meanwhile , domestic “ policy space ” for economic recovery has shrunk since the crisis . public-sector investment and basic social protection can help turn this around , by creating millions of jobs .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . one aspect of this supposed moral and cultural decline concern the family : attacking the family ’s institution , regarding it with its contempt , or having doubts its important role , ” ” ” ” a pope and a grand imam state “ “ “ is one of the most threatened evils of our era . ” the paper asserts that a family is the neither the fundamental corporate nucleus of societies nor humanity nor “ is essential in bringing children to the world , raise them , educate them , and grant them solid moral formation and domestic security ” .
addis ababa – with nearly 60 % of its population under age 25 , africa is the world ’s youngest region . yet it is widely recognized that young people are often left behind . they have frequently faced inadequate economic opportunities , and can also be socially or politically excluded . unless youth socioeconomic and political engagement are addressed , many of the united nations ’ sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) will be impossible . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
in the nineteenth century , no country took more land from china than it did in russia ; the current demography situation in the far east , where a russian population of six million and a population on the chinese side of the border is up to 120 million – a source of anxieties in moscow . russia ’s economic decline has increased its anxiety about the rise of china . whereas trade has increased , investment lags , and russia ranks only one-tenth among china ’s ’s ’s exports markets . as the economist recently reported , russia worries about becoming an alliance ’s junior partner – more dependent on china than they are on russia . according to fia yujun of fudan university , “ the single most important relationship for the us is america ’s one .
florence – in phaedrus , a well-known videotape and a lamb , martin wolf could easily eat his lamb without a word but prefers to set his “ grounds . ” first , he scolds the lamb precisely because he muddying his drinking water ( even as wolf was upstream ) . then he argues that last year , the lamb named him the bad names ( but the lamb was just six months old ) . wolff then snarls that if it were not a lamb , he was his father ; after that , he moved immediately to action . martin wolf ’s “ “ justifications ” for his evil action ” was a luxury .
arlington , virginia , virginia – the election left one of the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largest deep divisions , deeply divided countries , handing the presidency to an adloving , minority-bullying , media-bashing promising to smash the “ corrupt establishment . ” i am speaking not on the 2016 us presidential election , which featured donald trump in power , but rather the 2018 election in brazil won by the so-called trump of the tropics , jair bolsonaro , who was formally inaugurated on january 1 . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
she then quickly stepped up to give a long celebratory speech about the denunciation of us soldiers ’ heroism “ “ by struggle for freedom ” abroad . it appeared odd – and to many insulting – a transition : from a king ’s grand plea to a civilian right ’s palin ’s sentimental clichés about the military . but then there was something strange about the entire event , just as something strange about the tea party movement itself . this latest surge of american populism is financed by some extraordinarily wealthy men , including some of the oil billionaires named david and charles koch , who favor cutting taxes for the super-rich and abolishing governments ’ subsidies to the poor , such as social security and president barack obama ’s health-care plan . that agenda might seem selfish , albeit understandable from the point of view of the oil billionaire .
the beginning of his papacy finds populist governments in a vulnerable situation , hit hard by chávez ’s recent deaths . of course , they all have their own identity and strengths , but miss out on chávez ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s global influence , as well as its subsidies . moreover , they govern those countries where the catholics hold an overwhelming majority . although the degree of their religious commitment differs , they share powerful emotional attachment to beliefs , which ensures that francis i retain considerable political leverage . latin america will undoubtedly be one of francis ’s priorities .
the us needs to lead the world through pretrial and by example . but obama can not do it alone – and so far neither the american public nor the american congress appears committed to reconnecting with its moral compass . this should be intolerable to the us congress , for example , to block the release of 86 guantánamo bay detainees cleared by the us national-security commission . not even the revelations by the former us intelligence contractor edward snowden that none is exempt from america ’s opportunities for surveillance has stirred up american efforts to demand a new approach . answering a second major question shaping the world ’s future – whether china will regain its economic momentum also appears to be “ no , ” at least in the short term , with most experts agreeing that china ’s exports – and a investment-led growth model have all but exhausted its potential .
nevertheless , substantive and remarkable advances have been made , all in the last couple of years . moreover , someday , we will know – through the sequencing of entire genome – about rarer genomic variations that are linked to therapy or effects . this has paved the way for the next-generation pharmacies . genotyping can now be accomplished in 20 minutes , and over time will get even faster . to fill the prescription for a drug with an well-known pharmacogenomic profile , a customer can get rapid genotyping to identify the right drug , drugs , or predilection for serious spillover effects .
the financial crisis produced a fresh response to where the top competitive benefits lie . from banks ’ ’ perspective , the most obvious lesson was the need for a strong national government to bear the potential costs of rescue . it is no longer the best way to succumb to the most good regulatory regime , but to be where the state has deepest pockets . very big banks in tiny territories with small-scale governments are vulnerable . america is large enough to manage behemoths like the bank of america or citigroup .
so far , we have done comparable analysis about the fate of the caribbean and indian oceanic islands following the first human contact , but probably because large numbers of extinctions have occurred , too . early european exploration has probably continued to sustain this rapid pace of extinction . the number of species known to have expired between 1,500 and 1800 rising as taxonomists describe new species from skeletal remains to be found in caves , for example , where bones survive . these searches are far from complete . linneaus invented the modern process of naming species in the mid-1700 ’s , though naming was not turned under way until the tranquility following napoleon bonaparte ’s defeat in 1815 .
syria , iraq , yemen , and libya are all coping with a mix of civilian and proxy wars . iran ’s nuclear pact at best manages one aspect of iranian power . the islamic state ( isis ) may lose its territorial dimension ; but it , along with other groups , continues to pose a terrorist threat for years to come . the plight of millions of refugees constitutes not only a humanitarian tragedy , but also an economic and strategic boon to countries in the region and europe . and europe is already confronting many significant challenges , including russia ’s aggression against ukraine , brexit , the rise of populism and nationalism , and low rates of economic growth .
those movements created the space for forward-thinking politicians to take action . nevertheless , the climate crisis continues to grow , demonstrating that we still have a long way to go . this year alone , catastrophicheat waves had stricken north africans , europe , japan , pakistan , australia , and argentina . deadly wildfires took lives and destroyed billions of dollars worth of property in greece , sweden , the united states , and russia . droughts hit kenya and somalia hard ; and afghanistan and south africa suffered major water shortages .
that is at the start of an important dialogue . the stakes for both africa and the americas are high . a strong , prosperous africa with a productive and expanding middle class is in america ’s interest , and a strong partnership with america will be vital for africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s continued growth and development . the decisions that we make now will have consequences for generations to come . we owe it to our offspring – and to silicon savannah entrepreneurs already head the charge – to get it right .
paris – some countries are naturally at ease with both the concept and the reality of strategic power . such was clearly the case for france under louis xiv , the sun king in the seventeenth century , and such is the case today for china , whose leadership is comfortable with the balance-of-power games of classical europe . clearly , india is in a very different category , and it is today . economically , india ’s trust has been boosted by how the western world now looks at it with a mixture of respect and greed : “ what kinds of deals can i strike with such an emerging market , whose populations would soon be any of any country in the world ’s largest ? ” yet , to understand india ’s political and diplomatic relationship with the outside world , the most enlightening comparison is with america in 1920 .
views about social mobility are incoherent across the political spectrum or across geographic regions . in both america and europe , for example , those calling themselves “ conservative on matters of economic policy ” believe that equal opportunities exist for all children , and that a free-market economy in their countries is just fair . the reverse holds true for those who call themselves economically “ liberal . ” these people favor government interference because they believe that , left to their own devices , markets will not ensure fairness and may even generate more inequality . an even more striking pattern is that americans are overly optimistic about social mobility in parts of a country where actual mobility rates are low – including the southeastern lhasa , alabama , virginia , north carolina , and south carolina .
the grocer , the coffee shop , and the barber go out of business and everybody leaves it , turning the place into a ghost town . the disruption can be attributed not simply to industrial closures . once upon a time , there were a many relatively small department-store chains and other vendors with headquarters spread throughout america , as well as outlets in several towns . those headquarters brought incomes back into their cities by providing back-office services to their shops network . but the consolidation in the retail industry , driven partly by walmart and amazon , dealt an deathblow to many such firms .
the bat has no shortage of support even among republicans , and it would break the rules of the world trade organization . the republicans ’ proposed tax cuts would create a $ 2 trillion revenue shortfall over the next decade , unable to plug that hole with revenues from their health-care reform plan , or with the $ 1.2 trillion expected from the tpp . the republicans now must choose between passing their tax cuts ( and adding $ 2 trillion to us government debt ) and pursuing a much more modest reform . the first scenario is unlikely , for three reasons . first , fiscally conservative congressional republicans will object to reckless increases in us public debt .
such resilience will be tested over the longer term , although , owing to the fiscal and external imbalances that were unaffected by data revision . part of the analytical ’s analytical attractiveness for national income accounts is that they add up . if a country saves more but investment remains unchanged , then it borrows less from ( or lends more to ) the rest of the world . its net export position , and the current-account balance , improves . but that did not happen in this case .
first , when it comes to climate change , the important thing is to look like doing anything . countries that manage to get off with massaging . the 2015 paris climate agreement is a prime example of this . countries have made grandiose pledges to keep the global temperature rise well below 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels , but all of their promises together to add up to less than 1 % of what ’s needed . new analysis shows that only 17 countries – including algeria and samoa – are actually meeting their pledges in most cases because they promised very little .
thawing siberian permafrost released vast quantities of methane . as a result , huge areas of our planet , currently home to billions of people , could become uninhabitable . the earlier conferences of the unfccc signatories sought to achieve legally binding emission-reduction agreements , at least for the industrialized countries that have made most of their greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere . that strategy faltered in part because of american intransigence under president george w. bush ’s – and was abandoned when the 2009 copenhagen conference failed to produce a treaty to replace the expiring kyoto protocol ( which the american people never signed ) . instead , the accord merely called for countries to cut their co2 emissions by concrete amounts .
along the same lines , throughout russian prime minister dmitri medvedev ’s ’s ’s presidency , he called for creating a mechanism for european preventive diplomacy and compulsory consultation when confronting any state ’s security threats . had such a mechanism been established , the worst-case events in ukraine could have been averted . to be sure , political leaders are to blame for filing away these and other “ european ” ideas ” in the archives . but the blame must also share with europe ’s entire political class , civil-society institutions , and the news media . though i am , by nature , an optimist , i must admit that it is very hard not to be pessimistic as 2014 comes close .
when it comes to solutions , europe goes ahead . for example , my home country , denmark , which was tasked with leading energy talks at the un summit , has integrated huge amounts of wind power across its electricity grid . sweden , which runs an industry boom with india , has created the world ’s first fossil-fuel-based power plants . and progress has hardly been confined to northern europe : romania boasts europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largest onshore farm ; poland produces electric buses ; and austria takes the lead when it comes to green buildings . but , as europe ’s leaders increasingly recognize , it is time to hit the accelerator .
tolerance for other people ’s religion is the price paid for tolerance of one ’s own kind . prejudice has tended to decline as participation increases . it has been in no one ’s interest to disturb this live-, let-live pragmatism for very long . one consequence of the arrangement is a paradoxical-sounding “ familiarity ” with the difference . because immigrants participate in america ’s economic and political arenas , americans use different kinds of people , and differentiate those distinctions that might damage countries from those that do not .
this keeps small businesses in poor nations and regions out of their full potential . based on our own experiences -- in mexico , which opened itself up to foreign investment and trade , and in canada , as a leader in aid and a major source of private investment in developing countries -- we are convinced that many of these problems can be identified , isolated , and fixed . entrepreneurial energy is already there : the visit of tiniest city in the poorest country on the market day , and you will see the private sector through action . if small companies could expand beyond rural square , they could drive the growth of their countries better off than any aid agency ever did . this is why when un secretary-general kofi annan and un development program stefan malloch asked us to lead the new private-sector commission and development , we agreed .
there is no guarantee that he will not repeat this gambit . and yet , even if he does , kim ’s own penchant for drama – from firing rockets over japan to carrying out frequent purges at home – suggests that he knows how to command the stage and bring trump to the table . moreover , his ego-stroking personal letters to trump show that he has a good fix on the us president ’s psyche . thus far , he has proven very effective at keeping a bromance alive and a forthcoming summit on track . regardless of when his second summit occurs , the north korean regime will continue to reap dividends at america ’s expense in the meantime .
amid intensifying inequality , frustration with pervasive corruption has intensified further . in 2018 , kazakhstan ranked 124th out of 180 countries in transparency international ’s ’s ’s corruption perceptions index . meanwhile , the state fails to deliver basic safety : in july 2018 , an olympic ice-skating medalist , denis ten , was assassinated in the center of kazakhstan ’s largest city , almaty , to try to prevent its car mirrors the stolen . all of this made emigration an increasingly appealing option , particularly for the young , raising the specter of a “ brain drain . ” it has also reversed heat on simmering social unrest , which boiled over since nazarbayev ’s resignation ( which may well have been intended explicitly to preempt popular protests ) .
but whenever the kingdom sought to cut public-sector hiring , the unemployment rate soared . under the current system of incentives , the authorities ’ ’ ’ plans for privatization of companies and improved civil-service productivity would actually destroy the jobs occupied by the saudis . the challenge of saudis job creation might seem like a blip . some would argue that all the kingdom needs to do is to make up saudi for foreign workers in existing positions . but simple substitution will not do .
the whole point of money is that it enables the parties to transact without having to barter . but for money to have value and generate economies of scale only so many currencies can operate simultaneously . in the us , the reason that the us does not use euros or yen when it comes to dollars is obvious : doing so would make the us economy far less efficient . the idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies could viably operate collectively not just contradicts a very concept of money ; it is totally idiotic . but so , too , is the notion that even a single cryptocurrency could substitute for fiat money .
a cool war is threatening to undermine these efforts , because confronting the american side at the negotiating table requires that china bolster its own position above all . this means ensuring that disruptions stemming from america ’s short-termism do not present a long-term systemic threat to china , even as they hurt the global economy as a whole . the unfolding sino-american trade war is far less cutting and dried up than during the cold war . minimizing the fallout will require both sides to recognize that in an interconnected world , efforts to bolster their own position become self-defeating when it undermine global stability and dynamism . the us trade war has thrown that lesson in sharp relief .
studies ahead of the paris conference suggest that international cooperation could enable rapid reduction of greenhouse gases . they also highlight the knock-on advantages that taking quick action on climate change might have , including reducing local pollution , greater energy and food security , and more rapid innovation . to accelerate the shift toward a low-carbon economy , an international agreement must apply to all countries ; included a common and consistent system for monitoring , reporting , and verification ; and provide strong economic incentives on a global scale . our price-and-rebate mechanism is inspired by the “ dieselmalus ” scheme in france , in which buyers of new cars are taxed or given a bonus based on co2 emissions . in our system , a country exceeding the global per capita emissions average would pay a specified amount to each ton of co2 ( or its equivalent ) above a set threshold .
by purchasing government bonds for cash , a central bank can meet demand , pushing down the price of cash . in the absence of excess demand for cash , there will not be an excess supply of the bonds and stocks that underpin and finance the economy ’s productive capital . thus , expansionary monetary policy through the standard re-market operation of the central bank is the first item on the checklist of what to do during a financial crisis . three months ago , i argued that all but a tiny and untrammeled fringe of economists approve of expansionary open-market operations to keep total nominal spending constant in a downturn , and that i was right . i was also right to say that all but the untrammeled fringe of economists approve of system stability to avert the risk of a payment system ’s collapse from becoming a first-order consideration boosting cash demand to unnatural levels .
the eastward expansion of nato and the european union , they contend , amounted to an unnecessary provocation . in fact , none other than george kennan , the originator of america ’s ’s ’s ’s cold war containment strategy , opposed nato ’s enlargement in the 1990s on precisely these grounds . there are obvious limits to this theory in the us . for starters , it harks back to the claims that during the time of the berlin wall and the soviet union ’s disintegration and the soviet union ’s disintegration , the west promised that nato enlargement would have been achieved . even mikhail gorbachev , on the 25th anniversary of the wall ’s demise , charged the west not keeping the promises it made in 1989 , instead amassing russia ’s weakening ” in the 1990s to assert “ monopoly leadership and domination of the world , ” including through nato enlargement .
at the same time , the international monetary fund has gotten itself in the act . even though its october world economic outlook presents a positive picture of global growth , the imf , undoubtedly remains conscious of the panglossian view it offered in 2006 , now warns that the world economy finds itself “ “ “ “ vulnerable ” to a precipitous tightening of financial conditions ” and subpar equity valuations in some markets . against this background , “ “ some ” is the imf code . ” america ’s market ’s ’s ’s share of global equity valuations is its highest ever was – a noteworthy statistic that reflects the declining american share of global economic activity . how , then , should we view all of these warnings ?
i have also developed what i called the adjusted gsdeer , which corrects the “ equilibrium ” rate for an ongoing economic cycle , through accounting for factors like the actual interest-rate differential between the us and the eurozone . which interest rates work best for making comparisons are a matter of debate as they are the effects of quantitative easing ; but i see no good reason not to take advantage of the often-government-bond differential , adjusted for inflation-protected expectations . accordingly , the adjusted gsdeer for the euro-dollar exchange rate , as it is for june 7 , was € 1 : $ 1,0590 . given that the us dollar was trading at around $ 1.1250 against the euro on that day , this indicates that the us dollar is actually about 6 % weaker than it should be . now , of course , 6 % is no particularly significant difference , and that finding might mean nothing at all .
the party came to a crashing halt in 2009 , when two sharp-elbowed global investment banks accelerated borrowing repayments – hope to get their money back again . the kazakh government , scrambling to support its overextended private banks with capital injections and nationalizations , surrendered , and opted for pulling the plug . banks defaulted on their loans , and lenders took large “ haircuts ” ( reducing principal value ) . but , and here ’s the point – with its debts written off , the banking system is now recapitalized and capable of supporting economic growth . notwithstanding a messy default , this fresh start has generated a remarkable turnaround .
in the drc , for example , even after all this time we reach just 8 % of the world ’s 760,000 children . just $ 230 per year per person on average is available for basic needs like water , food , and shelter , and less than $ 10 per child headed toward education . this year needs to be education on the window of opportunity opened by a new consensus that education is critical to achieving the un sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) , including cutting maternal and infant mortality rates , encouraging job creation , improving quality of life , and opening our thinking to gender equality . most importantly , this is an education ’s moment , because the world ’s young people are demanding it . when a girl holds a book up to an insurgent ’s gun in pakistan , when teenage mothers exiled from south sudan in neighboring uganda make education to their children their top priority , and when lights saw from space could integrate babies huddled and study , we know that educating ’s ’s moment has come .
us president jimmy carter used it to conclude the 1978 camp david accords , establishing diplomacy between egypt and israel . and us secretary of state james baker used it to transcend the recalcitrance of israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir during the 1991 madrid peace conference . if an america can not provide that today , it must relinquish its monopoly on the resolution of international conflict . it is time for america to recognize that it can not resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict , dismantle the iranian nuclear dispute , alter north korea ’s behavior , or stem the syrian civil war entirely . during the past two decades , the world has grown accustomed to us-led international coalitions for war in the middle east .
by appeasing terrorists in this manner , the world ’s most powerful states give a green light to terrorists not just in the balkans but anywhere in the world . kosovo is an area far smaller than afghanistan ’s . if the world does not succeed in expending political terrorists in kosovo , what hope does it have of defeating terrorism elsewhere ? so , before the anti-terror campaign seeks other terrorist outposts to crush , it should eliminate terror in an area where the un itself governs . if not , the un , nato , and the european union will discredit themselves as much as the humanitarian values they use to justify their `` humanitarian '' interventions .
if the relationship between the fruit fly 's genes and behaviors becomes so complicated , could it possibly become any less so with humans ? the view that an individual gene might account for an absolute biological trait is as old as genetics itself . whether describing genes for the color of bloa tree in pea plants , or the shape of the fruits fly , geneticists at the beginning of the past century believed that every gene guided one unique characteristic . soon , several early geneticists , the founders of the eugenics movement , made the odious assertion that “ licentiousness , ” “ shiftlessness , ” and “ criminality ” could all account for individual genes as well . as time passed , and the scientific knowledge accumulated -- much of it from fruit fly -- the true complexity of the relationship of genes and became clear .
and , after all , you ca n’t have a definitive , utopian society without having ultimate , science theory of human conduct , together with some mad scientists or philosophes to preside over the matter . the problem is that , whatever the “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ ” ” ” ” these new beliefs have been formulated , they remain bogus . among other things , capitalism entails a struggle among individual individuals over control of scarce resources . like boxing and poker , this is soft , restrained , private forms of warfare . military strategists have known for centuries that there is and could be , no definitive science of war .
paris – earlier this week , following days of tense debate , the new government in athens reached an agreement with its eurozone creditors , which includes a immediate reform package and a four-month extension of the eu finance assistance program . but , despite europe ’s collective sigh of relief , the compromise does not rule out the need for further tough negotiations on a new financial-assistance program that was supposed to put in place by the end of june . in any negotiation , a key variable influence on the protagonists ’ behavior , hence the outcome , is what failure to reach an agreement would cost each . in that case , the issue is the costs of greece ’s exit ( “ grexit ” ) from the eurozone – a prospect that has been widely discussed in media across the course of recent negotiations , with substantial speculation about the stance among the various players , particularly greek and german governments . from greece ’s perspective , abandoning the euro would be hugely disruptive , which explains why very little support exists within the country .
elections in countries strangers to democracy have never been quite pretty clear , because afghanistan ’s recent vote demonstrated and , like any election in iraq , will probably be . but electoral flaws are not always the whole picture . consider kazakhstan , where up to five million people cast cylandon in september for their parliament ’s lower house of parliament . western media , for their part , judged the failure of an election as a result of the electoral college . cnn reported it “ neither equitable nor free . ”
it is largely a matter of providing public goods : basic infrastructure like roads , bridges , ports , and power , as well as for access to education and basic health care . and , unlike many equally poor countries , india already possesses a very powerful entrepreneurial class , a reasonably large and well-educated middle class , and a host of world-class corporations that can be enlisted in trying to provide such public goods . satisfying the demand for such goods by itself fosters growth . but , too , a reliable road generates enormous added additional activity , as trade increases among connected areas , as well as myriad enterprises , restaurants , and hotels spring up along the way . as india went off with the stultifying license raj in the 1990 ’s , successive governments understood the imperative of generating economic growth , so much so that the bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) challenged the 2004 pro-development platform election , encapsulated in the campaign .
its infrastructure , both material and intellectual , became poorer , and its economic structure unfit for new challenges , owing both to solid size and specialization in traditional sectors as well as to low levels of education and research and development . still , berlusconi ’s government did next to nothing to address these shortcomings , despite being the first government in italy ’s history to survive a full five-year electoral term . with an unassailable parliamentary majority , it could pursue coherent supply-side reforms , even at the risk of some initial unpopularity . a few reforms were belatedly enacted : timid pension intervention and other increases in labor-market flexibility . but nothing was done to deregulate product markets , or to give proper restructuring incentives , while privatization arrived .
indeed , despite civil wars , malnutrition , and anguish in the aids epidemic , something remarkable is happening in black africa : the stealthy rise of a high-technology sector . if not quite representing “ silicon valley , ” these shoots of the high-tech industry nonetheless can and must be nurtured if africa is to flourish . consider what is happening on several floors of a unified high office built in accra , ghana ’s capital . there were some 1,500 africans who process american health-insurance claims – working around the clock , during three shifts . africans speak english , type at least 50 words a minute on a computer ; take paper data claims from american medical insurers through satellite in electronic terms ; put it in new digital forms ; and ships them back to america .
yet the westphalian system was ravaged by the two world wars of the first half of the twentieth century – both of which were really europe ’s wars for world domination . when the guns fell silent in 1945 , europeans – even victorious europe ’s allies – effectively lost their national sovereignty . the westphalian system was replaced by the cold war bipolar order , wherein sovereignty rested with the two non-european nuclear powers : the united states and the soviet union . the eu was conceived as an attempt to reclaim european sovereignty peacefully by pooling the national interests of european states . the goal of this effort was always to prevent a relapse into the old system of strength rivalries , reciprocal alliances , and hegemonic head butting .
in october and november , the ecb will announce the performance of its bank stress tests . because many banks hold a huge volume of eurozone sovereign debt , the results will depend heavily on how the ecb evaluates sovereign risk . if the ecb grossly understates the risks , its credibility as a regulator would be badly mistarnished . if it is more forthrightly about the risks , there is a chance that some periphery countries might be having difficulty plugging the holes and calling for help from the north . one hopes that the ecb would be forthright .
researchers should use fully representative test groups , while taking care to adhere to strict privacy and accountability protocols . of course , such initiatives cost money , too . venture capitalists now spend $ 3.2 billion annually on global health r & d r & d . they should expand the scale of their investment to include ai-enabled mental-health-care technologies . they could also fund competitions among socially conscious technology entrepreneurs to spur further innovation in this field .
still , a preteaching-hospital model could prove effective in public policy as well . consider , for example , the harvard university of growth laboratory , which i founded in 2006 , after two highly fulfilling policy engagements in el salvador and south africa . more than three dozen countries and regions have since been working together . in some respects , the lab looks a little like a schoolteacher and research hospital . it targets both the research and the clinical work of serving “ patients , ” ” ” ” or governments in our own circumstances .
and the u.s. had as much in common with british industrialists in terms of trade secrets like china today for american intellectual property rights . the fledgling textile mills of new england were desperate for technologies , and did their best to steal british designs and smuggle in skilled british artisans . america had patent laws , but it did protect only the interests of us citizens . as one enterprise historian put it , the americans “ “ “ “ “ pirates ” were , ” too . any reasonable international trading regime must start from recognizing that it is neither feasible nor desirable to limit policy space countries must design their own economic and social models .
making all of these changes in the future will be difficult , if not impossible , . but if the world moves in this direction , something along the lines of the new conclave of political global power will begin to take shape , as well as for the beginnings of a new international system . the second great change – ie , the end of the global ideological distribution – also raises difficult , and possibly more complicated issues . there exists today a basic , even on the occasion of a ritualistic , consensus about the notion that democracy and human rights are the passing points for political organization with some form of open markets with varying degrees of privately owned social responsibility as the foundation for economic activity . yes , one may debate on the third way or a half way or the other , but these essentially marginal debates .
it would offer returns close to those yielded through equity investment , but with some risk offsetting its longer-term nature . the risk would be mitigated further by participating large , influential investors , including sovereign-wealth funds , pension funds , and perhaps international financial institutions . public contributions , likely backstopped by multilateral lenders , would provide projects with something close to sovereign-risk profiles . finally , the regulated nature of cash flow would enable better predefined reentry structures than traditional private or public equities can offer . developing bhe would require a new platform of private-sector investment , structured to provide bespoke returns to its diverse players .
capital inflows , which will doubtless grow in the coming years , are being driven largely by investors ’ interest in diversification and high yield , rather than by the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s image as a sanctuary from troubled financial markets elsewhere , particularly given that china ’s financial markets are relatively underdeveloped and beset by significant risks . to be sure , some foreign central banks have signed currency-swap agreements with china , and even hold small amounts of their currencies in their reserve-holding portfolios . but those actions may be less a sign of the renminbi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s inevitable march toward global dominance than a low-cost bet for its likely emergence as a widely embraced international currency . and countries ’ desire to maintain good ties with china , owing to its rising economic might not be discounted . depending on how soon china opens its capital account and develops its financial markets , the renminbi could become an important buffer currency in the near future .
the peasants in guerrero cultivate amazpola for cartels , not for their own livelihood . and the american drug-enforcement administration will not look kindly on any backtracking from previous mexican presidents ’ commitments to pursue an expensive , bloody , and futile war of drug choice in mexico . there are , of course , other issues on the us-mexican agenda , ranging from intelligence-sharing and counterterrorism to regional crises , such as venezuela , nicaragua , and possibly cuba . amlo will almost surely maintain mexican cooperation on the front set of issues , while retreating to mexico ’s ’s ’s own traditional and archaic anti-interventionist posture on regional diplomacy . but trump cares more about security than done about venezuelan president nicolás maduro , or nicaragua ’s daniel ortega , so the true rupture may be avoided .
in 2015 , enabled by a new constitution , burundi ’s deposed president pierre nkurunziza , won a third term , amid violent protests . that same year , similar protests erupted in the democratic republic of congo , following the enactment of a bill that would enable president joko kabila to prolong his tenure . the au should demonstrate leadership in this area , pursuing interventions that buttress constitutional democracy along the lines of its agenda 2063 . the au has defied military coups in the past . denounces his success in sudan must stand against “ constitutional coups ” conducted by presidents , because it establishes itself more firmly as a force for peace and democratic governance in africa .
higher birth rates in the us , the united kingdom , and france reflect large numbers of immigrant families in individual countries . moreover , fertility rates among immigrants are typically higher than in native europeans or northern american families . but increasing numbers of immigrant workers wo n’t necessarily raise birth rates . germany , for example , has a large guest worker population , but few settle there with its families ; most are leaving its children in its homeland . an aging population is contributing to europe ’s poor economic performance .
there were , of course , no consequence whatsoever for cheney . the news barely made a ripple in america 's media . impunity , indeed , is widespread – indeed , most corporate crimes go un-noticed . the few that are being noted typically end up with a slap on the side of the christ , with the company – meaning that its shareholders – picking up a humble fine . the real culprits at the top of these societies rarely need alarm .
greene found that people had asked to turn a moral judgment about “ personal ” violation , like pushing an outsider off a footbridge to nowhere , showed increased activity in brain-related areas . this was not the case for people asked to make judgments about a relatively “ impersonal ” violation like hurting a switch . moreover , the minority of subjects they considered it would be right to press the foreigner off of the footbridge took longer to reach that verdict than those who said doing things would go wrong . why would our judgments , and our emotions vary in this manner ? for most of our evolutionary history , human beings – and our primate forebears – had live in small groups in which violence might be inflicted only in up-front and personal manner by battering , pushing , strangling , or applying a stick or stone as a club .
in today ’s ’s more complicated legal environment , it takes years to negotiate trade deals with the eu and then other partners . political uncertainty is high , and there is little prospect for a general election to resolve it anytime soon . investors have every reason to take a wait-and-see attitude . in 1949 , britain discovered itself on par with a trade deficit vis-à-vis the united states and weak investor confidence . in september of this year , sterling was again devalued again , as it did 18 years earlier , by more than 30 % .
once in power , erbakan tempered his tune and conduct . turkey went on to allow the u.s.-led " operation provides a comfort " against iraq to use turkish bases . it remained a vital nato member . relations with israel indeed improved with more visits by ranking turkish officials than at any time in history -- a move orchestrated by miller but embraced by refah . in fact , power led refah to compromise , rather than extremes .
new york – in 1893 , the playwright george bernard shaw , an ardent proponent of women ’s suffrage and equality , wrote mrs. warren ’s occupation , a play whose title character is the proprietor of a couple of brothels . playing justifies her costly exploitation of the business of prostitution from an old feminist standpoint . the play is not salacious , and it includes no coarse language , but it was nonetheless eight years before it could have been staged . its opening in london in 1902 was staged in a little-noticed theater “ club , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ostensibly restricted to members . its performance in new york in 1905 was raided .
nairobi/paris – africa is on the brink of an unemployment crisis portending profound economic , political , and social ramifications . but the crisis may turn away , and one solution might be just as simple as turning on the lights . each year , some 13 million young people are looking for work in africa , but only around three million find jobs . the continent ’s youth population is projected to double by 2050 , to 840 million , and yet africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s schools and universities do not yet make enough graduates with the technical skills to succeed tomorrow . although the african development bank ( afdb ) hopes to generate 25 million new jobs within a decade through its youth employment in africa initiative , there is no immediate clear sense of where these opportunities will come from .
they have failed to reckon that the palestinian people possess dignity and national pride , just like any other nation , will insist on being dealt with accordingly . let us be clear : the two-state solution does not entail accommodative the illegal realities of israeli settlements ; rather , it implies ending this colonial enterprise . refusing to mention a two-state solution , trump ’s statements ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s team move in a different direction , more in line with israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s official position : one state and two systems . but no palestinian , arab , or responsible international leader would ever accept this design , as was evident in the messages conveyed by world leaders to the trump administration . now the plans are afoot to advocate a future for peace and security in the middle east ” through the us-polish conference in madrid , where the palestinians are not going to participate .
in any case , this is not as if avoiding talking about israel is a departure for sanders . despite having commented about the matter where it is essential , he has generally not been outdone on issues concerning the country . he has certainly never embraced israel as a political cause , as many other american jewish politicians possess . nor does israel seem to figure out very much in its own jewish identity , which is more tied to the memory of the holocaust than anything else . sanders is no different from many other american jews in this regard .
king salman has embraced trump ’s war against terrorism and anti-iran rhetoric , by expressing support for an israeli-palestinian peace . nothing has been said of human rights , much less of women ’s rights , and the word “ democracy ” never passed trump ’s lips . instead , trump has completed a $ 110 billion deal in advanced weaponry to saudi arabia that in turn will invest heavily in the american economy . the agreement appears to have become the foundation of a brilliant new friendship , between the world ’s oldest democracy and its most repressive islamic regime . for trump , like president calvin coolidge , america ’s chief business is business .
because gold was $ 400 an ounce in both years , holding gold did nothing to compensate for the plunge in the value of the us dollar . a japanese investor holding dollar equities or real estate could instead offset the exchange-rate loss by buying yen futures . the same applies to a euro-based investor that would not have gained by holding gold but could have offset the decline in the dollar by purchasing euro futures . in short , there are better ways than gold to hedge inflationary risk and exchange-rate risk . grexit , or its equivalent of other governments , provides safe inflation hedges , and explicit currency futures can compensate for exchange-rate risk .
munich – because china pegged its now-undervalued currency , the renminbi , pegged to the us dollar , each weakening the dollar in the wake of america ’s financial crisis also implies weakening the renminbi against other world currencies . but is china really supposed to be blamed for the eruption of the global currency war ? south korea ’s central banks , brazil , taiwan , japan , singapore , and many other countries are now buying us dollars to defend their own currencies against revaluation and thereby try to defend their exports . europe has also become nervous after the euro ’s exchange rate has risen to more than $ 1.40 , well beyond america ’s purchasing power parity ( ppp ) tariff of $ 1.17 . the united states is currently taking drastic steps against china and imposing provisions for a trade war .
but while such sources may yield valuable insights , they fail to meet the norms of methodological rigor and conceptual clarity about which informed public discourse should underpin . for these reasons , researchers , media and civil-society organizations need to gain broader attention . it is critical that we develop an internationally recognized set of indicators and methods to track income and wealth . government statistical agencies should publish the income and wealth levels of the top 1 % , on average , between 0.1 % and 0.1 % , as well as the effective taxes paid by these groups . to this end , a particularly important milestone will come with revision , because over the next three years , the united nations national accounts system .
eliminating federal health-insurance subsidies under the us affordable care act ( “ obamacare ” ) would save the us government slightly more than $ 100 billion annually , roughly 3 % of us federal expenditures . but there are a large part of those subsidies for their own devoted taxes . moreover , trump and congressional republicans are learning that replacing obamacare is easier said than done . health-care reform , as hillary clinton might put it , is fearsomely complicated . there is a growing sense that the name changes ( “ trumpcare , ” anyone ? ) , and one might expect the republican plan covering fewer people ; but much of the substance remains to be done .
during cardoso ’s tenure , he privatized telecoms , a national mining company , and a part of the electric sector . inflation fell , but unemployment , public debt , and urban violence all rose sharply . heightened social inequalities were heightened , and last year brazil endured blackouts and electricity rationing . from the beginning of the campaign , lula showed strength , particularly after the right ’s favored candidate , roseana sarney sarney , crashed and burned when federal police and prosecutors discovered a cash load in her husband ’s office . mr. and ms. ended up absolved through all charges , but not soon enough to rescue her candidacy .
in case , you would think that people who receive such a windfall would spend it on alcohol , gamblers , or prostitution , an independent review showed that they do not . give directly ’s cash transfers a boost to recipients ’ food security , intellectual health , and assets . at $ 450 million , one could also purchase 180 million bed nets , enough to help protect the 271 million people from malaria . ( for all of these interventions , the numbers are probably somewhat smaller , because the charities are not designed for such large sums , and so do n’t take into account that costs rise as soon as those with the easiest to reach have met . ) when a person chooses to purchase a “ salvator mundi ” rather than to restore sight to nine million people , what does they say about their values ?
at the same time , mail managers will run incoming messages and facebook , linkedin , and other requests as specified by the recipient and collect credit cards from senders ( or , more often , its paypal accounts or navigate other payment systems as they emerge ) . the recipient is not likely to see complexities ; much of this will be handled in the wake . to start , you can simply fix your price at , say , $ 1 , coupled with a list of people who might reach you for free . there would be a lots of glitches at the start , beginning with those you know who have multiple email address , the old friends not on your present white list of free reign , and so forth . but such challenges would lessen over time , and , as less mail getting sent , a higher proportion of it would want and respond .
in business and immigration , for example , bannon ’s acquired philosophically aligned philosophy with trump ’s own political opportunism ( trump ’s ’s ’s ’s more liberal , often democrat-backing former self is yet another story ) . it was a mistake to see bannon as pyrrhic to trump ’s ’s ’s galatea , or , as some have done , as trump ’s white house rasputin does . bannon reinforced the nationalist inclination that led trump to overrule his daughter , ivanka , and his economic advisers by withdrawing from the paris climate agreement . and bannon ’s intruded on foreign policy by being thrust upon the national security council for some time , up to a point until two of trump ’s generals – national security adviser , h. r. mcmaster and john kelly ( now the chief of staff ) – got him off . ( bannon was believed to have been behind the recent push to force out mcmaster , mostly by suggesting that he is “ anti-israel . ” )
they mistrust one another with too much left to interact . meanwhile , demand in most of europe remains weak , ruling out the economic growth required to service debts and offer hope for an estimated 25 million unemployed . parochial suspicion was a major impediment to a grand solution . no country ’s taxpayers wanted to feel paid to others ’ excesses : the single currency did not impose shared responsibility . thus , creditor countries , led by germany , sought to do the minimum necessary to keep europe alive , while borrowers grumbled impotently about germany ’s insistence on fiscal austerity .
the cheap credit ushered in the european fed ’s inflationary economic bubble in southern europe , which burst when the financial crisis hit . the credit terms deteriorated abruptly , and what departed was an thoroughly overpriced rump of economies that became excessively reliant on foreign financing . the french economy , in turn , suffers because its customers in southern europe are in trouble . according to a study by goldman sachs , france would have to depreciate by about 20 % against the eurozone average and by about 35 % vis-à-vis germany , restoring malal-debt sustainability . the ecb and the international community , in particular , have been trying to cope with the crisis by substituting a dearth of private capital with public credit .
the same happens , even if you read philosophy , say , husserl . the author opens at the pfist page and follows a set of questions with which to see how he will achieve his conclusions . of course , encyclopedias was never meant to be read cover for cover . if i wanted to know whether it could be that napoleon met kant , i pick volumes k and cnn , and discover that napoleon was born in 1769 and died in 1821 , and that kant was born in 1724 , killing in 1724 , and died in 1804 . it is conceivable that the two met met .
letting them in might produce a better team would be our team , but it would no longer be our team . from one perspective , this is just another case of emotion defeating economic logic . but our emotions are algorithms , bequeathed by evolution , by means that we make most decisions , including a political one ; an economic cost-benefit analysis that does not link our emotional compass does not move the needle . at the heart of the issue is the sense of “ us . ” what does it mean to be an eu member , nigeria , iran , israel , or any other political entity ?
islam and democracy are frequently supposed to be bitter antagonists . a careful study of the world ’s 47 muslim-majority states nonetheless shows that islam and democracy can and should coexist . the true gap is tighter : it is the arab world , not islam , that seems at loggerheads with democracy . that conclusion emerges from a comparison between muslim countries ’ “ electoral competitiveness . ” when a government sprang out of an reasonably fair election and an elected government manages to fill the most essential political office , the country sees itself as “ electorally competitive . ”
( if anything , these standards are excessively burdensome . ) on the other side , swiss bioengineer martin fussenegger rightly observed that venter ’s achievement “ is a technological advance , ” rather than a conceptual one . other scientists noted that the organism was indeed only “ semi-synthetic ” ; ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” because a synthetic dna ( which comprises only about 1 % of a cell ’s dry weight ) was introduced into a normal , or non-synthetic , bacterium . understanding the history of synthetic biology is important because acknowledging the right paradigm has critical implications for how governments regulate it , which in turn affects potential applications and diffusion . thirty-five years ago , the american national health institutes adopted overly risk-averse research guidelines or “ genetic engineering ” techniques .
paris – with weak demand in the advanced countries now impeding growth in emerging economies , including the major players in asia and latin america , many are arguing that an era of income convergence has arrived . nothing could further be further from the truth . as i have argued before , the convergence of emerging-market countries ’ ’ ’ real average incomes , at the aggregate level , with advanced countries ’ per capita incomes is likely to continue on august 2020 . that process began in the us in the late 1980 ’s and continued unabated , with the exception of the years around the asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 . the pace of convergence accelerated further during and , just after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis : aggregate average differential in per capita income growth to more than four percentage points during the 2008-2012 period , from slightly above two percentage points in the two decades preceding .
this belief has favored the two major political parties . labour has sought to avoid a constitutional debate , because any move toward federal institutions demands that it address the party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s over-representation in the uk parliament . it is unjust for giving ever more power to the scottish parliament while pursuing labour , which controls 41 scottish constituencies in the house of commons , to say disproportionately over what happens in england . as for conservatives , the party has allowed its belief in the country ’s union ’s constituent parts to foreclose any debate about how the union can be modernized . if we are to prevent the uk from rattling towards brexit , we need to change the way we govern ourselves .
this means reaching out to public figures to request on-the-track fixes , lodging complaints with standards , and providing training to media organizations . it also means working with tech companies to identify ways to stop the broader circulation of misinformation , including across international boundaries . at the same time , fact-checking organizations should focus not simply on entering false information , but also on identifying sources of robust information and pointing their readers and followers . and we should work with schools and other training platforms to help educate people to identify fake or misleading claims . this is the approach taken by our organizations , and , as small , under-resourced as it is , the impact is already apparent .
london – one of the most dispassionate features of today ’s ’s ’s ’s international debates is that the threat to humanity posed by global co2 nuclear weapons – and by those who would build more of them , or are simply too willing to exploit them – was consigned to the margins of politics . us president barack obama seized global attention with his prague speech in 2009 , which made a compelling case for a nuclear-abolition world . and he delivered on a major new arms-reduction treaty with russia , and hosted a summit that focused on reducing the vulnerability of nuclear arms and materials to theft or diversion . nonetheless , the nuclear issue still struggles for the public ’s resonance , as well as for political traction . it would take a bold gambler to bet on ratification of the american senate ’s comprehensive test ban treaty any time soon .
it seems self-evident that an advanced economy requires adequate , ongoing investment in public goods . but the american infrastructure state suggests that many decision-makers do not share this view . a 2013 report by the american society of civil engineers gave america a pathetic total during the d + to its infrastructure . the report cited multiple state-specific flaws , including michigan ’s ’s ’s ’s “ 88 high hazard ” dams and 1,298 structurally inefficient bridges ” and the “ $ 44.5 billion needed to upgrade drinking-water systems ” in california . the report concludes that an estimated $ 3.6 trillion of investment ( about one-fifth of the country ’s annual gdp ) would be required by 2020 to boost america ’s infrastructure quality by addressing a “ significant backlog ” of overdue maintenance [ and a focus on modernization ] .
a second myth presumes that prohibition reduces the harm associated with drugs . global markets in cannabis , opium , and coca products essentially resemble other global commodities markets ; yet global drug-control policies operate on the assumption that our drug markets bear more in common with smallpox and other infectious diseases for which there is no demand . governments can act unilaterally and multilaterally to regulate commodity markets , but they are a mistake to see prohibition as the ultimate or maximalist form of regulation . prohibition , in fact , represents the abdication of the us regulation . anything that is not suppressed is effectively unregulated , except by criminal organizations .
this is for the best of reasons – fish that are caught when they are too small generates tiny yields . moreover , the fish have no opportunity to reproduce , undermining fish stocks entirely . for example , the avowed intention of the eu ’s common fisheries policy is “ to protect fish resources by regulating the amounts of fish taken from the sea by enabling the young fish to reproduce , and by ensuring that measures are respected . ” as it stands , however , we have “ fished down ” our stockpiles until few large , old individuals remain . to see this , consider the north sea cod .
official surveys insist that 86 % of russians – and typically 86 % – support him on everything from annexing crimea to his most recent term as president . but putin ’s ’s ambitions as a “ post-modern autocrat ” may be his achilles ’ achilles ’ heel . after all , autocrats often mistake their people ’s proclamations of love and admiration for the real . the truth about what people actually feel remains impossible to know . with the russian economy stagnant , owing largely to international sanctions and the kremlin countering sanctions , discontent will continue to simmer .
but it was probably in hungary , the first country to push for an imf package , that such practices were most widespread . still , this vulnerability was largely created , or at least accommodated , by western banks . funding from parent banks , which , in the earlier stages of the crisis , helped to provide liquidity to east european banking systems , now looks more like a liability and possible source of contagion . it was also the west european financial regulators and supervisors , who , under “ home rule , ” were inclined to fend off such excesses . likewise , the penetration of foreign banks was deprived of countries in central and eastern europe of the tools of monetary policy , leaving them with little control over extraordinarily rapid credit expansion .
add to that the mismanagement of ethnic and religious diversity , stir up large and growing cohorts of unemployed and digitally connected youth , and the continent offers ideal conditions for mayhem . emulating countries elsewhere , africa ’s governments responded to violent extremism primarily by placing a hard ” security first . but this strategy has failed to reduce extremist groups ’ potency or constrain their reach . in fact , there is mounting evidence that an entirely military response can be a waste of resources , or even do more harm than good . what is missing is deeper scrutiny of root causes , particularly underlying development challenges .
moreover , wherever health-care costs go to everyone – including in the us , with its public-health programs for the poor and the elderly – everybody pays the costs of treating malaria-induced health interventions . whether to prohibit cigarette crime entirely adds another question , for doing so would undoubtedly create a new source of revenue for organized crime . so far , it seems odd to hold that the state may essentially prohibit sales of a product from doing so ; but may not authorize simply to be sold on packs that carry graphic images of the damage it causes to human health . the tobacco industry will now take its battle against australia ’s legislation to the world trade organization . industry worries that the law could be copied in much larger markets , such as india and china .
the un framework convention on climate change refused to fund disaster preparedness efforts unless states demonstrate precisely how the catastrophes they feared were connected to climate change . according to a recent rand study , the united nations ’ ’ ’ disaster loss-reduction funding in 2003 amounted to some $ 127 million – just 7 % of the total invested in climate-change research of that year . climate change policies are not the best way to reduce weather-related effects . during the 2004 hurricane season , the norwegian republic – which invested in hurricane shelters and emergency evacuation networks – suffered fewer than ten deaths . in neighboring haiti , which was n’t ready , 2,000 lives were lost .
the brisbane summit ’s signature achievement was intended to leverage a just-announced us-china emissions target into the formal g-20 aid for “ strong , effective action to address climate change . ” the g-20 ’s ’s stance represents a powerful challenge to the rest of the world to reach a global agreement at the un climate change conference in paris in december 2015 . ( all of this lamentments australia ’s conservative host government , which had struggled to prevent the topic even from rising ; the australian public , however , had been amusing and promptly knocked down prime minister tony abbott ’s approval ratings at post-summit polls for this and other embarrassments . ) other formal g20 outcomes were agreements – backed by more political detail than most commentators had anticipated – to spur global growth . more specifically , leaders focused on investment , trade , competition , and efforts to bring more women into the workforce ; the fairness of the international tax system ; and how to target corruption .
if one wants to impress russian president vladimir putin or other foreign dignitaries , hosting them at such a magisterial fix as “ versailles ” will be certain to prove effective . but reveling in a country ’s monarchical history may be dangerous . many of those who voted for macron may have hoped for an analgamation . but now they may be thinking more about louis xvi , a king who has paid with his life for the faults of his predecessors . can macron learn from his errors and reclaim the confidence of french voters who felt humiliated by him ?
and that is precisely what the us economy got in the form of unprecedented fiscal stimulus and unthinkable political activism regarding the part of the american federal reserve . just as they intervened , american policymakers consulted closely with their us counterparts around the world to urge them to take stronger action . and they did , marvel at one of the most successful periods of global policy coordination in history , involving both advanced and emerging economies . for many , the global economic summit , held in london in april 2009 , marks a tipping point at a time when america ’s economy was spinning the corner . that change was so notable that many us policymakers fell into projecting a quick rebound , particularly given america ’s prior history of economic dynamism and resilience , only to be humbled by what turned out to be a protracted and complex recovery process .
fears feeds on itself and the prediction that stocks lose value becomes self-fulfilling . the recession of 2008 was triggered by the collapse of the real-estate bubble . america ’s housing wealth has since fallen by more than 34 % since its peak in 2006 and remains depressed . the us stock market has fallen nearly 50 % since its 2007 peak , and remains down almost a third . this tremendous loss of wealth created a large and persistent drop in consumption demand , leading to a surge in unemployment .
the billionaire american casino owner sheldon adelson , for example , failed to purchase the las vegas review-journal in 2015 or capture israeli money-center media . as the media landscape increasingly lends itself to capture , political and corporate accountability will only decline . this is why the center for international media assistance has just unleashed a new report shining a spotlight on the phenomenon and called solutions . free , healthy news media are vital to a well-functioning democracy . if the us is to protect itself , the former must be defended at all costs .
so far , merkel has had to deal with weak or non-existent opposition . this will make a difference very fast , particularly given the possibility of nato ’s troop increase in afghanistan . from now on , she will require a trait that she has lacked so far : management and decision-management . moreover , the victory of montenegro and yeltsin has defined an alternative : redenti, dark red , and greece . the political camps of the old – the left and the right – are back for now .
instead , we need to integrate transport , housing , and land use , encourage dependence on public transportation , and make our streets agreeable and safe for walking ( especially to women and survivors ) . the fourth challenge lies in changing how we produce , transportation , and consuming energy . this includes creating more efficient power systems and boosting our investments in renewable resources ( which , one hopes , creates jobs in the process ) . we can also encourage households to consume less energy , and companies to cut back on the amount of energy they waste . fifth , we need to reform how we govern our water resources and our water infrastructure to make this precious resource again , and in city-wide scale .
ramallah – israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu certainly has reason to celebrate . he surprises almost everyone by securing a decisive electoral victory , winning a third consecutive term in office after his right-wing likud party gained a five-seat advantage in the knesset over its central rival , the center-left zionist union . but the celebration is likely to be short-lived . manner netanyahu finagled that outcome – renouncing his commitment to a two-state solution with palestine , and pledging to resume construction settlements on the occupied land – will almost surely have serious political and diplomatic consequences for israel . netanyahu ’s hardline stance has increasingly undermined israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s international credibility in recent years , while convincing palestinians living in the occupied territories that a genuine deal with israel is impossible .
an early testing of the scale of the kremlin ’s commitment to the minsk agreement should be whether it frees up nadiya savchenko , ukraine ’s first female fighter pilot . savchenko went on hunger strike in russia for more than two months to protest her patently illegal incarceration on charges even more ludicrous than those for whom i were imprisoned . to be sure , i am hoping that the new deal will last , at long last , bring peace to ukraine . but such an outcome is unlikely , given that the deal lacks any coercive mechanism , such as automatic eviction of russia from the swift financial relocation system should renege on any aspect of the deal . simply put , confidence in the kremlin ’s “ goodwill ” would be reckless .
why waste precious work time in the air , on security inspections , and waiting for our baggage ? before anyone starts slashing travel budgets , let ’s attempt to see why we need to shift people rather than information . through a research collaboration for inclusive growth with mastercard and an anonymized donation of data to the center for international development at harvard university , we are starting to shed some light on this mystery . in ongoing work with dan bahar , michele coscia , and frank neffke , we have been able to launch some intriguing stylized facts . more populous countries have more entrepreneurial travel in both directions , but the figure is less than proportional to their populations : a country with 100 % more population than others have only around 70 % more business travel .
too many italians shrugged their shoulders in berlusconi ’s ’s lies and flaws , figuring out that he would go away at a time when he would have done little harm . but he did not go away , doing plenty of harm . simply put , americans can not afford to make the same mistake . the price of liberty , americans loved to say , is eternal vigilance . in confronting trump , there can be no discount .
and , although the government recognizes the need for broad-based reform , its approach has been all wrong . specifically , president ollanta humala has recently won legislative approval for a set of “ realistic ” practices to cut red tape perceived to hampering investment in extractive industries , the very industries on which the economy should become less reliant . a new law seriously weakens peru ’s capacity to regulate land use , establish environmental quality standards , and rein in corporate misconduct through mental-impact assessments . an peruvian government now has a serious dilemma . beyond undercutting peru ’s ’s international credibility as a “ climate champion ” – an insight that some of its government sought to cultivate – law jeopardizes peru ’s natural environment and economic-growth prospects .
fifa and the government ’s response to brazil ’s recent protests are placing themselves at risk what the paquim exhibit commemorates : the rebirth of liberty and democracy . the problem for president dilma rousseff ’s government , who has been herself imprisoned and tortured under a military regime , is that brazilians know exactly what is at stake . when pundits weigh in emerging powers like brazil and india , they typically point to the rise of the middle class and booms in education and connectivity . but they seldom appreciate the texture of their democracy and civil societies – the innately ness of hard-won freedoms , and an intimate understanding of what tyranny , whether a homegrown dictatorship or colonial one , implies for individual liberty . ( still less noticed by the role played by women ’s emulation and feminism in development . )
how , then , can nato help with this ? directly , it can do nothing ; indirectly , it can do much . nato is no longer merely a military alliance ; it can also be a nuclear one . instead , it is now a military-political alliance that sets democratic standards for new members and aspirants . no romanian government can neglect these standards .
a revolutionary delusion has crumbled , leaving behind only the contemptuous rule of the class of corrupt tycoons – effectively a mob – that bought army ’s loyalty with massive cash bonuses and lucrative oil-smuggling and drug-dealing agreements . the mobs ’s supporters have been repressed , often brutally so . in terms of numbers of political prisoners , maduro ’s ’s government has joined the ranks of china , cuba , and turkey . one might expect us president donald trump ’s administration to minimize maduro ’s repressive practices . but trump has also been quick to recognize the opposition leader , juan guaidó , as provisional head of state after guaidó , with widespread support among venezuelans invoked a constitutional provision challenging maduro ’s legitimacy .
but , so far , efforts to lower funding costs have had a limited impact . true , the weighted average interest rate on bank credit to nonfinancialized firms remains close to 7 % , while economic growth has edged down from the 7.4 % year on year in the previous three months to 7.3 % in the current quarter . still , the situation may not be dire , but it is far from ideal – especially at a time when the chinese authorities are pursuing structural reform . the pboc is now facing a dilemma . if it loosens monetary policy further – by , say , cutting banks ’ current-account ratio – momentum for restructuring could disappear ; and there is no guarantee that additional liquidity flowing into the real sector .
drafted with un resolution 181 ( which partitioned palestine in 1947 ) , such a motion would re-write the establishment of a palestinian state and a state for the jewish people based in the 1967 borders with mutually agreed border adjustments and security arrangements . while such an approach would surely fall short of a maximalist palestinian request , it would embrace the parameters outlined in may by us president barack obama . at the same time , it would indirectly address the israeli government ’s ’s ’s own demand that the palestinians recognize a “ jewish state . ” such a vote would also address multinational corporations ’ calls for bilateral diplomacy . rather than closing their doors , such a redefinition of statehood at the un would provide the palestinian leadership with a much-needed symbolic achievement , including a framework from which to restart negotiations – a longstanding palestinian demand .
given that ongoing changes in manufacturing facilities have already initiated this trend , gates and some in the european parliament have suggested that robots will be taxed to pay for human services . whether this will be the best solution is now a topic of much debate ; but , clearly , some type of compromise will have to make . at the same time , robotics and ai will raise profound ethical questions for liberal politicians , particularly with respect to privacy and safety . fortunately , there is a wider political consensus around this issue than on taxation . the european parliament has proposed a voluntary code of conduct for engineers and others working in fields such as robotics .
new york – “ everything . ” thus , goes the refrain in a famous argentine song . thus , goes the refrain in argentina in a famous argentine song . but , in argentina , all of them stays the same , or else becomes worse . heraclitus warnings against bathing in the same sea twice are being lost on us economic ministers insisting on bathing regularly in contaminated waters . whenever they go bathing , they follow the same path , first raising fears over what happens if argentina pays back its foreign debt , and then inevitably paying back its debt under intense pressure from the international monetary fund and the u.s. .
shanghai – as the current international order becomes more fragmented , robust global-governance institutions are critical to resolving the world ’s strategic , economic , and sustainability challenges . and yet rarely do our current institutions – including , first and foremost , the united nations ’ – frailer . the un is not broken , but it comes into trouble , particularly as more countries treat it as a polite diplomatic afterthought and seek solutions to major global problems elsewhere . we have seen this on issues ranging from syria to iran , north korea , terrorism , cybersecurity , security , asylum-seekers and refugees , migration , ebola , and the emerging funding crisis . while the un still has many of its own strengths , it has also clear structural weaknesses .
apparently , the decision to launch february 15 as a day of mass protest was taken at a meeting of the european social-forum activists in florence in november last year . in ninety days , those organizers reversed more than five million protestors worldwide . there are three keys to the phenomenon : the us , europe , and the us itself , are not struggling with the media . the internet has allowed for the rapid diffusion of organizational plans at an extraordinarily low cost to the organizers . mass action depended on local organizations seizing the initiative based on a leaked global plan .
how better to memorize that decision than with a building boom at your prisons ? the new money facility to which the money is devoted will house 106 prisoners ( a precise number is uncertain ) who was neither attempted nor tested . eight of the inmates are now entering the second month of hunger strikes . according to america ’s southern command spokesman , which oversees gitmo , starvation strikers are disillusioned , because they trust obama ’s pledge to shut down gitmo . indeed , they are cleared to leave , only obama ’s failure to uphold his pledge – and america ’s congress ’s inability to legislate its transfers – that keeps them there .
flows of technology and innovation : increased technology ( and knowledge ) flows between china and the rest of the world would encourage the emergence of globally competitive , productivity-enhancing solutions ; declining flows would undermine global productivity . at the same time , the world may decide how to facilitate more or fewer technology-transfer flows that are increasingly subject to safety reviews . according to our simulator , $ 8-12 trillion could be at stake , depending on the extent to which technology flows unleash innovation and drive productivity growth . it is important to note that these choices are not just china ’s ’s ’s ; the world , too , has decision-making to make . for example , by working together to reform the global trading system in ways that reinforce dispute resolution and foster inclusiveness , countries could ensure that the gains from a rising chinese ( and other ) deal are shared broadly .
whereas greece remains mired in depression , iceland – which is not in the eurozone – has essentially recovered . to be sure , as the american economist barry eichengreen argued in 2007 , technical considerations make exiting the eurozone hard , expensive , and dangerous eurozone . but that is only one side of the ledger . using iceland as our measuring stick , the costs to greece not exiting the eurozone are equivalent to 75 % of one year ’s gdp – and counting . it is hard to believe that if greece abandoned the euro in 2010 , the economic fallout would amounted to even one-quarter that .
last march , as rumors circulated that he was losing the vote , maliki asserted a threat to state security if he lost , noting his responsibility to maintain order . when he lost , he demanded a recount not as a candidate , but in his capacity as the commander-in-chief . the fact that maliki , despite his incumbency , was incapable of securing a second term just seven months after the election attests to widespread opposition to his continued rule among iraq ’s ’s political class . there is only one way to explain america ’s administration ’s decision to exert such diplomatic pressure in favor of iran ’s ’s ’s ’s own favorite in iraq : obama ’s pledge during his entire presidential election campaign to disengage from iraq during his first term in office . in this , obama follows the example set by president george w. bush , who let america ’s electoral agenda , rather than american – not to mention iraqi – national interests , dictate iraqi policy .
in its emphasis on the value of the signal , economics enters postmodernist territory . a signal – in this case , the promise to balance the books – creates the realities . people start to behave as though the books have been balanced , ignoring . when one trusts the narrative , one acts in ways that make it appear true . in fact , i do n’t believe that osborne himself has ever attached significance to the signaling effects of his pronouncements .
in response to its dwindling donor funding , the ghanaian government has brought the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s private-sector leaders together to launch the ghana malaria foundation , which currently working to fill the urgent financing gaps but will ultimately help to drive a sustainable , domestic effort to eradicate malaria out of the country . this is a daunting moment in the fight against malaria . but it ’s also a opportunity moment . for its part , novartis recently announced plans to invest more than $ 100 million in antimalarial r & d over the next five years , to help contain the emerging drug-resistant strains of the disease . our focus is now on completing clinical trials for two promising new antimalarial drug candidates .
if sunnis come to believe that shia and kurds intend to treat them like second-class citizens , they would have little stake in maliki ’s government ’s success , and again might start pursuing their own political interests through other means , provoking another surge of sectarian violence . making matters worse , factional conflict would undermine further development of a post-saddam iraq identity . alternatively , a country ’s diverse interest groups might , like lebanon ’s feuding factions , turn to outsiders to negotiate solutions to their problems . there are good reasons for iraq to avoid lebanon ’s august example . even in the best of times , lebanon muddles through with a politically dysfunctional government and an army operating in the shadow of a grand militant organization .
america ’s had trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015 – a multilateral problem stemming from a saving shortfall that can not be addressed effectively through country-specific remedies . that ’s not to say that america ’s trade partners should be let off the hook for unfair practices . but this implies limited hope for resolving apparently chronic trade deficits – and a related domestic hiring erosion to those imbalances – as long as america does not begin to save again . this plot , alas , is on the verge of thicken . trumponomics seems likely to aggravate america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s saving shortcoming in the years ahead .
throughout the arab world , the fall of baghdad on april 9th looks like a day of shame , reminiscent of june 5th of the 1967 armies of three arab countries , conquest over the west bank , gaza strip , and east jerusalem in just six days . now , arab intellectuals , and indeed the broader arab public , are preoccupied with trying to analyze and understand the lessons of the iranian earthquake . meanwhile , supporters of former ba’athist regime in iraq and elsewhere are now busily advocating for the same old , totalitarian thinking . their tactic has been to obstruct a clear review of the iraqi disaster by suggesting that any critique of saddam ’s regime is tantamount to promoting the american occupation of iraq . fahd al-fanek , a former ba’ath party member , now represents a columnist for the jordanian newspaper al-ra “ i. ”
meanwhile , a lower current-account surplus ( as a share of gdp ) could stem from its outsize investment-income deficits . and , while the recovery in the advanced economies boosted exports , persistent overcapacity , combined with slower household-consumption growth than it was in 2012 , caused investment growth , albeit still rapid , to decelerate to its lowest rate in the last 11 years . in principle , a country can run a current-account deficit or surpluses continuously for decades . but china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s chronic surpluses are problematic . given that china remains among the world ’s poorest countries , with per capita income amounting to less than $ 7,000 , its status as the world ’s largest capital exporter vicfies a gross resource misallocation .
madrid – by july 29 , according to a global footprint network of sustainability , humanity will deploy up the earth ’s resource budget for an entire year . this “ earth overshoot day ” has driven forward by an astonishing two months in the last 20 years , and will enter earlier earlier than ever . although mankind ’s ’s ’s increasing environmental impact manifests itself in myriad ways , climate change has the broadest and longest-lasting effects . carbon-dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels account for an estimated 60 % of our ecological footprint . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
the economic boom is the only source of legitimacy left behind by a one-party state . few people , even party members , still trust in marxism-leninism , let alone maoism . and widespread discontent with official corruption and political oppression was amply demonstrated in every region in china in 1989 . the communist government managed to remain in power after tiananmen , not only through brute force . some semblance of political legitimacy , particularly among an educated middle class , was bought with the promise of greater wealth .
but , owing to pressing housing and infrastructure shortfalls worldwide , this is no longer sustainable . urbanization may be leveling off in many advanced economies , but it will continue in emerging countries . the world ’s 20 largest cities , 75 % of which are in asia , will require an estimated 36 million new housing units by 2025 . moreover , in 2014 , an estimated 330 million urban households were living in substandard housing or struggling financially because of the cost of housing ; that figure is projected to rise to 440 million by 2025 . even in an advanced economy like the united states , more than 40 % of california ’s population can not afford decent housing at market rates .
berkeley – one need not be particularly good at hearing to decipher the dog whistles being applied during this year ’s election campaign in the united states . listen even briefly , and you understand that mexicans and the chinese are working with wall street to forge lousy trade deals that rob american workers of their rightful posts , and that muslims want to blow all against themselves . all of this fear-mongering is scarier than conventional election-year fare . it is terrifying those in foreign countries that may have concluded only that voters in the world ’s sole superpower have become dangerously inaccurate . and it is terrifying for americans , who until recently believed – or perhaps hoped for – that they lived in a republic founded on the traditions established by george washington , abraham lincoln , and teddy and franklin roosevelt .
put in these terms , the problem has always been solved by simply giving more to those with the most political authority . the professor nicola rossi , the economic consultant for prime minister massimo d’alema , in the title of his recent book , expresses the desire that we give “ less to our fathers and more to our sons . ” but if union unions are powerful or seniors are placed in the majority ( in italy ’s two coincide , because seniors are the majority in all labor unions ) , the exact opposite occurs . italy ’s recent budget , which neither confronted the issue of pensions nor the problem of fiscal reform , demonstrates this completely . here is the strange delusion of italy ’s budget and finance ministry in italy .
oslo – education is a human right . and , like other human rights issues , it can not take for granted . around the world , 59 million children and 65 million adolescents are out of school . more than 120 million children do not complete primary primary education , and more than half are children . beyond these figures , children and young people are being denied not just the right , but the opportunities : the fairness chance to get a decent job ; to escape poverty ; to support their families ; and to develop their communities .
small-scale farmers , both women and men , are africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s biggest agricultural investors . and agriculture-fueled gdp growth is more than twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth in other sectors . but africa ’s farmers are meeting major barriers to meeting their potential . on average , they apply less than ten kilograms of fertilizer per hectare , compared to 140 kilograms in india . moreover , less than 5 % of farmland is irrigated , and improved crop varieties are rarely used .
the question now is whether decision-makers are even prepared to make good use of them . obviously , most eu countries ’ governments are not . but why are developing-country governments dragging their feet ? are the risks so high that they provide a justification for the suffering that could have been avoided ? gm foods have now been market in the us for more than 12 years .
of the roughly $ 200 trillion found in global financial assets today , nearly three-quarters are in some form debt instrument , including bank loans , corporate bonds , and us government securities . surely , the derivatives market helps the spread risk more broadly than this superficial calculation implies , but the bottom line stands . surely , there are some good economic reasons for lenders to have such an insatiable debt appetite . imperfect information and the difficulty of monitoring firms pose significant hurdles to idealized risk-sharing instruments . but policy-induced distortions also play an outsize role .
italian exports to china currently amount to roughly € 13 billion ( $ 14.7 billion ) per year , with imports amounting to roughly € 29 billion . moreover , a partnership with china could attract the additional capital inflows that italy sorely needs , given constrained by its banks ’ lending . whereas italy obtained some € 14 billion in chinese investment since 2000 , chinese firms invested € 10.5 billion in the 55 bri countries in the first ten months of 2018 alone , signing bri projects worth more than $ 80 billion . nonetheless , there are several compelling reasons why italy should not move down this bilateral bri route with china , but rather deepen engagement with italy as part of the eu ’s 2016 strategy on china . for starters , italy ’s interests may not align with those of spain .
after years of economic stagnation and even crisis , the public ’s patience wearing thin . to be sure , many latin american leaders have , over the last few decades , ascended to power on promises of leveling the playing field . and their interventions – including income redistribution , fiscal and monetary expansion , protectionism , discriminatory regulation , and capital controls – carried some of the short-term benefits , particularly for the poor . but , so far , such measures have been met by populism , and have done more harm than good . relying on commodity revenues to fund their social-welfare programs , these leaders have failed to diversify their economies or improve economic fundamentals .
his eloquent resignation made clear that he opposed not only to syrian blunder , but to a pattern of behavior : trump ’s peddle allies and opponents ; his willingness to please friends , such as the kurds ; and his trashing alliances , like nato . mattis ’s cronies made clear in televised interviews that what most troublesome a retired four-star marine general and defense intellectual was not only that he could no longer influence policy ; it was also that his last remaining in the cabinet as protective , a position he could no longer hold . even that doughty loyalist , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , released the thursday statement that he was “ “ distressed ” by the departure of mattis ( an important sign , many believe , of mcconnell ’s private anxiety about trump ’s interference in the republican party . ) members of the us congress have expressed outright fears about a trump presidency with no guardrails . the list of departures from the trump administration is unprecedentedly long .
the government has strengthened its safety system , putting itself in place a ubiquitous system of surveillance cameras . visas are being denied to anyone active in the name of human rights , with the unintended side effects of hurting international business in china . but china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s priority is not simply to perpetuate economic growth . rather , it is designed to encourage growth while protecting its power . the regime is set to prove the world that china , again a world power , can stage lavish performance , with its voice heeded .
he will need to become an internationalist , left-leaning leader , or internationalist right-leaning . only one of those seems to represent a tenable option . traditional center-right policies would not easily align with a powerful , internationalist bent . if globalization , on its various dimensions , were to be backed by a popular majority , it would need to be accompanied by modernizing social policies that provide effective help for those in need . at a time of continuous economic disruptions , this will become all the more important .
but there is an alternative that could help to appease angry citizens and mitigate the revenue loss from an outright prohibition against metallic : electronic cigarettes . given that e-cigarettes merely heat the nicotine option for producing an inhalable vapor , they free none of the carcinogenic tar of cigarette smoke , making them the ideal nicotine-delivery system for smokers seeking – or coerced – to reduce or suspend its tobacco intake . far less damaging than cigarettes , e-cigarettes are a homegrown product , invented in china in 2003 . but , despite considerable advances in china ’s ’s ’s e-cigarette industry – in 2013 , shenzhen province housed 900 gadfly manufacturers , up from 200 % in 2012 , and accounted for more than 95 % of global e-cigarette production – traditional cigarettes still dominate the chinese market . as yanzhong kong of the council on foreign relations recently pointed out , “ if only 1 % of china ’s smoking population turned to e-cigarettes , this would mean a market of around 3.5 million e-cigarette users .
the reason un climate conferences continue to fail is straightforward : their agendas – centered on voluntary , quantitative targets – are fundamentally flawed . agreeing to quantitative , universally applied emissions-reduction targets at the un conference is straightforward . but countries automatically regard adherence to those targets as a sacrifice : in attempting to reduce emissions by x tons , we would lose y million jobs , and gdp would plummet by $ z billion . because genuine sanctions or penalty for non-compliance exist , when push comes to tency , governments can simply change mindsets . even as a government tries to authorize its commitments , say , by imposing new regulations on high-emitting industries , it might not get the desired results .
while china provides just 4 % of value added , it supplies core components to apple at low prices . apple can not build an iphone from scratch in the american system , so it would need to search for alternative suppliers , driving up its manufacturing costs considerably . this would give chinese smartphone firms an opportunity to seize markets sharing from major players . today , an estimated 80 % of global commerce comprises international supply chains . falling trade costs have allowed firms to splinter their manufacturing lines geographically , with manufactured goods and value added in multiple countries along the chains .
finance economists view such luck-based compensation as signs of governance trouble . third , a higher ceo ’s pay slice is associated with weaker accountability for poor performance . in high-ceo pay slice , the probability of ceo turnover following poor performance ( controlling for the ceo ’s duration ) is lower . the lower sensitivity of performance-based turnover reflects a less willingness on the part of directors to discipline the ceo . finally , higher-ceo pay slice tend to give his ceo some opportunity grants that turn opportunistically timed .
there is only one europe , despite its diversity . any subtler occurrence provokes repercussions across the continent . if europe is to become one , if the european union takes in its new postcommunist democracies -- in the interest of all europe -- a number of vital tasks must be undertaken within new democracies as well as among euro-atlantic communities . to start , europe needs to foster a community in ex-communist countries by rebuilding civil society . for a living society can not be restructured from above .
the eu and the us must remain firm and united in their policies toward russia . this approach offers the best chance for bringing an end to the current confrontation , and compelling russia to engage constructively with the west . of course , if cooperation is to work , russia must earn back the trust it has violated , demonstrating its commitment to abide by the treaties and international norms of behavior toward which it agreed . when it comes to russia today , appeasement will not lead to peace ; on the contrary , a conciliatory approach will merely prolong the conflict . the sooner the west convinces russia ’s leaders that it will not back down , the sooner the conflict will end .
nine times out of ten , nothing really serious will happen – mere distress for individuals or groups . but we are running a tenth time risk … now . today , greece ’s european creditors seem ready to abandon their solemn pledges on europe ’s irrevocability to insist on dithering some crumbs away from the country ’s outright pensioners . should they press their demands , forcing greece into exit , the world would never again trust europe ’s longevity . at a minimum , the eurozone ’s weaker members would undergo heightened market pressures .
it is certainly preferable for a plutocracy in which wealth determines status or a gerontocracy , in which age guides one of the top , or even an aristocracy , in which what counts are inherited titles and properties . thus , meritocracy seems preferable , at least at first glance . but , on closer inspection , things are less straightforward . for many , france has long been the epitome of meritocracy . most of those at the very top reaches of not only the civic service and the judiciary , but also the politics , entrepreneurship , and academia have used to be graduates of famous grandes écoles .
at america ’s ’s ’s most elite universities , for example , only around 9 % of students come from the bottom half of the population , whereas 74 % come from the top quarter . most societies recognize the moral obligation to help ensure that young people can live up to their potential . some countries are even imposing a constitutional mandate for equality of educational opportunity . but in america , more is spent on educating rich students than on educating the poor . as a result , america is squandering some of its most value assets , with some of its young men – bereft of skills – switching to dysfunctional activities .
the au has now threatened sudan ’s ’s new rulers with suspension unless it transfers power to civilian authority . even if sudan ’s military leaders succumb to the au ’s pressure , however , political stability is far from guaranteed . for decades , le pouvoir has used oil revenues to buy relative public quiescence through a massive subsidy . but those reserves were concentrated in the south , and were thus lost when south sudan ’s seceded in 2011 . and , now , political stability is gone .
istanbul – the call for ensuring adequate , nutrient-rich food to an expanding global population is a daunting one , particularly in light of constraints on key resources like water and farmland . as it stands , the two leading approaches to enriching and enlarging the world ’s ’s food supply are genetic engineering and industrial processing with additives and chemicals . a third solution is now emerging : vertical farming . academic studies have found that locally cultivated vertical farms – stacked greenhouses that use man-made light to grow crop plants – can provide substantial savings that could then pass along with consumers . but questions about such farmland , particularly of commodity crops , have persisted .
what it does make sense to them is a political issue . pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy , and politicians are loath to confront them on so vital an issue . still , we must confront squarely intergenerational questions at the heart of today ’s economic dilemmas . our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a `` generational accounting '' that assures that economic risk spreads systematically across a generation . what this implies is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to account for better for the changing circumstances facing different generations rather than making the fixed promises -- which most likely can not keep up , anyway -- of some payback in the future .
lower funding costs for government debt seem like a net gain for society , because the government then saves money for servicing the debt service and can keep taxes low . but any lower tax gains are more than offset by private-sector losses that face higher funding costs , which will invest less , in turn offshoring economic growth and thereby reduce government revenues . many steps have been taken in recent years to reinforce the banking system ’s regulation . but what is proposed now will make investment lending even less attractive , and increase incentives to concentrate sovereign risk in the banking sector . this can only aggravate europe ’s sovereign-debt problem and weaken its already meager growth prospects .
the plo has succeeded in obtaining european support for a unilateral palestinian declaration of statehood . the only obstacle remaining to palestinian leaders is the american people . when palestinians asked mitchell for assurances that an american would endorse such a declaration of statehood if talks failed , mitchell responded that such a commitment would make negotiations meaningless . instead , americans have their own vision of how to achieve the breakthrough , particularly with israel , which the obama administration believes is now a major obstacle . to effect change in israel , the americans launch various trial balloons .
the commercial calculus behind this business sometimes provoked riots until the laws of anatomy allowed the bodies of executed murderers and unclaimed dead to be applied , thereby reassuring middle - and middle-class individuals that their bodies would not be part of themselves . these old tensions assumed new dimensions as the commercial potential of human tissue seizes the entrepreneurial imagination . yet few laws go along to address the use of cell devices , tissues , and our genes . the most familiar case concerning the body as property is that of john moore , a patient who developed hairy cell leukemia and had his spleen removed at the ucla school of medicine in 1976 . his physician patented certain chemicals in moore 's blood without knowledge or consent , setting treaties , and selling privileges to the swiss pharmaceutical company to make drugs out of the “ mo ” cell line .
but the germans , undaunted by all , simply continue to celebrate one great soccer party with its newfound friends from around the world . black , red , and gold german tricolor adorns entire countries just as never before , but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones . in fact , the flags of a number of nations fly alongside germany . in berlin , as in other large german cities , taxi flags at their drivers ’ flags at home – from angola to saudi arabia – sport the flags of their drivers . fans don not only of their nations ’ ’ ’ flags , but also fanciful costume evocative of their home countries ’ “ colors . ”
in the meantime , the epidemic ’s death toll has continued to skyrocket . to stop the ebola outbreak from escalating further , relevant actors – from health workers to government officials – must once again engage with affected communities and win back their trust . fortunately , as neighboring rwanda has demonstrated , this is entirely possible . in 1994 , rwanda endured a brutal genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed in a mere 100 days . thisharrowing experience left behind property destroyed , failed states , and traumatized populations with little faith in local or international institutions.national basic immunization coverage has been less than 30 % .
at an anti-corruption summit in london on may 12 , world leaders – together with representatives from business and civil society – will have a critical opportunity to move toward this recognition . with corruption decried across cultures and throughout history , corruption is decried . it has existed as long as governments have existed ; but , like other crimes , it has grown ever more sophisticated over the past few decades , with a devastating effect on the well-being and dignity of countless innocent citizens . for starters , corruption cripples development prospects . when , say , public-procurement is rampant or royalty for natural-resource wealth is stolen at a source , or the private sector has monopolized a narrow network of corporate cronies , populations are unable to realize their potential .
the protests began when the government sought to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned a conviction by former prime minister thaksin shinawatra ’s brother and a ptp ’s ’s ptp founder who was overthrown by the military in 2006 – on charges of corruption and abuse of power . ( it also would have superseded the assassination charges brought against the democratic party ’s ’s ’s leader , former prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . ) but yingluck ’s subsequent attempt to roll back an amnesty measure failed to mollify the opposition . in fact , street-fighting has intensified , fueled by a new grievance . yingluck ’s government has refused to accept the constitutional court ’s proceedings against a bill intended to amend the senate from a half-appointed to a fully elected chamber .
new presidents from the european commission , the european council , and the european central bank will be appointed , along with a new high representative for foreign affairs and security policy . if nationalist euroskeptic parties become the largest group on the european level , such appointments could represent an equally abrupt break from the past . eu member states are more divided now than ever before , even on the most fundamental questions concerning the european project . a widely pro-european consensus of the past has been superseded by resurgent nationalism . moreover , east europeans are increasingly flocking toward the west and northern east .
freetown , sierra leone – donors like the world bank and the world health organization often urge developing countries to invest in their national health systems . but while rushing to construct clinics and other health-care facilities in even remotest regions may seem like straightforward access to ensuring universal health coverage , this has not proved true . the recent ebola epidemic in west africa highlighted the urgent need for stronger , more efficient , and more resilient health-care systems in developing countries . but , as countries rush to build more clinicians , the resulting facilities tend to be hastily constructed and lacking in facilities , supplies , and staff needed to deliver vital health services efficiently . in my frequent rural visits to my native sierra leone district , i saw more than a handful of health facilities that communities could make without .
to be sure , if wilson were alive today , he may well agree with trump on some of the issues , though his proposed solutions would be very different . wilson , for example , would probably concur with trump that the level of openness in global markets today is excessive . indeed , it is problematic that america ’s banks and firms can export capital , technology , and jobs , as they please , with little or no regard for the domestic costs . but wilson ’s ’s solution would probably focus on developing and implementing improved regulation through a european-dominated multilateral process . likewise , he would probably advocate fiscal policies aimed at advancing the common good , with higher taxes on the richest companies and households funding , say , infrastructure development , high-quality education and universal health care .
but , in march 2010 , in a move that i believed it key to our subsequent growth , i announced “ englishnization , ” a blueprint for making english our corporate language in less than two years . the goal was to lay the groundwork for worldwide expansion in an industry that was modernizing aggressively for internet-savvy talent . when i announced englishnization , only 10 % of our labor force was proficient in english . unsurprisingly , some on my team worked apprehensive ; others , particularly those outside the firm , thought that i was an act of folly . but , just seven years later , the titans of corporate japan are searching for our advice on how to build a global brand headquartered at the japanese capital .
but that would only further weaken the banks ’ ’ credit portfolios at a time when european regulators are desperate for strengthening them . the ecb ’s decision to grant banks unlimited liquidity fails to resolve governments ’ debt problems , or is its own intent . but it at least inhibits the debt problem of creating banking problems , which in turn worsens the debt problem without the end . europe has ’s second vicious spiral runs from fiscal consolidation to slow growth and a return to fiscal consolidation . tax increases and cutbacks in public expenditure continue to be required ; this reality is not entirely avoided .
add economics to this recipe , just as it does . price regulations and other ill-considered features of european policy help add up to an estimated 60 % of america ’s new drug trade in the us , compared to just 40 % only ten years ago . this sterility and inertia make europe less and less attractive to americans . so the american eyes is turning elsewhere : to china with its 1.3 billion people and an economy growing at 8-10 % , year in and year , and india , respectively , with its $ 1.1 billion people and 6 % annual growth . indeed , india now has some of the world ’s top engineers , both technicians and medical professionals .
but they are likely to die far more quickly if we suddenly come to reach contact with them , bringing with us modern pathogens against which they have no antibodies . these tribes might be isolated ; but their demise would also have serious consequences . with their realization in mind and an understanding of – nature – such groups serve as the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s environmental sentinels , safeguarding 80 % of global diversity , and playing a critical role in climate-change mitigation and adaptation . when the devastating 2004 indian ocean tsunami hit , more than a quarter-million people died across 14 countries , but the two isolated andaman tribes relying on conventional warning systems suffered badly from casualties . but , as bolsonaro ’s promises understates , indigenous societies were gunned down directly against loggers , miners , crop planters , ranchers , oil drillers , hunters , and other interlopers .
in my former professional roles , i witnessed how few others did the entry of poland and hungary into euro-atlantic institutions . i saw firsthand the eagerness and hope of their peoples at such momentous times . that is why it is so hard for me to grasp their positions today . to be sure , it is not being unreasonable when poland and hungary , whose sovereignty overwhelmingly usurped by the soviet union , are particularly sensitive to outside efforts to shape their own decision-making and have a stronger sense of national identities than other eu countries do . but rejecting the eu will not insulate them from the insecurity resulting from globalization .
no particular country or group has created international maritime law as it now exists . it is the product of humankind ’s collective wisdom , cultivated over a great number of years for the well-being of all . today , many of humanity ’s advantages depend on seas from the pacific to india ’s oceans remaining fully open . but , exactly , does this really mean ? if we distill distill the spirit that we infused into international law over the ages , and reformulate it as three principles , the rule of law at sea becomes a common-sense issue .
when perpetrators of sexual violence are called into account in high-profile settings such as the un , it will become hard for individual states to ignore activists ’ demands . to be sure , effective solutions must consider the local context . sexual violence can take many forms everywhere ; understanding its possible purpose may help predict and avoid the use of it . for example , the armed groups that use force as a recruiting tool are more likely to commit egregious forms of sexual violence than groups that recruit through other means . moreover , humans living in the shadow of armed groups with a genocidal condition have a greater risk of becoming targeted by sexualized violence – such as coercive pregnancies .
because an enlarged union becomes a reality in just two months , it is imperative to devise concepts for a cultural understanding that contributes to the successful integration of the new members . some values , long espoused by the union , should be relatively easy to convey . ten years ago , with the maastricht treaty , eu members agreed to respect the history , culture , and traditions of all of their constituent peoples . the draft constitution , which recently failed to gain acceptance in the first round of negotiations , not only promises to respect the cultural heritage ; it obliges the union to be actively protected , preserving , and developing european cultural and linguistic diversity . but europe can succeed in this task only if its various constituent cultures do not seal from one another .
if successfully implemented , this agenda is likely to reverse the global saving and consumption patterns that have underpinned large imbalances in recent years . china has a responsibility for the saving side , while america ’s disproportionately accounts for the consumption side , ultimately turning the chinese into america ’s lenders . to be sure , global saving and consumption patterns have been going through major changes since the financial crisis , with both the west and china attempting to restore internal balance . doubling average household income by 2020 – a target set at the chinese communist party ’s ’s ’s ’s 18th 18th congress in november – is likely to release $ 64 trillion worth of renminbi ( $ 10.3 trillion ) in purchasing power , with china ’s ’s ’s ’s huge domestic market gradually becoming a new long-term driver of domestic and international growth . this model presupposes that china will develop domestic capital , rather than relying simply on foreign investment .
i understand reding ’s reticence – and her frustrations . i do n’t like quotas either ; they run counter to my belief in a meritocracy . but , when one considers the barriers to achieve a meritocratic ideal , it looks as if a fairer world needs to be mandated temporarily . after all , four decades of evidence now show that corporations in europe just as they are evading meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions , regardless of how much “ “ soft ” pressure ” ” they place on them . when women break through to a corporate-power summit – as , for example , sheryl sandberg did recently in facebook – they garner massive attention precisely because they remain an exception .
new delhi – in 2009 , as i competed in india ’s last parliamentary election , i was a rarity . i was not a professional politician , but one that . by contrast , all other candidates in my constituency – indeed , a majority of contenders all over the country – had devoted their entire lives to politics , many since their student days . i was not born into a political family ; i had no seat or political fiefdom to inherit ; and i entered a race without a political “ godfather . ” i did not even live in india for decades , having spent my adult life working abroad for the united nations .
ultimately , however , the experiment failed . the fdp abandoned talk out of frustrations , as its leader , christian lindner put it , “ the four discussion partners do not have a common vision to modernize the country or a shared foundation of trust . ” even without a jamaica coalition , germany still still has a stable liberal majority in the bundestag . the same can not be said for the rest of the eu , where nearly every member state today constitutes a “ 50-50 society ” : one-half of a cosmopolitan , half communitarian . in those countries , the government at any given time represents whichever side wins the latest round in an ongoing culture war .
for starters , all countries need to define the crime of online child trafficking and incorporate it into their national penal codes , coupled with tough penalties for violators . likewise , all of the recruitment , advertisements , and financial transactions associated with online child trafficking should be criminalized . raising awareness about the topic is also crucial – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – where illiteracy , poverty , and age-good sex education in schools , can leave children even more vulnerable . parents must build trust bridges to ensure that their children feel able to open up about their difficulties . faith leaders , too , should educate and sensitize their followers .
moreover , communities need to increase access to contraception and another sexual-health service ; one way to do this would be to revitalize or establish youth-friendly spaces and centers where information can be shared widely . such spaces should be open after school , and for weekends , staffed with knowledgeable , sympathetic adults . specific attention needs to be devoted to rural regions and to those with specific needs , a often-overlooked youth segment . guyana ’s ’s ’s young people are critical to improving life prospects . if more teenagers have access to sex education and contraception , fewer girls will have their livelihoods severed through pregnancies .
many are lower-income workers who would otherwise be unemployed . this suggests that stronger economic – and therefore job – growth would reduce the labor force that is engaged in independent work . but , whatever macroeconomic conditions may be , independent work tends to account for a rising share of work in the long run , owing to technological advances and individual preferences . while digital independent occupational platforms remain in its early stages of development and employ only 15 % of independent workers , they are proliferating and expend fast . mckinsey estimates that 30-45 % of working-age households favor earning income , either primary or secondary , out of independent work .
the demand for abolishing censorship was one of the polish march ’s first political slogans . demands for the freedom of assembly and the right to organize followed . crucially , the protesters did not demand free elections . in this they were realists , but they demanded a measure of civic control over the authorities , both in the political and economic sphere . one slogan was “ no bread without freedom . ”
new haven – in what might well be the definitive acts of desperation , central banks are abdicating effective control of the economies they were being entrusted to administer . first came zero interest rates , then quantitative easing and now negative real interest rates – one futile attempt bearing another . just as the first two gambits failed to gain meaningful economic traction in chronically weak recoveries , a shift to negative rates would only compound the risks of financial fragility and set the stage for the next crisis . adopting negative interest rates – originally launched in europe in 2014 and now embraced in japan – represents a major turning point for central banking . previously , the emphasis was placed on boosting aggregate demand – primarily by cutting borrowing costs , but also by stoking the wealth effects of appreciating financial assets .
as a result , demand now falls short of any binding constraint . indeed , the permit price fell below € three per ton in april 2013 , rendering the emissions-trading market nearly irrelevant . this , in turn , has encouraged more reliance on highly polluting coal – the world ’s worst energy source – from the standpoint of global warming . that would not have happened had the price mechanism been steadily underpinning climate-change policy . moreover , the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s renewables policies have also proved ruinously expensive .
the task facing the imf is formidable . of course , it will be important for the fund to focus on global imbalances rather than on the bilateral imbalance . in the multilateral trading system , large bilateral trade deficits frequently strike bilateral surpluses with other countries . china might want the middle east ’s oil resources , but those in the middle east – with so much wealth concentrated in so little hands – might worry more about gucci handbags than they do in china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s massachusetts manufactured goods . so , while china may be able to run a trade deficit with the middle east and a trade surplus with america , these bilateral balances indicate nothing about china ’s overall contribution to global imbalances .
asked of their emotions earlier this year , the combined majority of americans ( 55 % ) in 2018 said that they had experienced stress during much of the day , nearly one-half ( 45 % ) said that they felt worried a lot , and more than one in five ( 22 % ) said that they felt anger a lot . stress , concern , and anger all hit america ’s ten-year highs in 2018 . the us was america ’s seventh-stressed population in 2018 less stressing than greece , the philippines , and iran , but more stressed than uganda , turkey , and venezuela . such stress measures are in line with another notable finding : american ’ self-reported happiness also declined in 2018 . asked by gallup how they would rate their life on a scale from zero ( the worst life ) to ten ( the best life ) , americans in 2018 responded with the 6.9 average , down from 7,0 in 2017 and 7.3 during 2006-2008 .
a written code – emphasizing the commercial advantages of ethical doing business – and the negative implications of falling short – are part of this effort , and may help to preserve and foster a culture ; but a code on its own is not enough . constant reminders and repetition are essential , and we are all essential . staff must understand instinctively what might be done , and what should never be done . they must internalize a culture that places firm adherence to high ethical standards of behavior . to this end , banks should make their values and cultures integral to their hiring , firing , and championing decision-making .
islamabad – one hundred years ago this month , women in the united kingdom gained votes ; today , most women in the developed world are shafranchised . but , in many developing countries , the opposition that british suffragettes faced a century ago , rooted in misogyny . this is certainly true in pakistan , where a general election set for july 25 provides an ideal opportunity to advocate for change . at first glance , pakistan appears progressive . the law allowed women to vote since 1956 , nearly a decade after independence from britain .
in some cases , the outcome was unexpected : some lending rates actually rose . it was supposed to follow that most central banks at their pre-crisis models – both formal models and mental models that guide policymakers ’ thinking – were badly flawed . none predicted the crisis ; indeed , in very few of these economies , there was some some semblance of full employment recovery . the ecb famously raised interest rates twice in 2011 , just when the euro crisis worsened , and unemployment rose to double-digit levels , bringing deflation ever closer . they went on to use the old discredited model , perhaps mildly modified .
but mao ’s ’s ’s death , at least , did the end of the caesarism era in china . because he had no son to succeed him , mao appointed a five-person politburo to do the job . its members , which included his nephew , mao yuanxin , his mistress , zhang yufeng , and jiang qing , his last wife , were as inept at governing like kim , but , following the cultural revolution ’s catastrophe , antagonism toward them within the army , and other state institutions was too widespread for the last . they , and a gang of four ( of whom jiang qing was a member ) were soon ousted . china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s transit from caesarism to despotism and then from marxism to capitalism made it fortunate for china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s citizens .
we in ukraine learned this truth from the harsh experiences of the communist era . although communism could , every now and then coexist with private property and at times with the private enterprise , it could never coexist with a civil society . the most fateful attack to accompany installing any dictatorship is an assault on civil society . in ukraine , freedom of speech , on the ’s fall of communism , has restored overnight . but revitalizing civil society – the many mutually complementary ways in which citizens participate in public life is a complicated task , because peoples in egypt and tunisia will soon discover themselves .
then , imagine that american intelligence agencies had affirmed that an act of aggression had actually been conducted , despite putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s denials . finally , imagine how trump might have reacted to this question . would he have called on putin to ask : what should he be done ? and would putin make another “ unbelievable ” offering ” ” ” to assist american investigators get on the downside ? even more to the point : would trump quickly invoke the principle of collective defense under article 5 of the nato treaty ?
but these outside risks do n’t make the outlook for global growth necessarily grim . after all , the baseline scenario for america continues robust growth . europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s growth could peak just above trend , just as it continues its long , sluggish recovery from the us debt crisis earlier this decade . and , indeed , china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s gdp has been showing the doubters for many years . so 2019 could turn out to be another year of solid global growth .
argued by the eugene scalia , the son of america ’s supreme court justice antonin scalia won the case against the sec in an american appeals court , dc circuit on the technicality – the sec ’s failure to conduct cost-benefit analysis ahead of time . that small victory turned to a major defeat for shareholders when the sec , rather than performing such analyses and re-proposing the rule , chose to stall . at a conference last december , i asked sec chairs shasiiro , when her agency planned to reintroduce the rule . i even offered to do the cost-benefit analysis of free . but he realized that the sec had many other items on its agenda and placed the issue on the back burner as a courteous way to say that the sec , like the heroic students at tiananmen square , had given up under irresistible pressure .
but these are not normal times , either . in fact , the fed ’s expansionary monetary policy was inadequate to stave off an american recession , even if one remains so moderate that many doubt whether it qualifies as a true animal . the european central bank ’s response was an analogous – but less courageous – problem with monetary policy than the headline inflation rate would suggest was reasonable . and , in western europe , too , gdp is now declining . in brief , major central banks on both sides of the atlantic reacted to the financial crisis but did not overreact .
when the opposition sought to challenge these inconsistencies , eck abruptly declared kibaki a winner . days later , the eck ’s head publicly acknowledged that kibaki supporters pressured him to announce the “ results ” immediately , despite clear evidence for voting rigging . shockingly , he declared himself that he did not know who actually won . the eu observers also announced that the electoral tally failed to meet fundamental international standards . elections are a disaster for kenya , but a response by the american-led international community is no less distressing .
moreover , a host of risk-pricing problems make such indicators hard to interpret . unsurprisingly , household surveys ’ ’ and corporate ’ ’ ’ ’ inflation expectations forecast actual inflation more precisely . given that market-based measures currently conflict with most other key economic data , little weight should be tied to them . it is also true that current global trade tensions have hit eurozone producers hard , particularly in germany . but it is hard for monetary policymakers to respond to imposing trade barriers .
but pharmaceutical companies continue to hold assumptions about the boundaries of the pre-competitive collaboration that needs answers . at first glance , they seem counter-intuitive that companies want to share data and potentially turn away from their competitive advantages . but this presupposes that owning such data does indeed imply a competitive advantage , and that a closed operating model is financially sustainable . the drugs that make it to market must fund the costs of failure for those that did not make it happen to markets . as recent morgan stanley has pointed out , the pharmaceutical industry ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s current success rate is inadequate to sustain large internal-r & d organizations , making the industry ’s current operating model financially unviable .
though iranian officials could most credibly deter iran from using a nuclear weapon , a nuclear-armed iran could well turn out to be a regional arms race – a nuclear-armed saudi arabia , possibly followed by turkey and egypt . indeed , nuclear arms , component , and materials in a region that is already volatile and violent , and that determined the world ’s price for oil is an appalling scenario . indeed , the market has already conducted a measure of last week ’s tensions , driving the price of some of its oil contracts to their highest levels in eight months . attempting to force iran to step in with steadily mounting sanctions has failed to yield results . despite tightening economic noose – america has imposed sanctions on all companies doing business with iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s central bank , and the european union ’s plans to impose sanctions on iranian oil exports by late january – many nuclear experts now estimate that iran is extremely close to enriching sufficient uranium to build a bomb .
this levy , strongly backed by those countries whose financial sectors are in tatters after the crisis , is hard to swallow for eu states that have not been intervening to bail out their banks . the levy is an easy way to spread the political and financial costs of a crisis from some to all eu members . if applied , bank capital would become scarcer , the credit flow slower , and bank charged higher in countries with pretty steady financial sectors , simply because others have spent the fortunes of supporting their financial systems – and because the european commission never misses the chance to reunify europe-wide rules . the same applies to the derivatives trading system . post-crisis harmonization fervor in this area means that it will now become more costly everywhere in the eu to insure against currency volatility or unexpected interest-rate changes .
at & t is offering scholarships through partner nonprofits institutions , and has provided paid internships for up to 100 graduates . learnup , a san francisco startup that attracted funding from some of silicon valley ’s largest venture capital firms , introduces partnerships with employers to offer online training modules that link job-seekers to particular jobs , primarily entry-level positions that do not require college degrees . employers foot the bill , with the expectation that learnup helps them to recruit higher-quality applicants . and , indeed , as soon as candidates complete the practice , learnup helps secure interviews with prospective employers that already comprise several large companies . the california community college system is already working with learnup to give students access to the skills required to fill available local jobs .
mohammed , the military coup that overthrew egypt ’s first-ever democratically elected president , and led to the arrests of muslim brotherhood leaders across the country , poses an enormous danger not just for egypt ’s democratic transition , but for the democratic hopes of the entire arab world as well . realizing the coup ’s passage with massive popular support serves as a sign of the enormous difficulty that the muslim brotherhood faces during its initial turn in power . president mohamed morsi ’s government was struggling to address egypt ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s inherited economic and social crises in the face of massive public expectations created by the 2011 revolution , whose protagonists sought not just freedom but also economic development and social justice . to be sure , the muslim brotherhood was also a victim of its own errors , particularly the failures of morsi and his rule in order to reach out to secular opposition , elements of which contributed to his election victory . the morsi government appeared incapable of understanding that a slim electoral majority would be inadequate , particularly nowadays .
paris – earlier this month , the trial of pascal simbikangwa , accused of taking part in the rwandan genocide in which 800,000 people were killed between april and july 1994 , began in paris . sadly , the mass killings in africa continue to take place . in south sudan , there are africa ’s fairly newest state in history , with massacres of civilians still taking place , particularly around libor town . and french military intervention in central african governments did not portend the end of severe intercommunal violence there . yet , ironically , even as such episodes continue in africa , perhaps on a larger scale than elsewhere in the world , the continent has also become a beacon of hope .
moreover , with growing concerns about america ’s fiscal policy sustainability , europe has an enormous opportunity to play an ever-larger role as the world ’s reserve currency . one shudders to think of what will happen unless europe withdraws from its current bid . surely , europe would have lost traction in the way it badly needed an american counterweight in world economic policymaking . europeans may not mind this right now ( one sees more obama t-shirts in europe than in the us ) , but perhaps not quite as pleased whether george iii comes along . luckily , europeans probably will not wait so long to move ahead again .
that implies that it was inappropriate to focus on growth so long as the deflation gap narrowed greatly – that is , up to now . the third arrow is not a traditional industrial-policy-based approach . on the contrary , it emphasizes labor-market reform , deregulation , and lower corporate-tax rates . a key component of abe ’s growth strategy is to enlarge the labor force – a major challenge , given that japanese society is aging fast . one logical solution would be to integrate more foreign labor into the japanese economy .
what is certain is that a vacuum left by sharon ’s departure from politics is all the more striking , given the images of chaos emerge from gaza that israel vacillated and the collapse of the palestinian authority before our eyes . nor will the appearance of yet another providential figure come easily . not all of the exceptional periods make their bonapartes , and this is probably a good thing ; for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions that are far from being true . history ’s natural course in the more optimistic sense is progress “ on the margins , ” ” ” but the rapid pace of technological change pushes us to expect equally rapid advances in human affairs . many in us believe that such an impossible wager can be met only with providential man , with all the hopes – and dangers – – that entails .
so , while the cameron government ’s backing for deeper eurozone integration is welcome , the eurozone can not and will not be shaped from outside and according to british interests . the uk does not have a position to block other eu member states from deeper integration , owing to most other eu member states ’ political will to push ahead . indeed , last year , ’s negotiations over a “ green fiscal compact ” fiscal compact should already demonstrate to cameron the difficulty of exercising a so-called national veto . still , the uk has played a leading role in designing key eu policies , including measures relating to the single market , overseas development aid , trade , and climate change . uk leadership in these areas was badly appreciated – and sorely missed should the british decide to leave .
but they will fault the us from not comprehending the larger war . it is already clear that the obama administration did n’t know what it had been in bargaining for when , without thinking about what to come next , called in 2011 for assad ’s removal . in july of this year , robert s. ford , america ’s ambassador to syria , was dispatched to the sunni town of hama , where assad ’s father ordered a massacre 30 years earlier . according to the us state department at that very moment , the visit ’s point was to “ “ [ voice ] our deep support for the right of the syrian people to assemble peacefully and express themselves . ” had the administration really failed to foresee that assad – like his father before him – would have reacted to a popular violence uprising ?
beijing – after years of intervening to manage the renminbi ’s ’s exchange rate against the dollar , china ’s central bank , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) , is under pressure to float the currency . but striking the right balance between loosening its grip on the exchange rate and maintaining monetary stability will not be easy . all students of economics learn the mundell-fleming model , under which an economy can not sustain a fixed exchange rate , free capital mobility , and an independent monetary policy simultaneously . when a country with a fixed exchange rate and an open capital account hurtens of monetary policy to contain inflation , rising domestic interest rates give market participants an incentive to borrow against foreign currencies and to convert it into domestic currencies for domestic investment . the resulting capital inflows , if persistent , would generate currency pressures , forcing the central bank to maintain exchange-rate stability , intervening by selling the domestic currency , particularly american dollars , until interest rates and money supply returned to their old levels .
america ’s presidential candidate , hillary clinton , has a more targeted proposition : a 15 % tax credit for the profits that companies distribute to their workforce over two years . by providing temporary tax relief , the scheme would help companies compensate for the governance costs of setting the profit-sharing program . to cap costs and prevent abuses , profits totaling more than 10 % on a worker ’s top-ten wage would be excluded ; the overall sum offered to individual firms would be capped ; and safeguards against wage substitution , raises and other benefits . tax credit could also foster changes in the corporate culture , by rewarding body-level debates not only for price-sharing benefits , but also for sharing information and decision-making authority with employees . america ’s stagnant incomes are undercutting that of consumer-led economic growth ( by discouraging household consumption ) and supply-side side ( through the adverse consequences of educational opportunity , human-capital development , and innovation ) .
most russians see no connection between prosecution of key figures and the authorities ’ credibility . on the contrary , people seem to identify with putin ’s message that the establishment is finally tackling corruption . but it is the message to russia ’s mushrooming elites . and that message is straightforward : nobody is safe from prosecution , even though – like abyzov and ishayev – has retired out of public services and no longer influences . moreover , selective repression has become harsher .
it has also backed a successor to the commission , a high-level expert group on measuring economic performance and social progress . last week , at the oecd ’s sixth world forum on statistics , expertise , and policy in incheon , south korea , the group issued its report beyond gdp : measure what counts for economic and social performance . the new report emphasizes several topics , like trust and insecurity , that were addressed only briefly by mismeasurement of our lives , and explores a few others , such as inequality and sustainability , more deeply . and it explains how inadequate metrics have led to deficient policies in many areas . better indicators would have exposed the highly negative – and perhaps protracted – effects of a deep post-2008 downturn on productivity and well-being , in which case policymakers might not have been so enamored of austerity , which lowers fiscal deficits but decreased national wealth properly .
seventy-three years ago , john maynard keynes thought about financial markets ' reform and regulation from an vantage point of the first three purposes , and found himself stepping toward .... mak [ ing ] purchasing an investment permanent and indissoluble , such as marriage … . he promptly drew back : the fact is that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is ‘ liquid ’ ( though this can not be true for all investors collectively ) calms calms calms and makes him much more willing to run for risk … ” moreover , for keynes , “ “ [ t ] play a game of professional investment ” is intolerably dull and over-exacting to anybody who is totally exempt from a gaming ) . it is for keynes , moreover , for keynes , “ “ [ t ] play of professional investment ” is intolerably dull and over-exacting to someone who is completely exempt from gamblers ; so ilst , having it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll … ” ( ” ) . it is for these reasons that we seem frozen for past generations , or two whenever we contemplated reforming our systems of financial regulation . and it is why even in the face of severe financial crises , we remain frozen today .
perhaps the most outrageous example is america ’s $ 0.54 per gallon of import tariffs on ethanol , whereas there is no revenue tariff on us oil , and only about $ 0.5 per gallon of gasoline tax . this contrasts with the $ 0.51 per gallon of subsidy that america ’s firms ( a huge portion of going to a single firm ) receive on us ethanol . thus , foreign producers can not compete unless their cost is $ 1.05 per gallon lower than that of american producers . enormous subsidies meant that the u.s. became the world 's largest ethanol producer . yet , despite this enormous advantage , some foreign firms may still make it into the american market .
the results have not only shaped the conflict between america ’s federal legislation and state legislation ; they have also signaled a shift in attitudes not dissimilar to that related to same-sex marriage . just as importantly , us president barack obama ’s reaction to colorado and washington votes – the two states that he won readily in his reelection bid . the legal and political challenges that implied are no minor matter : marijuana remains an illicit substance under america ’s federal legislation and the international conventions that america adopted . on other issues , – notably , immigration – obama rejects the claims of states ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ rights , and insists on the federal authority . moreover , the topic remains highly sensitive : while metro polls in 2012 indicate for the first time a tiny majority in favor of legalization , opponents remain vehement .
the outcome was catastrophic , as the ethnic rivalries sharpened . whatever else said about such french-backed authoritarian regimes , hindsight leaves little doubt about the benefits of social stability seen at the ivory coast during the period of the 1980 ’s , when france remained paternalistically engaged with its former colonies . the political upheavals of 1999-2000 gave rise to a new “ democratic ” constitution , which became an invitation to civil war . regional and religious tensions were mounting since houphouet ’s death and was aggravated by a new constitution that enshrined ethnic discrimination . some four million northerners were denied political participation or land ownership on the grounds that they were offspring of migrants from neighboring countries .
these are highly educated people who know that knowledge is power , have a clear agenda , and take care that education in europe is the responsibility of national governments , not of brussels-based institutions . these governments want to establish an educational system by which the state itself determines which fields of research are indispensable and socially . in the long term , they probably also want a state to grant political loyalists the right to produce and transfer knowledge . in other words , access to knowledge stops being a civic right . political artifacts determines who can teach and study what about a country and its past .
dubai – globalization , as many recently noted , is in retreat . for all of its undeniable strengths , it has bedeviled governance problems and governance that expose the inequities created by national governments and international institutions . this has left people everywhere , rich and poor alike struggling to cope with challenges – from failed states to failing banks , from over-fishing to under-employment , from climate change to economic stagnation to which globalization has contributed but can not address effectively . fragile institutions have given rise to a political backlash and risk catastrophe on many fronts . mark leonard , the director of the european council on foreign relations , and vice chair of the world economic forum ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s new global agenda council on geo-economics , note that interdependence , formerly the economic quagmire , has now turned into a threat as well .
london – for two decades , chinese diplomacy has guided the concept of the country ’s “ peaceful rise . ” today , however , china needs a new strategic doctrine , because the most remarkable aspect of sri lanka ’s ’s ’s recent victory over the tamil tigers is not its overwhelming nature , but the fact that china has provided president mahinda rajapaska with both its military supply and the diplomatic cover it needs to prosecute the war . without that chinese backing , rajapaska ’s government would have neither the nor the determination to ignore world opinion in its offensive against the tigers . so , not only has china become central to every aspect of the global financial and economic system , it has now exhibited its strategic effectiveness in a region traditionally outside of its own orbit . on sri lanka ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s beachfront battlefields , china ’s “ peaceful rise ” came to an end .
should spain break up and gipsic countries defaults ; germany alone would lose some € 545 billion , almost half of the aggregate sum mentioned since the bundesbank conducted most of the net payment in the name of gipsic countries that revert to the target balances . germany has the biggest exposure by far among countries to save the eurozone ’s crisis-stricken countries , thereby helping to alleviate austerity more than any other eu country . george soros underestimates the risks that debt mutualization poses for europe ’s future . when alexander hamilton , america ’s first treasury secretary , mutualized national debts in 1791 , he thought that this would cement a new american nation . but the mutualization of debt gave rise to enormous moral hazard effects , encouraging states to borrow excessively .
hong kong – looking back on 2016 , there might seem little to celebrate . from the point of view of global health on its own , the year emerged as one of an unrelenting tragedy . beyond hospitals in conflict zones to be bombed , the zika virus has emerged as a growing threat . antibiotic-resistant proliferation has also occurred , or “ “ “ “ superbugs ” , ” the continuing revival of yellow fever , and the reemergence of polio in nigeria that had previously denounced polio-free . hopes for a respiratory syncytial virus have been dashed .
when it comes to securing equity in banking , these precedents and existing institutions point the way forward . at the same time , history shows us that financial exclusion is a persistent problem whenever universal service demands are absent . during the new deal era , regulators included the functional equivalent of such a requirement in banking charters and thrifts . but those mandates were removed during the wave of free-market deregulation in the 1980s , and banks moved quickly to shift away from cheap financial services and toward higher-profit-profit-oriented activities . this dynamic can be seen in the trend toward bank consolidation and the branch of closings , which has accelerated since the 2008 financial crisis and reduced access to services in low - and middle-income communities .
after all , the israeli government not only authorized the supposedly unapproved outposts to exist ; it also provided them with respect for water , electricity , the internet , and military protection . this was not lost on all of america ’s leaders . in april 2014 , then-us secretary of state john kerry told the american people ’s congress that direct talks between israel and palestine had gone bust when israel announced 700 new housing units for israelis in the west bank . by december 2016 , obama allowed the un security council to vote on that trump-derided resolution declaring israel ’s settlement construction a major obstacle ” to a two-state solution . it is not difficult to imagine what palestinian negotiators had to feel as driving the massive israeli settlements onto territories they worked to include in an independent state .
new haven : throughout europe and america , men in the black bind and women in kenzo and armani gowns are once more summer pilgrims to places like bayreuth , glyndebourne , and glimmerglass . then again , too , there is a temptation for state coffers to subsidize these privileged retreats . perhaps then there is also time to ask once again a fundamental question : should the state continue to ladle out generous subsidies for such elite pursuits ? consider a thing of incontrovertible beauty and spiritual depth : roman catholics high mass . does its grandeur mean that the state should subsidize it ?
so a crucial characteristic of foreign-policy integration is that governments can not know in advance what they are letting in for . when defense and warfare take place , unpredictability includes opportunities for young men dying from action . this is not surprising , therefore , that foreign-policy integration has failed to deliver much progress . this contrast underlines the fact that the great achievements of eu integration have occurred in that no-man ’s – a land that lies between full national autonomy and the total loss of sovereignty in a federation . but foreign policy , as we have known it , is essentially a manifestation of a nation or a superpower .
the us faces a funding shortfall of $ 100 million for a new school year . without additional aid from the international community , our vision will fail to realized – despite strong political will and rigorous planning . lebanon often struggles to attract financing due to its status as a middle-income country ; but that label is misleading , because it fails to account for the serious structural weaknesses that predate the syrian crisis or the vast share of the resident population composed of syria , palestine , and iraq live in abject poverty . one thing that i hope will become clear at the oslo education summit is the need to help middle-income countries plagued by fragility and conflict . i am thankful to us donors from early on , but we now need additional international aid .
what does this tell us about human nature and our ability to live either prudently or ethically ? part of the problem , of course , is that we make our resolutions aimed at doing only things that we are not likely to do otherwise . only an anorexic would resolve to eat ice cream by least once per week , and only a workaholic resolve to spend more time ahead of tv . thus , we use the new year 's day to try to change behavior that may be the most difficult part of any change . that , in turn , makes failure a noticeable possibility .
a second conclusion to be drawn from the current situation is that the fed has now overappreciated the strength of the american economy for 11 consecutive years . elementary math dictates that a credible prediction should at least overstate the length of half the time , and undershoot at half the time . if every year of fed forecasting were a kind of coin toss , we would now have an eleventh heads in a row and no zero-sum tails . the odds that could happen are one in 2,048 . clearly , the fed needs to take a deep view of its forecasting methodology and policymaking processes .
any study that seeks to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is being over-diagnosed finds that some patients with the condition do not have it through re-interview . such is the nature of the imquity of the imparts of the imperfectly trustworthiness of psychiatric diagnosis . the question , then , is not whether some patients earlier given a diagnosis seem to have it out of again conversations , but rather how many . how high the percentages should be before they claim that over-diagnosis is an important problem and value judgment . but we think that a over-diagnosis rate of more than 50 % crosses a clinical significance threshold .
in many previous banking crises , this was a country or region hit hard ( argentina , japan , etc. ) . this time , virtually every economy suffers substantially , and a banking crisis is global . policymakers will continue to throw out whatever ammunition they can find at the problem , but it will take time for deleveraging from the boom to run its course . at a time of severe economic hardship , policymakers thrash out seeking solutions , and some people are losing confidence in the economic system itself . indeed , during the great depression of the 1930 ’s , it was common for western intellectuals to turn toward communism and central planning as hoped-for panacea .
washington , dc – steve bannon ’s expansive travels in europe this year have n’t drawn as much attention as they should have , given that he is america ’s crucial theoretician of us president donald trump ’s signature brand of nationalism . bannon now wants to build a pan-european federation . and yet , one wonders how an “ america first ” ideologue can pursue his own political project anywhere else in america . by joining forces with french far-right leader marine le pen – herself an open proponent of russian president vladimir putin ’s campaign – bannon seems to hold in mind a new kind of “ neo-nationalist . ” just as more countries transform themselves into “ nationalist autocracies ” and “ illiberal democracies ” under strongman rule , nationalism has come to resemble an ideological common denominator .
one notorious incident in the late eighteenth century was lord macartney ’s mission to the imperial court of china . macartney refused to harass on chinese imperial protocol by dropping to kowtow to the emperor because he was not obliged to do the same thing to his own sovereign . this , too , was very much the case for preserving face ” : the chinese had anticipated tribute ; the british lord insisted on the equal status of his king . as a result , the mission has broken down . diplomatic immunity from local prosecution was an idea that sprung straight from another incident almost a century earlier , involving the arrest of the russian aristocrat , andrey matveyev , who represented peter the great in london .
if not , a loss in the bond price would do more than wipe out the extra interest that it has earned , even if rates remain unchanged for five years . here ’s how the arithmetic works for an investor who rolls over ten-decade bonds over the next five years , thereby earning 2 % more each year than he would do by investing in us treasury bills or bank deposits . assume that ten-year bond interest rates remains unchanged over the next five years , and then rise from 2 % to 5 % . during those five years , the investor earns an additional 2 % every year for a cumulative gain of 10 % . but when interest rates on a ten-year bond rise to 5 % , the bond price falls from $ 100 to $ 69 .
only the world ’s political and economic heavyweights , the major industrialized countries that remain by far the world ’s largest co2 consumers , can start to change globally . change must start with the transportation sector , which accounts for more than half of all current oil consumption – a share that is likely to rise in the future . thus , the g-8 countries should agree to no longer license any new , oil-powered cars from 2025 onwards . such a decision would not be directed against individual mobility , but against the dissipation of a scarce resource that is all the more urgently needed to make synthetic materials work . political leaders should not privilege any particular technology .
ithaca – us president-elect donald trump has managed , yet again , to turn the facts on his head . as part of a broader effort to take china to task for supposedly “ raping the united states economy ” through unfair trade policies , he has now renewed his charge that the country has manipulates its currency to shore up its exports . statements like these are just as dangerous as they are unmoored from reality . make no mistake : trump ’s accusing chinese currency manipulation does not back the facts . on the contrary , over the past two and a half years , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) intervening in currency markets for the other purpose : to prevent the renminbi from falling too sharply against the us dollar .
new delhi – late last month , when two indian states and national capital held to ransom by rioting mobs protesting their spiritual leader ’s conviction on two counts of ratifying minor girls , many indians found themselves confronting a handful of painful truths about their country . a leader who spurred these protests is gurmeet singh , one of the more extreme “ godman , ” or self-professed spiritual leaders who flourish across india . flamboyant , jewelry-bedecked singh calls himself baba gurmeet rahim singh insan – a hindu compound , muslims , and sikh names , followed by the word for “ “ human ” in hindi , punjabi , and urdu . and he has a reputation for being sexually exploiting his female followers . in 2002 , two adherents mustered the mettle on press charges .
by contrast , some american policymakers continue to believe that iran would abandon its enrichment program if only the european union imposed unilateral sanctions . but an clear-headed analysis by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’s behavior indicates that eu sanctions would lead to more trade diversion , with china , russia , turkey , or dubai benefiting from reduced european exports to iran . to be sure , some imports would become more expensive for iran , but the economic effects of such sanctions remain limited . politically , ahmadinejad surely would not miss the chance to take advantage of unilateral action for his propaganda purposes – – – – – – – claiming that iran has a conflict not with the international community , but with imperialist states intent on depriving his country of technological advances . for these reasons , europeans favor a new security council resolution , even though its measures are weaker than what the united states or the eu could impose unilaterally .
no one could identify more closely with the political elite than abe could , the grandson of a wartime cabinet minister , and later prime minister , as well as the son of a foreign minister . still , he does share right-wing populists ’ own hostility toward liberal academics , journalists , and intellectuals . postwar japanese democracy was influenced in the 1950 ’s and 1960s by an intellectual elite that consciously sought to distance japan from its wartime nationalism . abe and his allies are scrambling to quash that influence . his effort to revise japan ’s ’s ’s pacifist constitution , restore pride in its wartime record , and discredit “ elitist ” mainstream media , such as the left-of-center newspaper asahi shimbun , has made him the praise of donald trump ’s ’s former strategist , stephen bannon , who hailed abe as abe ’s chief strategist , before trump .
ensuring high-quality output and local consumers ’ loyalty requires keeping their workforces happy and maintaining a positive public image . african countries , on the other hand , often see the worst sides of multinational companies : power , mineral , and precious metal companies go where resources are , not where they ’s comfortable working . as one former mining managers in the region told me , “ the goal has always been straightforward : get assets out of the ground and out of the country as cheaply and with as little fuss . because customers are abroad and there is very little processing to do in countries , why should companies upgrade local capabilities or otherwise help the host economy ? but sub-saharan africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s potential relationships with global corporations need not be so constrained .
the first great town to boom was london , beginning in 1996 . a boom mentality spread to los angeles , new york , and sydney around 1997 to paris in 1998 , to miami , moscow , and shanghai in 2001 , as well as vancouver around 2002 . these and other cities were pretty much ever booming ; indeed , prices in most were up at least 50 % in real terms since 2000 . this was a huge windfall for homeowners , but it hurt anybody planning to buy . now growth in home prices is faltering in some of these cities .
the government employs a host of new law prescriptions , a shadowy internet police force , and a potent hardware-based national information filtering . control also relies on internet users ’ demography , most of whom belong to china ’s economic elite and tend to embrace the internet as part of newfound consumer lifestyles than as an instrument of a political or social revolution . what is astonishing is that the government ’s surveillance mechanisms have been largely effective . but they are also fueling profound social changes , rooted in rising social consciousness within a society , something strengthened -- and compounded -- -- not only through economic growth , but by the rapid diffusion of the internet . after more than two and a half decades of market-oriented economic reform , chinese citizens are increasingly aware of how to protect their economic and social interests through the linguistic context .
this european polity lacks a second crucial element of madison ’s scheme : diversified political representation on the federal level . individual nation-states , regions , and normative interest groups are represented within the eu . but , while common european causes arise daily , they do not have much europe-wide political representation . no single political party or politician in brussels can claim to represent european citizens ’ respective interests , because none has to compete for europe-wide public support . as a result , nationally elected representatives are responsible for making crucial eu-level decisions .
is there much more , indeed , that one might ask for a us president ? and yet america ’s presidential campaigns generally neglect discussing advisors or intellectual influences . although a president ’s ’s ’s ’s advisers might make a difference , one thinks candidates would acknowledge them , if only to indicate where their own thoughts come from ; after all , realistically what they are sold is their capacity to judge and administer expertise , rather than their own abilities as economists do . this time , too , did not even mention any deep economic thinker ’s name or any particular economic model . obama originally had a marvelous team of economic advisers , including lawrence summers , christina romer , the austan goolsbee , and cass sunstein .
for another , they will need to make their own , distinct contributions . simply put , they can not wait for america to move ; nor can they always seek to placate washington ’s preferences . in short , they will need to craft their own efforts to sustain collective efforts . what this distinct contribution could be done is not hard to define . after all , only the ingrained habit of playing second fiddle to american diplomacy prevents eu members from clear and loudly distancing themselves from israel ’s repressive monary to the west bank and gaza , even as such an attitude would help to reinvigorate the commitment of arab states to a coalition against terrorism just as it provides a worthwhile gear for american diplomacy .
one reason for doing so is that small numbers of patients make studying illnesses and test drugs difficult . as a result , medical professionals often know very little about the symptoms and biology of these illnesses . earlier this year , i participated in a rare disease day program in california . the topic was an obscure but large collections ( more than 70 ) of illnesses caused by a particular type of genetic error – one that takes place in the cell machinery that chemically attaches sugars to proteins and lipids . little is known about what produces the mutations that give rise to such congenital disorders , and therapies exist for just a few .
markets become rigged , justice becomes transactional , and politicians sell themselves to the highest bidder . in time , this “ corruption culture ” sips society . in ukraine , even universities are being undermined : degrees regularly buy and sell . while corruption is more a symptom than cause ukraine ’s problems , the corruption culture must be uprooted before conditions can improve . one might assume that this simply entails a strong state , with the means to root out corrupt politicians and businessmen .
nor should anyone expect a moratorium on settlement expansion , which can be expected . on the other hand , settlements offer cheaper housing than are available in israel , thereby solving one of the country ’s major economic problems . “ red lines ” ” in israel have a means to mutating into lines drawn in the sand that are then rendered invisible at little august . the new government ’s ’s ’s fragile equilibrium only reinforces this sobering interpretation . in israel , obama will encounter a country that has indeed moved , but not toward a missing center .
as a result , in japan ’s postwar history , the fiscal ratio fell below 50 % . if the us government continues along this path , many expect next year ’s budget deficit to widen further . despite japan ’s weakness in its fiscal position , the jp government bond market ( jgbs ) remains stable , at least for now . japan experienced a similar experience in the 1990 ’s , the country ’s so-called “ lost decade . ” at that time , japan ’s budget deficit soared after a country ’s real-estate bubble burst , triggering economic stagnation .
the mugabe regime has been committed outrage after outrage . its catalogue of crimes includes : the stolen of the 2002 elections that has allowed mugabe to hold to power ; torturing and murdering supporters of the opposition movement for democratic change ; the transformation of a fertile , prosperous , prosperous country once deemed africa ’s breadbasket into an area that more than half of the population barely survives on alien food handouts ; and , exemplified by its assaults on the everyday press , suppress critical voices . yet zimbabwe ’s neighbors , particularly those in south africa , have defended president mugabe . in late august , heads of state from 13 members of the southern african development community ( sadc ) , including mugabe and president thabo mbeki of south africa , a leading regional power , met in dar es salaam , tanzania , to consider the challenges ahead of them . among the 54 davos of the summit final communiqué , two dealt with zimbabwe .
a 2014 pew study found that whereas only 25 % of respondents satisfied with the direction of national politics , 60 % were satisfied with governance within their own communities . and the american constitution permits individual states to function like what justice brandeis described as laboratories of democracy by experimenting with innovative policies without putting the rest of the country at risk . there is a long and rich history of successful experimentation . state and local governments were leaders in establishing public primary and secondary education systems as well as state-owned colleges and universities . california , wyoming , and other us states allowed female students to vote – an example that encouraged passage of the nineteenth amendment ( shafranchising any adult woman ) .
should higher nominal ( that is , inflation-fueled ) growth substitute for debt-driven growth ? europe needs to aim for sustainable , non-inflationary growth , and competitive job creation . the current annual inflation rate of 0.3 % is attributable to the sharp decline in commodity prices and painful but unavoidable adjustment of costs and prices in peripheral countries . only greece currently has a slightly negative inflation rate . in other words , price stability reigns in the eurozone .
thus , record-high speculative prices probably caused bunker traders to loosen inventories , but those releases may have been bought by speculators who are now active in lessees capacity for commercial storage . the implication is that speculators may drive up prices and hijack their inventory holdings , even as total business inventories remain little change . additionally , oil-market speculation may have fueled “ echo ” speculation , ” whereby ultimate users buy refined products in an effort to protect against future price hikes . they then hand on their premises in order to ensure that overall refined inventories rise , but that elevation is not part of the reported commercial inventories . proving that speculation is responsible for higher prices is always hard , because it tends to occur against a backdrop of strong fundamentals .
but the two states lack the domestic revenues needed to sustain their institutions . if they are willing to survive well in the coming century , they are likely to have to be subsumed under the union backed by a larger , stronger , and more established nation-state . moreover , the disintegration that the region has already witnessed – and will undoubtedly continue to witness the – – – – – – will reverberate beyond the arab map with the creation of a sovereign kurdish state . such a state , whether exisiting de facto or with widespread formal recognition , will have an increasingly lasting impact on the boundaries of the arab world ( syria and iraq ) and the broader middle east ( turkey and iran ) . the arab spring has overthrown some regimes , if not others .
we tend to think that new risk-management products , such as novel types of insurance or financial derivatives , will primarily interest the rich or at least the relatively affluent . indeed , new risk-management products are currently being developed for some of the world ’s poorest people in africa , asia , and latin america . it is important to recognize that between year and year , the world ’s poorest people are not identical people . good fortunes and a bad fortune alternate randomly , and the poorest people are particularly vulnerable when adversity – like a hurricane in a fishing village – strikes . so risk management , by smoothing out income bumps , can be particularly important in alleviating the effects of poverty .
that disconnect is nothing new ; there have always been tsars and serfs , politburo commissars , and the proletariat . that postcommunist boris yeltsin , however , even though he has sometimes declared allegiance to a hazy collective sense of rossiyane ( citizens of russia ) , deprived – or freed – – it ’s a matter of view – russians of all collective life ; both of the true life of shared hardship and the imaginary half-life of communist solidarity . today , all deals with life and hardship individually ( a new word in our daily vocabulary ) , regardless of any kremlin desire to make life uniform . indeed , nowadays , even russia ’s uniformity is different . indeed , in novgorod , i saw luther oil ( one of russia ’s ’s ’s big private oil company ) gas stations .
greater international cooperation would maximize immigration ’s economic benefits . but , despite the potential benefits of cooperation to control illegal immigration , most countries , including the us and the united kingdom , are trying to reform their immigration laws unilaterally . they view cooperation as infeasible , given the natural competition between destination and source countries for their most productive workers . a new system , in which irreversible bonds would replace quotas and desirability screenings , would mitigate such competition while mitigating the risks to destination and source countries . reversible bonds would operate as an insurance mechanism for both parties ; shielding destination countries against fiscally motivated immigration ; and protecting source countries against the costs associated with the loss of talented workers .
at the same time , every downturn eventually comes to an end . the mark of good politics is that it succeeds in making the downturn shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been . mark the stone of the austerity policies embraced by many governments is that they make the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary , with long-run consequences . real ( inflation-adjusted ) gdp per capita is lower in much of the north atlantic than it was in 2007 ; in greece , the economy shrank by an estimated 23 % . germany , a top-performing european country , has recorded badly erly 0.7 % on average annual growth for the past six years .
warsaw – twenty-five years ago this month , poland ’s peoples were stunned by the choice of their compatriot , cardinal karol wojtyla of cracow , as pope . some were horrified ; others wept with joys . here , a prominent writer said to have been “ poland ’s second christendom . ” but , even amid our euphoria , we failed to anticipate how much a new pope would make a difference not only of poland , but of the world . his first return visit to his homeland soon afterward showed to all of the world a new pope ’s great power .
though hong kong ’s courts surely might have handled the issue on their own – under the “ one country , ” two systems ” framework , hong kong is reassured by an independent court system besides the right to choose its own legislature , which has been enraged by china . restraint , after all , is not a leninist virtue . in an extraordinary move , china ’s national people ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s congress standing committee went in order to “ make clear to the article 104 of the core law , ” declaring that all oaths taken by office-holders must be “ solemn , accurate , utter , and sincere . ” yau and leung were barred from taking their seats at the legislative council . to most hong kong ’s lawyers , a show of political authority was not merely a reinterpretation of old rules ; it was a move toward making new ones .
prodded by groups like the worker rights consortium and the ethical trading initiative , some corporations promise that they will pay their living wage , open their factories to monitors , and even give their workers a voice in the workplace . re-ebok , a transnational sportswear firm , advertises its corporate code as “ built on the core principles ” of the un ’s universal declaration of human rights . the company markets its deputy soccer balls and other goods with an “ guaranteed : manufactured without child labor ” label . but the sensitivity of human rights did nothing to staunch trade unionism ’s worldwide decline . the international labor organization reports that unions are in retreat in most nations .
new york – the united states has already made its next logical step . its securities and exchange commission requires companies that use tantalum , tin , gold , or tungsten in their products to investigate these raw materials ’ origins , and to mitigate risks in their supply chains consistent with oecd guidance if they are found to originate in specific conflict-affected or high-risk areas . the 12 member countries of africa ’s 12 member countries at the great lakes region have committed themselves to similar mandatory requirements of due-diligence . that is as it should be . responsible sourcing is a duty , not an option .
they will conclude that they may have it both ways , maintain the advantages of economic integration without losing its ability to infringe on their citizens ’ rights or use eu financial transfers to build patron-client relationships , and reinforce their hold across the state . illiberal cee nationalists like hungarian prime minister victor orbán are fond of saying that they are advocating a defense of national sovereignty from bureaucrats in brussels . cameron ’s initiative plays right in hand , allowing orbán and his allies in neighboring countries to declare anathema any move toward ever-closer union and the strengthening of federal authority and legitimacy . the truth , however , is that cee countries have little to lose in the way of sovereignty . most of their productive and financial assets are privately owned by foreign companies , just as most of the rules governing their economies were determined by the eu .
systemic crises in food , fuel , and finance that hit headlines in 2008 – and this persists in many countries – have their roots in an economic paradigm that has not accounted for the value of nature and its array of life-supporting services . as a recently released report “ towards a green economy ” report : pathways to sustainable development and poverty eradication ” show , a market economy as currently under consideration has resulted in an unprecedented misallocation of capital . true , deep and pervasive market-based failures in carbon emissions , biodiversity , and ecosystem services – accelerate ecological risks and environmentally good cities , undermining human well-being and social equity . this is why the links to governance and institutions at rio +20 are just as important to driving the green economy : markets are human beings that require rules and institutions to guide not only their direction , but also their limits . one concern among critics is that the shift toward a green economy will essentially monetize nature , exposing global forests , fresh water , and fisheries to the profit-seeking behavior by bankers and business leaders whose flaws have helped to trigger the financial and economic turmoil of the last four years .
third , as usual , israel has charged anti-semitism to those who dared criticize its disproportionate reaction to hamas ’s ’s indefensible rocket attacks and to its collective punishment by the palestinians . an italian cardinal who admittedly spoke intemperately has been charged with using the language of holocaust denial . by that standard , does my unqualified critique of hamas ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s rocket attacks make me an islamophobe ? coincidentally , the lethal assault on gaza came at a time when america ’s clutch ’s most distinguished would-be middle east peacemakers have published books on how the issue should be properly tackled . it all sounded a little like a series of job-app careem – the war for president barack obama ’s ear .
a similar political imperative lies at the heart of the sinhalese chauvinism that made a sudden return to public life in sri lanka . the religious and ethnic passions of the sinhalese were emboldened during the last , bloody pressures that ended sri lanka ’s two centuries of civil war with the tamil tigers of 2009 . but , instead of seeking reconciliation with the tamils following their defeat , the then-president , mahinda rajapaksa , has continued to play on ethnic hate as he subverted sri lanka ’s secular democracy . rajapaksa ’s ’s unexpected defeat by the grand coalition of sri lanka ’s ’s ’s democrats and tamil political parties in last january ’s presidential election , an outcome that he then sought an annul – should have ended both his career as well as race-baiting politics . but the former president is now mounting a furious comeback bid , and could well win a parliamentary election scheduled for august 17 .
these are not isolated examples of children caught in the crossfire ; this is what will happen when classrooms becomes the actual targets of terrorists who see education as a threat . ( indeed , boko haram has been literally translated to signify a “ spurious ” or “ west ” education being forbidden . ) in at least 30 countries , a concerted pattern of attacks by armed groups is taking place , with afghanistan , colombia , colombia , pakistan , somalia , sudan , and syria among the worst affected . such attacks expose with stark clarity that gives education little more than blackplanks , books , and curricula . schools all over the world , from north america to northern nigeria , now require security plans to ensure school safety and provide confidence to parents and communities .
more scholarship opportunities for refugees and more funding for schools within and outside refugee settlements would also be welcome . modest seed financing can go a long way toward helping refugee-owned enterprises get off the ground . meanwhile , some companies and organizations – including wework , unilever , and gavi – develop innovative approaches to recruiting refugees . global organizations are tapping into tech-savvy refugees and hiring them for online work . some , such as tent , encourage companies to hire refugees , and integrate it into the supply chains where they live .
that is why it is increasingly being rejected in favor of the agro-ecological model based on the principles of food sovereignty . the latter approach , endorsed by the un human rights council , calls upon farmers to share their current knowledge and seeds with one another , as well as to protect local ecosystems . next month , representatives from more than 190 countries will meet in august el sheikh , egypt , for the fourteenth meeting of the parties conference to the convention on biological diversity ( the un biodiversity conference ) . while there , they will consider whether to press the brakes on gene drives , to ensure that smallholder farmers and indigenous peoples are fully consulted before such technologies are unleashed in their communities . one hopes that the international community will uphold its obligation to protect food supplies , just as farmers ’ rights have been given to farmers worldwide .
it is not at all clear how long venezuelan ’s ’s hugo chávez actually was dead before his passing was officially reported . purchasing time to secure his own political future , venezuelan officials have carefully stage-managed chávez ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s illness and eventual death , even suggesting near its end , while undergoing complicated and agonizing cancer treatments that he is still “ walking and exercising . ” the information vacuum was reminiscent of the secrecy surrounding stalin and mao ’s deaths , and the practice of keeping the sultan ’s death a secret for weeks , until the succession was settled . the mise-en-scene manipulation surrounding chávez ’s death appears certain to translate into electoral support for his gray successor , nicolás maduro . but will this suffice to create a chávista lineage ?
at the same time , governments in the developed world have a role to play in influencing the nature-based nature of technological innovations . all too often , subsidizing labor-replacing , capital-intensive technologies , rather than pushing innovations in socially beneficial directions , augment rather than substitute for less-skilled workers . such policies are unlikely to make much of a difference for developing countries . for them , a major obstacle will remain that existing technologies enable insufficient substitution room : employing less-skilled labor instead of skilled professionals or physical capital . the demanding quality standards required for supplying global value chains can not easily be met by substituting machines with manual labor .
berkeley – on january 20 , 2017 , us president-elect donald trump would take office received an almost three million fewer votes than his opponent ; working with a republican-controlled republican senate majority whose members won 13 million fewer votes than their democratic opponents . only the republican majority in the us house of representatives , led by speaker paul ryan , holds any claim to represent a numerical majority of the 55 % of americans who voted for election day in 2016 . likewise , trump would start his presidency with an approval rating below 50 % . this is unprecedented or unpresidented , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” as one of his seminal tweets put it ( before deleting it ) – in the history of such ratings . the administration of the world ’s oldest democracy , indeed , is neither democratic .
the s-400 dispute is just the latest example of how us military procurement matters has generated a rift between turkey and its western allies . in turkey ’s own view , its western partners did not do enough , through technological transfers and joint-manufacturing regimes to accommodate its burgeoning defense-serving industry . in contrast , the chinese , and , to a lesser extent , russian firms have been more responsive to such turkish demands as part of the latter ’s military-industrial procurements . and domestic deflationary interests are only part of the story . more broadly , both turkey and the west are experiencing a geopolitical , strategic , and geopolitical decoupling , reflected most recently by each side ’s differing threat perceptions and alliances in the syria conflict .
underdevelopment in many southern countries that are faring badly in their struggle to remain viable in a globalizing world creates the conditions for desperate poverty , ecological collapse , and rootless , unemployed populations beyond the control of atrophying state systems . nor will we create a better world during the age of forty st century by forgetting what went wrong in the 19 th and much of the twentieth century . this is not to say that our response to the dangers emerging from the legacies of the past must be rooted in history . there is a greater imperative than ever before for innovative , forward-thinking approaches to global governance . as we embark on the still-new millennium , albeit ironically , that tomorrow ’s possible disorder might be due in no small part to that of yesterday ’s colonial rule .
in the bilateral negations with moscow , american officials offered four concrete bmd collaboration projects : · bi-national and multi-national jointly manned centers , where russian personnel can see the non-threatening nature of us and nato missile-defense activities ; · joint russian-american expert studies on how bmd might affect russia ’s own nuclear deterrent and what steps may be taken to minimize potential problems ; · expanded nato-russian theater-level bmd exercises that build upon earlier collaboration – violated by russia ’s august 2008 war against georgia – and that rehearse how deployed nato and russia can jointly defend against missile threats ; · an underlying legal framework to support these and other cooperative projects .
under these conditions , trump ’s ’s ’s biggest and boldest policy proposals are likely to run into budget constraints . he has already ruled out any changes to social welfare . his and congressional republicans ’ attempt to replace the affordable care act ( “ obamacare ” ) and rein in growth in medicaid spending have backfired . and a temporary increase in defense spending will revert to insufficient levels once this fiscal year . though the tax package that trump signed into law last december front-loaded tax cuts and is now helping the economy grow , government revenue has so far reacted much to this growth rate .
the eu has always supported a two-state solution , despite challenging demographic realities , not to mention the need to preserve the jewish state ’s identities . grant observer-state status to palestine would take off the table concerning the prospect of a “ one-state ” solution that has lately gained momentum among experts . but these sound reasons for supporting palestine ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s bid probably will not stop the eu from delivering a split vote , the reverberations that will not only echo throughout the arab world , inviting accusations of hypocrisy , while impeding european efforts to reset relations with countries in the middle east and north africa . a split vote thus undermines european interests , providing a unequivocal blow to europe ’s foreign policy in a contentious geopolitical environment . indeed , europe ’s divided attitude toward the israeli-palestinian conflict exemplifies its poor record of achieving a foreign-policy consensus .
moreover , in countries where google is criticized for blocking access to information , it highlights the information ’s absence when something is blocked – to allow people to know that it exists but can not have access to it . on the other side , every time someone in china ’s googles something and acquires a response – a product ’s good and bad points , the details of someone the government does n’t like – “ why ca n’t i get this kind of information about everything ? ” with google , people are beginning to expect the answers of everything . a kind of little kind of transparency inevitably leads to more . rather than call for an end to censorship now , the impossible dream – google is working to make that happen by eroding government control over information .
while no outcome was formally agreed upon or made public , several themes emerged from the beijing meeting . taken together , they offer grounds for confidence that it may be possible to recreate an international consensus , so long missing in syria about how to deal with the hardest massachusetts atrocity cases . first , there was widespread acceptance that the “ responsibility to protect ” ( r2p ) doctrine , unanimously agreed by the united nations general assembly in 2005 , is here to stay . r2p recognizes that sovereigns have a responsibility to protect their peoples from genocide ; ethnic cleansing ; ethnic cleansing ; crimes against humanity ; and war crimes ; that other states have a responsibility to assist them ; and that if a state is not at all without an apparent failure to protect its own people ; the wider international community has a responsibility to tread with “ timely and decisive action ” that in an extreme case approved by the un security council . true , some chinese scholars remain inclined to argue that the entire r2p enterprise , particularly its penalty for military action in exceptional times , is merely “ old neo-interventionist ” wine in a new bottle .
so the global economy should indeed think of itself as the global capitalist system itself . global integration brought tremendous benefits : an international division of labor so clearly demonstrated by the theory of comparative advantage ; dynamic benefit such as economies of scale and surging innovations from one country to another made less easy for evidence of static equilibrium theory ; and noneconomic benefits like the liberty of choice linked to international movements of goods , capital , and people and the liberty of thought . but global capitalism is not out of trouble ; we need better understanding these better if we want the system to survive . by focusing on these problems , i am not trying to belittle the benefits of globalization . those benefits , i believe , can be sustained only by deliberate and steadfast efforts to correct and contain the system ’s flaws .
trump was portraying the report ’s findings as utterly exonerating him ( “ “ “ no collusion , no obstruction ” ) , despite the report explicitly saying that this was not the case . worse for trump , widely admired mueller in effect in recommended that the us congress commit to the impeachment process . mueller explained that a controversial us department of justice policy , intended to help president richard nixon , bars trump from impeachment by sitting president . this is neither in the us constitution nor the rule of law . ( nixon was an unindicted co-conspirator in watergate burglary , whereas trump is one in new york case involving his participation in pre-election payoffs to silence two women with whom he sex liaisons shortly after he died in his son , barron . )
russia ’s alleged “ peacekeeping troops ” in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgian ’s other secession-minded region , actually protected its insurgent governments . likewise , russia was enforcing an all-out georgian trade embargo in the hope of weakening the resolve of its pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili . should russia recognize abkhazia ’s independence , saakashvili might be tempted to respond militarily in order to prevent his country from unraveling . renewed conflict in abkhazia would not only raise the risk of open warfare with russia , but strain relations with armenia , owing to close to the 50,000 armenians in abkhazia who support the breakaway government . another risk in southern caucasus is that russia ( with armenian backing ) will recognize nagorno-karabakh ’s self-proclaimed independence from azerbaijan .
europe needs to make progress on its initial opportunity if it is to seize the second , and that means strengthening the eurozone . on this front , macron has already offered ambitious proposals : distinct eurozone budgets , a eurozone finance minister accountable to it , and a europe-wide parliament ( composed of members of the european commission and national parliamentarians ) to hold finance minister accountable . before germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s new new coalition government was forged , a franco-german working group was established to reconsider macron ’s own proposals . now that merkel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s new new administration is , we will know how far germany is prepared to go in promoting greater eurozone cohesion . in the short run , a new government seems unlikely to endorse macron ’s proposals in its present form .
moreover , the recent establishment of two other large mdbs – the asian infrastructure investment bank and the new development bank , established by the brics countries ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) – will contribute further to a more balanced public-private mix in development finance . likewise , the financial crisis has prompted some european , african , and asian governments to establish new capabilities and other countries to expand theirs . as a result , total ndbs ’ total assets reached roughly $ 5 trillion in 2015 . today , they are an important feature of the most developed - and middle-income countries ’ ’ ’ financial sectors , notably in china , germany , india , and south korea . and large ndbs can have a major impact , particularly in emerging-market economies .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . as i stressed earlier this year , the conservatives ’ plan would essentially solve one large problem – the rundown from britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s diplomatic services diplomatic services shape by creating a much larger problem : losing britain ’s ’s ’s soft power .
so , what should the american and other us governments support liberal democracy do now ? the answer could affect egypt ’s own political future , and that of countries throughout the region . as many commentators have pointed out , from islamists ’ standpoint , morsi ’s removal looks strikingly like the algerian military ’s overthrow in 1992 ( with us backing ) of an elected islamist government ; iran ’s ’s “ soft coup ” coup in 1997 ; when it forced an elected islamist government out of power ; and the american government ’s reversal of its support for “ arab democracy ” after hamas won elections in gaza in 2006 . if the choice of the islamists remains one of bullets or ballots , bullets might now look more promising . more broadly , military interference with civilian politics , for whatever reason , is weakening the processes , institutions , and checks on state authority that make liberal democracy work .
in the early 2000s , rwanda and ethiopia , for example , recruited and trained thousands of such workers to lead the fight against malaria by educating communities on prevention and detection , distributing tools like bed nets , and administering cures . as a result , from 2000 to 2015 , the incidence of malaria dropped by 75 % . yet the world persists in undervaluing the capabilities and contributions of frontline health workers . this not only undermines their capacity to do their job efficiently ; it also puts them at significant risk , with widespread misinformation about vaccines , for example , fueling strikes against those provided by them . consider pakistan , where hardline clerics and militants view tb-vaccination programs as western ploys to sterilize and spy on muslims .
once the potential “ military threat ” posed by the soviet union vanished in thin air , successive waves of nato enlargement served neither a military nor an ideological rationale . the west ’s rationale for enlargement was geopolitical : bringing the former soviet republics and the socialist states of central and eastern europe into the west spheres of political and economic influence . initially , nato ’s ’s new members were declared to meet both democratic and military criteria . later , these criteria were abandoned when nato began to invite even the most backward and corrupt states to join . moreover , nato not only enlarged its membership ; it also transformed itself from an anti-communist defense alliance into an offensive grouping ( with operations in yugoslavia , iraq , and afghanistan ) .
ironically , this led the imf to concentrate its oversight role . so , in searching for the causes of the imf ’s current default failures , we can rule out a distraction by taking more urgent issues . normally , the fund expects problems to originate in the usual suspects – economically volatile developing countries – – but this time , a few miles away from its head . perhaps that proximity came at the root of the imf ’s failure to interpret the evidence right under its nose . if it does , it is a failure that raises two key questions .
it is a shift that raises a major question : if those who are prepared to demonstrate incapable of doing so successfully , ” ” ” ” what will happen to global stability unless those who remain able also remain ready to take action in the first place ? at the crossroads of this question stands nato , an organization perceived as american by europeans and internationally ( i.e. , not american ) by an average american citizen . but if nato is – for better or worse – in command on the ground in libya , it is the un that has given the necessary green light to french action there . it is this particular “ “ marriage of reason ” between france and the un that is essential to understanding the french position on libya . indeed , the same relationship between france and the un that led france to oppose nato intervention in iraq in 2003 has now pressed france to intervene in libya in 2011 .
but if that hour were really a lunch with a lobbyist , then they ( as well as their aides ) would have to lie knowingly to hide it . of course , there is no method for enforcing full disclosure , but , by creating explicit processes and expectations , we are hoping for reset norms . if an official encounters with an anti-retrovirist and does not shy enough , he can simply say so . in fact , voters may be able to shape their own judgments . and , if an official meets , mostly with lobbyists , to the detriment of other kinds of appointments , voters may be able to make judgments about that , too .
and there is the risk that the us tech giants will use their sprawling armies of programmers to develop an almost identical product and their extensive regulatory resources to defend it . big tech firms might argue that all of the capital they pour into new products and services is driving back innovation . but , in many circumstances , one suspects is that in many circumstances , the bud ’s potential competition . it is notable that big tech has still captured most of its revenues from its firms ’ ’ ’ core products – for example , apple ’s iphone , microsoft ’s office , and the google search engine . thus , in practice , potentially disruptive new technologies are just as likely to be buried as nourished .
historically , both us state and federal attorney general generals seem preferred to prosecute “ occasional ” merchants who stick with polano thumb . for example , when a diminutive italian bank received from someone who had never traded a large command for american shoe shares shortly before the company gained an italian eyewear maker luxtica , it was not hard to smell a fish . in other words , precisely because occasional merchants rarely traded , it is far easier to prove the causality nexus between their trades and the irish ttip . on the other hand , identifying a problem when a person makes hundreds of trades on a daily basis is far more difficult . in rajaratnam ’s case , opportunities for establishing such links have emerged through telephone surveillance .
at the same time , african girls are disproportionately vulnerable to hiv contracting . approximately 90 % of the world ’s pregnant women and children with hiv live in africa ; and , despite notable reductions in hiv transmission rates , adolescent girls still spend more than twice as likely as boys to carry the virus . yet , barely a third of young africans know how to stop hiv – yet another reason for urgent and comprehensive sexuality learning . another epidemic afflicting african women is the violence ; all too often perpetrated with impunity . for starters , sexual violence is used as a war tactic .
new york – many historians and economists insist that we live in an age shaped by the great , impersonal forces . the actions and decisions of one man or woman , regardless of how powerful , can not define nations ’ destiny . this may or may not be true in much of the time . but there are moments when an individual leader ’s choices may be changing the course of history . that has certainly been true in russia and may soon turn out to be true in turkey as well .
as i show in a new peer-review paper , even if successful , an agreement reached in paris would cut temperatures in 2100 by just 0.05 oc . with the rise in sea levels , it would cut sea levels by just 1.3 centimeters . this might seem startling : we constantly hear how each country has made important commitments to cut carbon emissions – the so-called “ nationally determined contributions ” ( indcs ) , ” or the indcs . according to the un climate chief executive , christiana figueres , “ “ the indcs have the capacity to limit the forecast temperature rise to about 2.7 ºc by 2100 , by no means enough but much lower than the estimated four , five , or more degrees of warming projected by many prior ” . figueres has suggested that the paris agreement will have slashed to nearly 2 ° c of warming , from 4.5 ºc to 2.7 ° c. although her formulation has been crafted to avoid actually saying this , predictably , what most people have heard .
anti-euro political forces are clearly making electoral inroads and will continue to gain ground , as long as growth remains anemic and unemployment remains high . meanwhile , the eu will most likely pursue substantial policy or institutional reforms in the near term , owing to fears that doing so could adversely affect the outcome of consequential elections this year in the netherlands , france , germany , and perhaps italy . an alternative view holds , of course , that brexit , trump ’s election , and the rise of populist and nationalist parties serve as a wake-up call to spur europe toward broader integration and growth-oriented policies . this would require eu policymakers to move away from the perception that every eu country has solely responsibility to get its own house in order while upholding eu fiscal , financial , and regulatory commitments . upholding eu rules is no longer practical , as the current system imposes too many constraints and contains too few effective adjustment mechanisms .
russians realized that they did n’t have to win at all costs ; they could be great without the kremlin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s militaristic say-so . after that , the pension reform was announced , spurring a string of protests that drove putin ’s pledge to soften the measures , while appealing to russia ’s ’ understanding of them . yet , as of september 3 , 53 % of the population said they were ready to object further . and , on september 9 , while local government elections took place , tens of thousands of russians joined the protests organized by the anti-corruption lawyer and opposition leader alexei navalny , defying the prohibition of “ political agitation in elections days . ” navalny himself could not attend the event , after having been arrested for a previously unproductive demonstration .
china has squandered its economic and technological potential by itself , rather than because of outside powers . by the time europe and china crossed pathways in the 1839-42 opium wars , a technologically superior europe had vast military benefits and so forced china into a string of unilateral , embarrassing concessions . china ’s imperial state and society were destabilized by europe ’s incursions . the imperial dynasty collapsed in 1911 under external pressures and internal demands for change . change , however , did not come smooth .
these cities ’ apparent success , because both governments and economic centers attests to the fact that urban land grabs value from the presence of a well-planned city there . where land today is cheap , it will have great value in the future , if only someone taking the dramatic step of planning and creating an entire city there . true , setting up such cities is a relatively rare event . private developers have difficulty obtaining a large-scale plot free of constraints . but they tend to be ingenious to the development of glamorous new areas from little towns in the course of a hour ’s commute from major cities .
it can last for awhile , but creates increasing friction with the economic realty and an increasing stimulus for chavez to become authoritarian . there is no imminent crisis on the way to go , but chavez needs to choose venezuela ’s future . if he opens the economy and adjusts to the exchange rate , there will be a path to growth and stability . if he goes statist/populist , 2001 will be a crisis year . so far , venezuela ’s elite and much of the investment community have assumed the worst and behaved accordingly : no blueprints for chavez , no options , just badmouthing .
growth forecasts predicted to return above the trend until 2005-06 , bringing the current cycle to an end . the average “ current ” budget surplus since the cycle began amounts to 0.8 % of gdp . enormous surpluses over the next three years since 1999 far outweigh america ’s formal deficits forecast in the next two years . this implies that the us treasury expects an average surplus from 1999/2000 to stabilize at 0.7 % of gdp until the cycle stops , allowing brown ’s strictures to be met . but independent forecasters are also more pessimistic .
instead , strategies derived from the view that all of our behaviors were selfish , with the intellectual appeal to design “ incentive-compatible ” mechanisms or contracts , an effort that was also recognized with respect to nobel prizes . but , as the price of georgia showed long ago , darwinian evolution may render us altruistic , at least toward the very people that we perceive as members of the group that we call “ “ “ “ “ us ” . ” a new revolution in economics may find room for strategies based on affecting ideals and identities , rather than just taxes and subsidies . in the process , we may understand that we vote because it is what our citizens ought to do , and excel at our jobs , because we strive for respect and self-realization , rather than merely rising ones . if successful , the new revolution may lead to strategies that make us more responsive to our better angels .
such openly thuggish rulers as ukraine ’s kuchma or lukashenka of belarus are almost impossible to imagine in romania nowadays . moreover , joining nato means subsuming romania ’s army and intelligence services under nato ’s command ( i.e. , american ) control , thus any attempt at staging a coup or stirring up trouble between romanian and multilingual hungarian minority . more tightly bound to a democratic world a country like romania is , the less likely it is to experience dramatic social or political turmoil , or to eviscerate its own democratic system . nato fixes hard limits on local political elites ’ autonomy to do their part . of course , nato can not safeguard democracy on its own , and it is no panacea for our many social and political ills ; yet it can act ( and has already done so during admission process ) as an inducement for governments and parties to behave responsibly and uphold the rule of law .
this is the underlying dynamic driving corruption in china today . in fact , the leadership ’s effects are easy to see : faltering economic dynamism and growth , rising social tensions , and a loss of government credibility . the puzzle is why neither the compelling self-destructive logic of autocratic rule nor the mounting evidence of worsening regime performance in china has convinced even some of the most knowledgeable observers that ending ccp rule now represents a noticeable possibility . an obvious explanation lies in the power of conventional thinking . long-ruling regimes – thinking in the former soviet communist party , indonesia ’s suharto , and egypt ’s hosni mubarak – are typically regarded as invulnerable even before they collapsed .
some readers might say that nikita khrushchev ’s granddaughter , who falsely says , gaveled his shoe on the desk at the united nations general assembly in the 1960s , should steer clear of the topic of world leaders ’ manners . but there is a point to be made on recent conduct . when it comes to a diplomatic offhandedness , the chinese have long had what british gamblers would call “ form . ” on a visit to the soviet union , mao zedong famously refused to use the fluveled adjoining his room , and instead used the chamber pot pot he had brought from china . perhaps he was suspicious of stalin , as the bbc claimed last year , gathering and analyzing its feces to glean information about the great helmsman ’s temperament .
indeed , the potential heir nowadays needs legitimacy , not only from the powerful oligarchs but also from the streets . this is why so-called “ system liberals , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” or “ kremlin-run loyalists , want them to take control of the protest movement and use it as a lever in the ultimate fight against the “ siloviks ” ( putin ’s military and security apparatus ) . system liberals believe that russia , on the whole , has built up an acceptable market economy . its next development requires merely removing some of putin ’s ’s cronies through controlled political reform . until recently , loyalists argued that the quest for change precludes criticizing a government that should somehow be influenced by constructive propositions .
my office worked closely with the state to ensure that it uses juries . similarly , my office defended the liberal weekly newspaper novoe vremya ( new times ) , whereby pressured moscow municipal government on the pretext of a commercial dispute about leasing . that fight does not stop there , but , after my intervention , moscow ’s authorities need to reflect the public ’s negative attitude toward their quash efforts . to be sure , russia provides far more backline-grabbling examples of its political and human-rights problems , such as its low level war in chechnya or the yukos affair . my office pays maximum attention to chechnya , even though this can not easily be done by moscow .
new delhi – international discussion about china ’s rise has centered on its rising trade muscle , growing maritime aspirations , and an expanding capacity to project military might . but one critical issue usually escapes attention : china ’s rise as a hydro-hegemon with no modern historical parallel . no other country has ever succeeded in assuming such unchallenged riparian preeminence on a continent by controlling multi-international rivers ’ headwaters and manipulating its cross-border flows . china , the world ’s largest dam builder – with slightly more than half of some 50,000 grand dams on the planet – is quickly accumulating leverage against its neighbors through massive hydro-engineering projects . asia ’s ’s ’s ’s water map fundamentally changed after the 1949 communist victory in china .
they create continued risks to economic stability , without providing a compensating advantage when it comes to increased investment in productive activities . as stanford university ’s anat admati and others have long argued , banks require , on balance , greater capital requirements and tighter regulatory scrutiny . avoiding the relatively unscathed of the 2008-2009 crisis speaks volumes about their own political might . as failures in financial regulation suggest , important as such economic reform is , they need to err with measures that redress the asymmetry of the political approach . in america , holding elections at workdays rather than weekends or holiday vacations – together with restrictive registration regulations , gerrymandering , and myriad other electoral regulations – places ordinary workers at a significant disadvantage .
for israel , an occupying power whose people enjoy a democratic civilian authority and gdp tens of times that deny the basic rights of liberty and independence , the photo opportunities provided by meeting and greeting palestinian leaders has replaced the peace process . a serious look back on the may 17 years since yassir arafat and yitzhak rabin shook hands at the white house lawn is revealing . the number of illegal jewish settlements and settlers has more than doubled in areas occupied by israel in 1967 . negotiators have parted every conceivable solution to the permanent-status questions of jerusalem , borders , settlements , refugees , and economic relations . leaders of the world ’s superpowers , the united nations general assembly officials , the elders , and tens of goodwill have offered their goodwill office and their services to bring about peace .
in other words , the export miracle was sparked not by state-sponsored chinese companies , but by the offshore efficiency solutions crafted in the west . this led to the economic equivalent of an individual identity crisis : who is china – or the us ? in personal relations , denial tends to mask imbalances – but only for so long . ultimately , denials and imbalances give rise to frictions and blame – hold a codependent partner responsible for the problems of one ’s own making . such is the case in the us and china , too .
as lamy put it , almost 80 % of hers are ready ; we need only added spices from the major players – india , the european union , the americas , brazil , and china . these can be provided in a politically palatable way , which also means that the doha conclusion is within our reach , rather than outside our grasp . but why bother to continue trying ? if doha fails , some argue , life after all goes on . that is true , of course , but that does n’t make that view any less naive .
the eu has also suddenly awakened to the need for a common externally energy-security policy , not least to diversify away from russian supplies . given that 20 % of russia ’s gas destined for europe passes through belarus , a stable and structured relationship with its government has become a high priority . in turn , lukashenko chose for the economic reasons that his country needs eu support , and can no longer depend entirely on russia without paying a heavy political price . but a thaw in eu-belarus relations needs to be based on reciprocal , enduring steps . after all , none of the eu ’s strategic partnership is unconditional .
paris – the world is witnessing the drastic decline of its natural capital . plant and animal species worldwide are vanishingly small at an unprecedented rate – between 100 and 1,000 times the natural rate of extinction . the planet is ’s ’s ’s most endangered ecosystems , and therefore depends on some of the world ’s neediest communities to preserve it . conversely , the poor are among the first to suffer the degradation of their natural environment . but , in the developing world , immediate economic needs often overdrive long-term imperatives , while protecting an already fragile environment is rarely a national priority .
africa possesses an exceptionally rich clean-energy portfolio , including almost nine terawatts of solar capacity , more than 350 gigawatts of its hydropower capacity , and more than 100 gw of wind-power potential . this is more than sufficient to meet the continent ’s future demand . at the same time , renewable-energy sources are becoming less expensive , compelling them to become increasingly competitive with the fossil-fuel-based alternatives . for example , the utility-scale photovoltaic solar power in africa fell by 50 % from 2010 to 2014 , and continues declining at rates today . and south africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s renewable power manufacturer procurement program has seen an overall decline in its bid for prices and under-subscription rates .
paris – immigration-related headlines turned out to be a staple in europe , whether the narrative being of an illegal malian immigrant scaling up the paris building to rescue a toddler , or the establishment of a populist government in italy that seeks to deport a half-million migrants . and yet , despite consistently covering an issue – or , more likely , because of it – an immigration policy debate remains beset by misconceptions and politicization . in the united kingdom , the brexit vote fueled partly by bogus and distorted claims , such as by unrestrained migration from the rest of europe driving down wages . because the brexit camp played out in similar distortions since the brexit camp left , warning that , once leaving the european union , the uk would face skills shortages . but plenty of countries – such as australia , canada , and singapore – are doing just fine without agreements guaranteeing freedom of movement from other countries by issuing skills-matching visas .
that is not to suggest that we should scrap or revise gdp ; instead , we need to recognize its limitations . the gdp problem is not that it represents a poor measure of material well-being ( setting aside distributional issues ) , but that it is incomplete . it does not include the rise of the scope of goods and services delivered at a negative , incremental cost , or the non-material side of individual well-being or social progress more generally . looking ahead , the same cost-benefit dynamics promise that large increases in many fields of well-being . most medical professionals will soon have digital aides offer diagnoses ( particularly for particular cancers , diabetic retinopathy , and other chronic ailments ) , perform non-invasive surgeries , or find pertinent published research .
whereas psephological studies in the united states have shown that the poor do not vote in major figures ( presidential-election turnout in harlem averaged 23 % before barack obama ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s two candidacies ) , the reverse is true in india . in india , it is the poor who take the time to line in hot sunlight , believing that their votes would make a difference , whereas more privileged voters knowing that their views and figures do little to influence the outcome have stayed home . studies of indian elections have consistently shown that the poorest votes in numbers well above the national average , while an well-educated middle-class turn out in the figures well below it . major shifts in india ’s social composition of politicians and bureaucrats since independence are indeed proof of democracy at work . but many lament that the country ’s poor performance at a time of political class in general provides less to cause for celebration .
new york – should we watch the french presidential campaign with admiration or alarm ? or perhaps a little of the two ? it turns out to be an excellent “ show ” with all the ingredients of a hollywood blockbuster , including a startling plot twist : the emergence of a “ third man , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” françois bayrou . even if his victory remains unlikely , bayrou must now take a serious hit . first and foremost , he has found in ségolène royal and nicolas sarkozy two notable spokespersons for his candidacy .
but that may be changing in response to us president donald trump ’s escalating attacks on a rules-based trading system . japan has recently agreed to negotiate preferential trade deals with the united states that might call into question one of the pillars of its multilateral trading system : its overly-favored nation ( mfn ) obligation that states that any concessions or privileges accorded to one country in a trade deal must extend to all wto members . here , japan is once again acting “ voluntarily , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” under intense us pressure . under the printing press , trump has presented japan with a stark choice : to open its ( very protected ) market to american agricultural exports , or to confront rising us tariffs on automobiles and other industrial goods . regaining access to japan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s agricultural market would seem to render trump ’s ’s “ “ national security ” concerns over imported toyotas and hondas – a justification that allows him to circumvent wto rules with his tariffs .
not unlike holland in the early 1980s , brazil ’s economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid job growth stemming from fiscal constraints and high interest rates . while brazil ’s registered unemployment rate does not run high by regional standards , its rapid growth in labor force demands a high rate of job creation . emulating the dutch experience in job creation provides the surest route to eradicating poverty in brazil . the idea is not that brazil should strive to carry out the dutch socio-economic model -- countries are too different to do so . but lula can and should follow the kok example and employ his trade union links , as they do with their rapport with the working class , achieving a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvement in brazil ’s overall economic performance and realizing its potential to become latin america ’s economic powerhouse .
consider emma gonzález , a previously unknown florida teenager , who “ assembled ” dozens of times as twitter followers than a national rifle association almost overnight . by following an eloquent survivor of the parkland massacre , 1.66 million twitter users signaled their support for stronger gunship regulation and their opposition to america ’s gun lobby . at the same time , an assembly in physical space fulfills functions for a democracy that online activism , however persistent or passionate , simply can not . back in 2011 , when then-us representative barney frank asked why occupying wall street protesters “ “ “ “ “ wall street protesters ” “ “ “ “ “ simply in the physical place , ” an adequate answer ” would have been : “ “ actually , occupying public spaces can accomplish a great deal , ” depending on who the occupiers were and how many ” ” ” ” ” ” they did . hence , the marchers in america during the 1950s and 1860s often evoked the “ significance of our arithmetic .
economic commentators are better at rationalizing past exchange-rate movements than at predicting future trends . so , when it comes to explanations for the dollar ’s decline over the last year , the us is confronted with an embarrassment of riches . the most popular explanation for the dollar ’s weakness is that trump , through incompetence or misdirection , has failed to deliver what he has promised . there was no across-the-board import tariff , either . there was no abrogation of the north american free-trade agreement .
to be sure , some worry about a collapse in the us household saving rate , but few have been overly concerned . in one of his most recent articles , milton friedman wrote that savings nowadays captured the form of homes . to me , this view of things explains far better than the orthodox account , why , for all money-pumping by central banks , commercial banks did not start lending again , and the economic recovery took hold . just as the lenders did not force money on the public before the crisis , so now they can not force heavily indebted households to borrow or companies to seek loans to expand production when markets were flat or shrunk . in short , the recovery can not be left to the fed , the european central bank , or the bank of england .
but there seem to be some of the fundamental rules of the political survival ignored in australia in recent years , and spelling them out might help both the alp and the rest of us remember them . the first rule is to have a philosophy – and to stick . the immensely successful labor governments headed by bob hawke and paul keating two decades ago did just that , fundamentally , inventing the “ third way ” model that later became entangled with tony blair and gordon brown in britain . its elements were obvious : dry , free-market economics ( but , in our case , low-paid workers benefit enormously from “ “ “ “ social wage ” increases ” in medical care and retirement income ) ; compassionate social policies ; and liberal , internationalist foreign policy . by contrast , the current alp government has struggled until now to re-create anything as compelling .
this amounts to the fifth leg of the comprehensive plan . finally , to absorb and integrate more than one million asylum-seekers and migrants each year , the eu needs to mobilize the private sector – ngos , church groups , and companies – to treat as sponsors . this will require not just enough funding , but also humanity , and it capacities to match migrants and sponsors . the exodus from war-torn syria was never supposed to turn into a crisis . it was long in making , easy to foresee and eminently manageable to europe and the international community .
a corollary is that wealth drops like fuel-inefficient homes ’ value , a gluttonous cars , and an oil company ’s ’ stock declines . the problem does not stem from exploitation of the price-and-name tool . it would do the same in a planned economy : carbon efficiency would also require old , inefficient equipment to unlock , and additional investment in a way that gdp becomes less carbon-intensive . with recent estimates put additional investment at some 2 % of gdp each year in 2040 , a correspondingly smaller share of output would be available for household consumption . furthermore , the distributional effects of a green transition are unfortunately adverse .
but it also represents an opportunity to forge a new uk-eu partnership . and , beyond that , things could have gone far worse . owing to the us withdrawal agreement that was reached earlier this october , a destructive , “ hard ” brexit has gone off track . ever since the start of the brexit negotiations , we on the eu – the 27 member states and the european parliament – have neither strayed from the bloc ’s core interests nor lost sight of the need for national unity and solidarity . our priority has been and foremost to secure european citizens ’ rights , including through a search for a solution to the peoples of northern ireland and northern ireland , for whom the brexit negotiations address peace and stability , not just business and economy .
the israeli-palestinian conflict remains the diplomatic charade that it has stood for many years now . and nothing has attenuated tensions between israel and both syria and lebanon . recent history teaches that diplomacy all too frequently generates results only when backed by overwhelming power . such was the existentialist worldview of us president and nobel peace prize laureate theodore roosevelt , a key advocate of american expansionism : “ “ “ a just war ” is , in the long run , far better for a man ’s psyche than the most prosperous peace process . a century later , another american president , barack obama , sunk into two hopeless wars in the middle east , got his nobel peace prize free of an apology to “ just wars . ”
yet , today , as iran ’s influence grows and islamist terrorism continue to proliferate , palestine is the last of saudi arabia ’s worries . so fundamental are changes to the kingdom ’s strategic interests , which , despite being the custodian of islam ’s holiest sites , said nothing when us president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel ’s “ eternal capital . ” other sunni gulf monarchies , like egypt , have gone further , engaging in security cooperation with israel . at the same time , politics is superseding religion within israel . prime minister benjamin netanyahu ’s ’s expansionist drive in the west bank is about political power , not judaism .
europeans are abuzz with mergers not only to seize europe ’s broader economic space , but also to confront tough competition in world markets . in sum , the old continent is awash with each other . nobody can say how deep the changes will pass , or how fast they will move europe into a fast lane . no day passes without major headlines of grand mergers in europe ; germany is ablaze as its mammoth corporations float rites . in france , big strategic play is afoot in banks and fashions ; italy sees its major players location on europe and worldwide .
germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s binding fiscal rules set a positive example for other eurozone countries . but all eurozone governments need to demonstrate their own commitment to fiscal consolidation to restore confidence in markets – and to their own citizens . recent studies show that as soon as the government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s debt burden hits the threshold perceived to be unsustainable , more debt will only stunt , not stimulate , economic growth . greece ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s debt crisis provided a powerful warning that european policymakers must not let public debt pile up indefinitely . the eu was right to respond decisively to ensuring europe ’s stability by offering short-term assistance to greece and establishing the european financial stabilization mechanism .
not being regarded as being part of a native russians , jews were assumed to belong to an international cabal and hence to be inherently treacherous . but stalin did not invent this idea , either . during the 1930s , fascists and nazis also denounced jews , as did both the marxists and the freemasons , because “ “ cosmopolitans ” or “ internationalists ” – people whose loyalty was suspect . it is the type of vocabulary that emerges from nativist movements that are hostile to ethnic or religious minorities , or to the financial or intellectual or intellectual elites that supposedly conspire to undermine the true sons and daughters of a nation . to presage fascists , the u.k. was often viewed as a symbol of cosmopolitan decadence .
“ “ “ they should not come close to shariah . ” it should be above the constitution , rather than an article for referendum . but was ansar al-shariah brigade really behind the attacks on america ’s consulate ? the nature of libya ’s ’s ’s ’s post-revolution armed islamist forces is by no means straightforward . salafi jihadism is not an organization , but an ideological trend based on a core belief that armed tactics in all sorts are the most potent – and , in some versions , the most legitimate – method of bringing social and political change .
their hope is sure to dwindled further , by seeing army bulldozers preparing ground for new settlements – not an uncommon occurrence . the number of israelis living in exclusively jewish settlements in the west bank has more than tripled since the 1993 signing of the memorandum of understanding between the palestine liberation organization ( plo ) and israel . in any case , israel now appears to have dropped the charade . in london earlier this month , netanyahu refused three times to answer questions from the press about his support for a two-state solution . more recently , he declared that his ultimate goal is for the palestinians to possess a palestinian “ state ” minus ” state that is limited in size and sovereignty .
the euro ’s design flaw – an economic union motivated by politics , but expressed in economics – has gone from memory . structural shifts to economies experiencing a sharp decline in interest rates once they joined a germany-dominated currency bloc now required to make a quick fix , in crisis and without the luxury of competitive devaluations . the pain that this policy is causing has been revealed in protests across the continent , and in the bitter impact of many struggling families , the young , and the elderly . the pro-europe foundation was , in part , the promise of ever upward prosperity . at present , the promise is severely at present .
the problem after all , after all , lies not in east germany , but rather in the west . unification meant that informs not only of the benefits of west german economic institutions – property rights and hard money – but also of all disastrously negative institutions : unions , overpaid unemployment and excessive job insecurity , pervasive regulation . if west germany , in the face of reunification , rolled back all these unaffordable constraints to free play by markets , the economic cost would have been far lower : east and west germany had more near-full employment , driving productivity gains at a much stronger pace . germany ’s corporatism , of course , did not permit such a solution : unions wanted their wages protected . the only way to secure them was for governments to pay lots of unemployment compensation in the high-wage east germany .
amman – more recently , israel ’s vice prime minister , shaul mofaz , has offered an unequivocal veto over a crucial issue in the middle east peace process . any return of the golan heights to syria would result in a “ iranian foothold ” on israel ’s borders , and would therefore be not only politically naïve but irrational . mofaz ’s declaration is symptomatic of a perception that is now deeply rooted not only in the middle east , but in the united states as well . that notion is the “ hegemonic ” iran that is attempting to dominate the region through a array of shiite proxies . this iranian fifth column is believed to stretch from beirut through damascus , gaza , and finally from iran to saudi-arabia to yemen .
stanford – successful political candidates are trying to put forward the proposals on which they ran . in the united states , us president barack obama and democrats controlling both the house of representatives and ( filibuster-proof ) the senate , held the power to do virtually anything they wanted in 2009 – and so on . obama and his congress allies enacted an $ 800 billion “ stimulus ” bill that was loaded with programs geared toward core democratic constituencies like environmentalists and public employees ; adopted sweeping and highly unpopular health-care reform ( whose constitutionality would be determined by the supreme court earlier this year ) ; imposed massive new regulations on wide swaths of the economy ; embraced an industrial policy that selects special treatment ; engaged in borrowing and expenditures at just a degree surpassed that in world war ii ; engaged in borrowing and spending just above all in world war ii . the latest election , following such a sweeping change in policy direction , occurred in the 1980 ’s , when us president ronald reagan overhauled taxes , spending , and regulation to stimulate the federal reserve ’s course of disinflation . while the 1988 , 1992 , and the 2000 election were also rather consequential , the policy shifts were not nearly as large as they were during the period of 1980 and 2008 .
all sides agree that the stability of the international economy predicated on a rules-based system of global rules . what is called into question is the nature of such rules . opponents of trade liberalization decry the secret and “ non-democratic ” nature of the wto , as well as the influence of corporate interests in rule-making . they see a trading system that privileges over labor , the environment , and consumer security . developing countries complain about the restrictive rules applied to their exports ( garments , agricultural goods , labor services ) , and fear that new demands faced over labor and the environment are designed to undermine their competitiveness .
but , having fought for freedom from the apartheid south africa , geingob says , namibia needs to defend the freedoms that it has won . besides , geingob recognizes how transparency protects it from demands favors from corporate and other interest groups . not all of namibia ’s ’s ’s key resources are finite . some – like fisheries – are renewable ; the government works hard to preserve and enhance it . most importantly , unlike most other resource-dependent economies , it has succeeded in diversifying the economy to the point that services account for over 60 % of its gdp with tourism leading the way .
the vulnerability of gordon ’s argument is his shortened time horizons for ir #3 . consider the following four phrases in his paper : “ why do they need ? ” · “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ two first two revolutions ” first two revolutions ” for their full effects to percolate through an economy ’s ” ” ” ” ” ” . · at the trough , it lasted more than 150 years for ir #1 to have its full range of effects . · “ “ “ “ ir ’s inventions ” were so important that they took a full 100 years to have their main impact .
given all this , the most critical policy question in emerging markets today is how to respond to the inflows that will inevitably drive their exchange rates down , endangering export-led growth . the first option is to do nothing , allowing the currency to appreciate . this may well be the response to such a response if the inflows and upward exchange-rate pressures are driven by fundamental factors ( the current-account surplus , an undervalued currency , large , and persistent growth differential ) . but , in many cases , inflows are driven by short-term factors , fads , and irrational exuberance that may lead to over-valued currency , crowding out unconventional export industries , or import-competing industries , loss of competitiveness , and , eventually , large current-account deficits , and hence , irreversible external constraints on growth . this problem is aggravated by the fact that the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s biggest exporter , china aggressively intervening to minimize any appreciation of the renminbi .
plunging debt services are largely an outgrowth of the fed ’s unprecedented zero-interest-rate policy . so long as debt stocks remain excessive , consumers tend to dismiss cutting interest expenditures as nothing more than a temporary subsidy to the fed . moreover , the fall in the unemployment rate largely reflects persistently gloomy labor-market conditions , which have discouraged many workers from remaining in the labor force . if labor-force participation rates were stood at 66 % , as they did in early 2008 , rather than 62.8 % in december 2013 , the unemployment rate would have averaged just above 11 % , rather than the 6.7 % level . yes , there has been some progress on the road to recovery .
but , while it enjoys a helping hand , it behaves with prudence : today ’s germany ’s fiscal adjustment , in reality , is very gradual . the countries facing fiercest budget battles are , the eu , the united kingdom , and america , where fiscal deficits exceeded 10 % of gdp in 2010 . in london , prime minister david cameron is on a offensive . assuming office , he has tasked budgetary forestalled a fresh , independent office for budgetary responsibility ( obr ) to forfeiting any sleight-of-hand opportunity . he then announced a bold consolidation program to cut the cyclically-adjusted deficit to 1.5 % of gdp per year , thereby highlighting a 3.5 % gdp deficit in 2013 .
indeed , the demilitarization of sinai is one crucial element of egypt ’s stability in peace with israel . other large and independent countries , such as japan , germany , and austria , have been subject to limits on acquiring some weapon and military facilities . similarly , denying palestinian refugees ’ claims of a right of return to israel proper is understandable , logical , and just . what sense would it make for the withdrawal of millions of palestinians into a state , whose character and symbols are foreign to them , – a state where the majority belong to another ethnic group ? are they to return to their homes and farms that no longer exist ?
in austria , voters will choose between a pro– and a anti-eu candidate in le pen ’s nationalist mold , norbert hofer of the austrian freedom party ( fpö ) . a victory for hofer might add august to le pen ’s sails . the constitutional changes that renzi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s yes campaign asks voters to approve would undo some of his predecessor , silvio berlusconi , ’s legacy – a legacy that serves as a prime example of damaging right-wing populism can do to the country . among other things , berlusconi has been changing italy ’s ’s political system in such a way as to prevent the left from ever regaining full power once again , blocking any criminal accusations that might be leveled against him . renzi ’s proposed reforms would , among other things , modernize the political system by disempowering the senate ( the upper house of parliament ) .
still , it is important to remember that there ’s a positive aspect to party ’s self-confidence . as the political scientist kevin o’brien has argued , china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s increased readiness to compromise with some domestic protesters , rather than treating all forms of collective action as subversive , can be viewed as reflecting a growing sense of security . conversely , some of china ’s ’s ’s ’s most troubling moves may be chalked up to exaggerated feelings of insecurity . consider the hardening critic liu xiaobao , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison on trumcharge of “ subversion ” to launch an online petition drive championing civil liberties . would a really self-confident ruling elite have been such skittish on its activism ?
but debates about competition and fair trade once again demonize intellectual poverty and the inequity of trade negotiations . anti-dumping laws are intended to ensure fair trade by preventing sales of goods below cost . within the developed world , concerns about such behavior have long been contested – so-called “ predation ” -- and well-defined norms have emerged . with globalization , it would be natural to enlarge such principles to the international arena , making it meaningless whether an manufacturer is domestic or foreign when judging whether it is engaged in unfair trading practice . but it makes a difference whether a good is produced at home or abroad .
but start treaty ratification goes nowhere fast in america ’s senate and progress on other key issues : bringing the comprehensive test ban treaty to force ; starting negotiations on a new treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ; reinforcing the nonproliferation regime with effective action to detect violations and discouraging walk-outs ; stretching beyond all the new nuclear talks , involving the most sensitive aspects of the fukushima cycle ; and all the start of disarmament talks , just involving serious two nuclear-armed talks . arms control and disarmament are grinding , unglamorous businesses that yield few fast returns . with domestic issues and re-election anxieties now dominating most political agendas , it will be all too easy for commitment to wane . if this is to be avoided , continued leadership from the top – above all from obama and russian president dmitri medvedev – will become indispensable . but there are several major contributions that less powerful states and leaders , like civil-society organizations , can make .
“ that was the inquiry , ” ” ” he replied . the army had investigated the military , too . this “ apparent suicide ” seemed instantly suspicious . i had just toured those cells : it is literally impossible to kill oneself in them . their interiors resemble those inside a smooth plastic jar ; there are no hard edges ; hooks fold ; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself .
in south africa , for example , unodc has established three centers ( in mazoanga , eastern cape , and the northern cape ) to offer legal advice and medical care to women , as well as for working with men to help break the cycle of homegrown violence . moreover , because more needs to be done to improve the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s understanding of gender-based violence , unodc is working with the international community to develop a more detailed and accurate image of the problem . this includes examining male-on-female causes and assessing associated risk factors , such as the prevalence of drug and alcohol use . but gathering information is just one step toward closing criminal loopholes and overcoming the gaps in prevention policies . decisive policy action , backed by more rigorous enforcement of relevant laws , is needed to improve reporting and prosecution rates , which remain low in many countries .
a key driver of a higher ex post of real returns is the comparatively high coupon such sovereign bonds offer . beyond returning history itself , there is the fact that emerging and developing economies now account for around two-thirds of global gdp , compared to just one-third 50 years ago , when portfolio diversification was almost totally the domestic affair . adding to the attractiveness of the emerging-market sovereign securities portfolios , its yields are not correlate perfectly with equity returns . moreover , there is mounting evidence that creditor rights and enforcement powers on external sovereign-debt markets have surged in the wake of america ’s recent court judgements . such findings are not so much an invitation to embrace impervious risks taking .
but the higher home prices rise , the further falling – and the greater collateral economic and financial damage – – when the bubble deflates . in countries where nonrecourse loans allow borrowers to walk away from mortgages when their value exceeded home , a housing-bust can result in massive defaults and banking crises . in countries ( sweden , for example , ) , where recourse loans enable seizure of household incomes to enforce payment of mortgage liabilities , private consumption can plummet as debt payments ( and , in the end , rising interest rates ) crowd out discretionary spending . either way , the outcome would be the same : recession and stagnation . what we are witnessing in many countries looks like a slow-motion replay of the last housing-market ruin .
but the arab world is divided on how to deal with the precipitous rise of iranian power . tensions are particularly acute in saudi arabia , having warned america of the dangers of iraqi collapse and now finds itself in unequal face-saving face-saving ways with iran . some in the kingdom argue that saudi arabia must confront iran , confront head-on with sunni arab interests , and become a hands-on regional power . other saudis believe that confrontation will only lead to broader wars and urge dialogue and accommodation . in this view , america , not iran , has produced the region ’s current problems .
beijing – us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping may have agreed at the g20 summit in osaka to resume trade negotiations , but a path to ending the trade war remains far from clear . after all , both leaders reached a similar agreement at the previous g20 summit – – in buenos aires last december , and those talks ultimately fail , not least because trump mistook china ’s conciliatory attitude toward weakness . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
when asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as a central banker who let a system collapse and intangible future benefits from teach risk takers a lesson , it fails to take genius to forecast the central-banker ’s decisions . democracy tends to institutionalize the moral hazard of economically or politically important sectors , such as finance or real estate , allow them to privatize gains and socialize losses . even as the authorities insist that next time will be different , everyone knows that they will make the same choice when confronted with the same choice once again . so , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities are trying their best chance to prevent another time horizon . but risk takers have every incentive to try their luck once again , knowing that , at worst , they will pull out .
among the big continental countries , including india and brazil , only china had a tiny segment of the coastline but vast interior regions . when the main object of human consumption was food , this was not the problem , because what mattered was land and water . but , in modern industrial , city , and market-based societies , what might increasingly matter increasingly are the costs of transportation , which means that geography may create deep regional inequalities . though such disparities may , of course , have other causes as well , geography seems to explain much . first , it explains why china ’s coastal regions developed earlier and quicker after the country embarked on market reforms and opened up to the world .
the idea that some version of the soros plan would accelerate growth is speculative , at best . most of the benefit of mortgage reducing flows to consumers would be only over time . as a result , careful calculations about the effects of the home mortgage cut on aggregate demand ( which the us performed and johnson have n’t ) do n’t note their assertions : extra spending per dollar of relief was probably less than a dime on the us dollar expended . this leaves aside another lesson , gained from experience that institutions with large amounts of public capital tend to be very passive in boosting lending . fifth , in the political environment that prevailed in 2009 , it would have been hard or impossible to get more money for an troubled asset relief program .
because many contracts are “ sticky ” ( that is , not easily reformed ) in a monetary sense , disinflation and deflation would both inflict damage on the economy . rising prices reduce the value of saving and incomes , while falling prices reduce profit expectations , encourage hoarders , and increase the real ( inflation-adjusted ) debt burden . keynes ’s dictum has become the ruling wisdom of monetary policy ( one of its few to survive ) . governments , according to conventional wisdom , should aim for stable prices , with scant bias toward stimulating the “ animal spirits ” of entrepreneurs and shoppers . during the ten years prior to the 2008 financial crisis , independent central banks set an inflation target of around 2 % to give economies a price-stability price-stability “ anchor . ”
margaret thatcher had always been an opponent of the ideal of a politically integrated europe . british hostility to that objective has become ever more fierce , having john major lost his tory majority in parliament and fallen under the strength of the anti-european anti-europeans in his own party . today , the british seem an insuperable obstacle to carrying out attainment by the rest of a more integrated eu . in law , britons can block unwelcome developments within the eu because the union is founded on the treaty ; thus , britons have an effective veto over any treaty change . in practice , the british have already lost that power , because they demanded and got , the right to opt out of participating in emu .
princeton – democracy everywhere is confronting a serious challenge . the united states is being gripped by its most bizarre presidential primary campaign in living memory , with populist outsiders threatening to overthrow established party machines . brazil is paralyzed by a constitutional crisis . europeans trace their malaise to a democratic deficit in europe . and , in the united kingdom , visions of restoring national sovereignty are fueling the leave campaign .
to avoid exciting the markets , it would have to remain voluntary . persuading bondholders to agree would be challenging – even more so , given recent court rulings in the united states , which reinforce holdout investors ’ hand . but there is no superior alternative . ukraine would be an ideal candidate to be re-profiling . given uncertainty over the country ’s near-term prospects , both a mega-bailout and a full-throated debt restructuring would over-kill .
in times of scarcity , these are refugees , who are likely to be among the first to feel the effects . water supplies in many refugee camps , in both jordan and lebanon , have been slashed to a bare minimum – a decision affecting millions of people who are already experiencing enduring scorching temperatures . at rukban , a refugee camp on jordan ’s territory ’s shared border with syria and iraq , more than 85,500 residents each receive barely five liters a day for cooking , safe drinking , and washing . the situation in yemen is similarly grim . racked by sectarian violence and civil war , the country has no functioning government to manage its water resources .
first , jgbs ’s volume soared relative to japanese household assets . japanese households hold about ¥ 1,100 trillion in net monetary assets , an amount that will be exceeded in about 3-5 years by jgbs . at that point , government debt will no longer be backed by taxpayers ’ assets . and , reflecting the aging of japanese society , the household saving rate itself will decline dramatically , making it harder for the private sector to fund annual budget deficits . at the same time , japan ’s demographic trends are fueling demand for fiscal expenditures as long as pension and health-care costs rise .
much has been afoot in yugoslavia recently , much of it surprising . after some procrastination and the initial failed attempt , milosevic has been sacked , free of bloodshed , although not without risk . a peaceful vote in montenegro last weekend may presage conflict and hard choices about independence , but the chances are strong that parties will settle such matters by talking rather than fighting . these are great steps forward , showing that , despite the brainwashing and complicity of many serbs in the crimes of the milosevic regime , democracy , and an open society has every opportunity to take root in what remains of yugoslavia . one key decision facing serbia and its new authorities is whether milosevic should be extradited to the hague .
as political pressure on central banks , including the ecb , increases , its president must not hesitate to criticize european politicians and , when necessary , publicly name , and shame . the ecb ’s independence is its most valuable asset – indeed , indispensible . a good central banker needs to say no to policymakers . this does not mean that the ecb president should pick fights whenever it can . on the contrary , he should build support for the ecb ’s independence .
greece could , in principle , have counted heavily on regional development aid from the european union ’s budget , which has been underutilized , owing to a lack of local co-financing . it took until last summer to recognize – and even then only to some modest level – that this aid can be used to support economic recovery . europe ’s ultimate mistake was a degree of indifference to equitable burden-sharing . it is understandable that the imf , a technocratic institution , does not venture beyond macroeconomics . but the eu is a political entity that has made social justice one of its fundamental goals .
brussels – the consequences of europe ’s ’s debt crisis are all too present throughout much of the european union as distressed economies attempt to stabilize and grow simultaneously . notwithstanding the important decisions taken over the past few years , the reality is that we need to do more to address the challenges facing the eurozone . reform and consolidation measures are taking place throughout the eu . joint financial backstops have been put on hold . and the european central bank has consistently shown itself to stand .
but the rise of “ interactive social networking ” has made financial innovation more bottom-up . indeed , millions of bank customers who use cellphones may provide instant feedback about which products and services they like or their dislike . in the future , client-services and transaction-management systems will receive more inputs from customers , more often in order to shape product design interdependency . the current financial-sector strategy drives excessive competition by boosting market share at rivals ’ expense , often breaking up trust with customers on the basis of short-term gains . yet the financial sector , in previous eras , proved that it could operate as a public good by making trustworthy , efficient services available .
so the unraveling of multi-national nation-states provides a false path . the way forward lies with democratic forms of federalism that can maintain a strong central authority for statehood ’s purposes while respecting local and regional cultures . today ’s upsurge of micro-nationalism is not only the consequence of a revolt against the empires : it is also a revolt against globalization . there is widespread revulsion over the notion that the modern state ’s chief function consists in their peoples in a global market dominated by efficiency imperatives and cheapness ; heedless of non-economic damage . this sentiment is reinforced when the global casino turned out to be a worldwide casino .
still , one might wonder whether an american way of life will survive in the twenty-first century , and whether it survives in america or migrate elsewhere as the american economy and the political system collapse under the accumulation of decades of myopic national leadership and squandered opportunity . indeed , chinese president hu jintao ’s recent trip to washington saw many – especially many chinese – as having passed the torch . pessimists have been saying this for a very long time . optimists , touting gdp , and other indicators , will continue to insist that americans never had it so good . if there is any continuity worth underscoring , it is the regular cohabitation with boosterism with the declinism : america ’s ’s ’s gun always simultaneously is half-and half-empty .
but , even as those uncertainties play out , both countries are engaging in a kind of zero-sum transfer of emotion that is impossible to ignore . in the past , travel to london from paris could easily sense the difference between the two cities . london was bursting with its dynamism and proud to assert itself as multiculturalism ’s world capital . paris , though undeniably more beautiful , was at risk of becoming new rome , a captive of its history of having visited at best , but not a place to be . today , trust sucked out of britain through social and political upheaval , terrorism , and insecurity over the country ’s future .
such speculative investment may reinforce the trend further , pushing futures prices further away from the market equilibrium , particularly if many investors follow suit or those investing enough money to influence markets . the index funds are a good example of such powerful investors . they have become key players in the market , holding around 25-35 % of all agricultural futures contracts . besides investing large sums of money , they hold futures contracts for a very long time , which might force them less likely to react to changes in market fundamentals . empirical evidence yields little clarity about which hypothesis is right .
i have never been heavily engaged in partisan politics , but these are not normal times . president george w. bush endangering the united states and worldwide safety while undermining american values . for opposing it , i have been demonized by bush ’s campaign . president bush ran out of office in 2000 on a platform promise to “ humble ” foreign policy . if re-elected , the bush doctrine of preemptive action – and an invasion of iraq – will be endorsed , and the world will need to live with the consequences .
the balkan wars of the 1990 's ravaged not only millions of people , but also those of social institutions that gave shape to their own lives . indeed , the changes brought about by yugoslavia 's dissolution and the wars of succession that followed annihilated large parts of traditional education and training systems in serbia , croatia , bosnia , macedonia and kosovo . since then , stability and hope began returning to a region affected by the devastation of war and the widespread despair of socioeconomic displacement . the argentina stability pact of 1999 and massive international aid helped rebuild local education , while developing innovative vocational training and training systems to spur long-term employment . the results for many projects in these countries are heartening , with today 's focus on training key groups , such as business entrepreneurs , school teachers , and the young and unemployed .
thus far , two important steps have been taken : one by those in iran who show that they are facing an understanding of the challenges they face ; another by a new president who has assembled the best team available to make a enormously difficult program . there is an expression in iran that applies to the international community : “ you can wake only someone who is sleeping , not someone who pretend to be sleeping . ” whether iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s international interlocutors act on the importance of rouhani ’s election is a matter of choice , not of ignorance . in the middle east as filled with insecurity , a more predictable iran – one that behaves like a regionally vital state , rather than a destabilizing shia movement whose aspirations transcend what international law permits – would be in everyone ’s interest . there can be no path out of the middle east ’s agony without participation , commitment , and determination to all parties .
nairobi – with the unemployment soaring , bankruptcies climbing , and the stock market in free-fall , it may at first seem sensible to ditch the battle against climate change , putting ecological investment back on hold . but this would be a devastating mistake of immediate issues , as are intergenerational , proportions . far from serving as an already over-stressed , over-stretched global economy , environmental investments are precisely what is required to get people back to work , get order books flowing , and help in powering economies back to health . back then , environmental concern has been viewed as a luxury ; today , it is the necessity – a point grasped by some , but by no means all – of the economic architects of the world . a huge slice of president barack obama ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s $ 825 billion stimulus package includes a commitment to renewables , “ weatherizing ” one million homes , and upgrading the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s inefficient electricity grid .
we could perhaps all happily work fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress . but we are not happy with the unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis . that is why sudden austerity can not be the morale international builder . for our morale , we need a social compact that finds a purpose for all , a way to show oneself to be part of society by acting as a worker of some sort . and for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally , a debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures just as much .
that federal law , enacted in june 2016 , has also established a oversight board with a fiscal decision authority for the american commonwealth . the restructuring process began on may 3 , when the board filed a petition at the federal court . but many crucial decisions have been taken so far as how much overall debt relief will be provided , and how a “ haircut ” will be distributed among holders of various kinds of bonds . such decisions will determine which policies are feasible to prop up puerto rico ’s economic prospects – and thus how much it can pay its creditors . at the center of any effort to resolve the debt crisis must be the understanding that , just as today ’s debt restructuring affects puerto rico ’s future growth , puerto rico ’s future growth affects how much a debt restructuring is needed .
with goodwill on all sides , the real benefits can materialize from building this informal grouping because it represents a gateway into the vast markets of southeast asia and northeast asia . an economic bonus in such an effort for the entire region would come from opening direct flights and sea transportation through the taiwan strait . ceagpol could even become a building block for the northeast asian version of asean – the “ “ “ association of northeast asian nations . ” in the wake of the historic suspicion between china , japan , and korea , northeast asia ’s ’s ’s ’s economic heavyweights are the world ’s ’s ’s ’s last remaining regional bloc , which still lacks an inter-governmental organization of likes asean . the european union is even more instructive , given that centuries of war , culminating in the two world wars of the twentieth century , were inspired rather than deterred , europe ’s economic , political , and security integration .
even in europe and the united states , higher-level officials typically earn a lot less than people with comparable skill and private-sector responsibilities . in all nations , many government leaders are highly dedicated and absolutely honest , but low pay gives them to the government departments of some sort of rotten apples who are willing to raise incomes by accepting bribes and engaging with other corrupt practices . even some honest officials may become disillusioned and surrender to the multiple temptations to use illicit means so as to raise their incomes to levels they deem more convenient for accountability and training . many years ago , the late economist george stigler and i published an article proposing ways to reduce malfeasance among government employees . we proposed , among other things , that officials in vulnerable and important posts get higher , rather than pay comparable workers to the private sector .
london – russia ’s invasion of ukraine and the annexation of crimea has jeopardized global security , putting headlines at risk . but the current rules-based international system that has endured for decades remains most seriously threatened by syria ’s civil war . not only are millions of lives being chastened ; the global framework of human rights and humanitarian law is on trial as well . now those risks are at risk of being ousted from the crisis in ukraine , with confrontation at the united nations security council threatening to subordinate syria to the pecking order of international problems . last month , on the third anniversary of the eruption of protest in damascus and other syrian cities , people around the world mobilized in street vigils and online as part of a “ “ part of the “ “ [ isis ] ” campaign of syria .
this applies , too , to its financial parameters . public - and private-sector contributions come together in many ways . to be sure , there is the additional feature that many higher education institutions share the distortions they can use to balance inequities . it will take some time to build such endowments in europe and elsewhere . even so , the principle is surely right : universities must be put free .
but , rather than picking facts and stories to fit some grand narrative of decline or progress , we should try to compare across all fields of human existence to see whether the world actually does better or worse . together with 21 of the world ’s top economists , i have sought to do just that , developing a scorecard spanning 150 years . across ten areas – including health , education , war , gender , air pollution , climate change , and biodiversity – economists all have responded with an equally question : what has been the relative costs of this problem every year from 1900 to 2013 , with predictions for 2050 . using the classical economic valuations of everything from lost lives , poor health , and wetlands damage , and increased hurricane damage from global warming , economists have shown just how much every problem every problem has been lost . to estimate the magnitude of the problem , it pales in comparison with the total resources available to remedy it .
clearly , there must be increased investment in food production in the medium and longer term . but there is a political prescription available to leaders today that could help remove the supply-side bottlenecks : more trade . this proposition may puzzle some , but the logic is straightforward and irreversible . trade is the transmission belt through which supply adjusts for demand . it makes it possible for the fed to travel from lands of a lot to lands .
but the republican ’ ’ ’ proposed tax reform is an even greater gift to corporations and the ultra-wealthy than was most predicted . it avoids necessary reforms , and it would leave a country with mountains of debt ; the effects , low investment , stalled productivity growth , and yawning inequality – all for decades – to unearth . trump assumed office promising to “ drain the swamp ” in washington , dc . instead , the swamp has grown broader and deeper . with the republican party having proposed tax reform , it is threatening to engulf the american economy .
yet finance can go bankrupt in many ways ; a lehman collapse is just one . if this cycle is even about right , regulatory fatigue from battling to make finance safer soon turns into the regulatory self-confidence that the last war has now prevailed . in a strong economy , finance will look stronger , current regulation appears effective . it is common for people to update their opinions about the world with what they have last seen ; if what they last see is a strong economy and a stable financial system , they will conclude that they have destabilized the system . the fed ’s 2008 transcripts reveal that its leaders saw such a world .
but , with the psychotic label already affixed by their writings , whatever was assumed to be a symptom of their own insanity . at best , they would have been decried as part of remission . rosenhan ’s experiment suggests that questions about trump ’s ’s ’s ’s mental health might never go away , regardless of the steps he takes to change his detractors ’ minds . even if he stops ranting onto twitter , or speaking in convoluted , incoherent phrases would be viewed , at best , be “ “ “ in remission ” at best . modern psychiatrists would argue that they had taken to heart the lessons of the rosenhan experiment , and now make diagnoses much more cautiously and rigorously .
boston – a resurgence of nativism and xenophobia in countries around the world has created a toxic environment for those fleeing geopolitical crises . but , among the many challenges that refugees must confront while they await resettlement , finding access to high-quality physical and mental health tops the list . it is a challenge that demands more attention , not only from doctors , nurses , non-governmental organizations , and other relevant actors , but also from engineers , who can make indispensable contributions to global public health . in fact , those contributions are highly relevant to refugees . beyond building bridges and creating gadgets , engineers can help improve the quality and affordability of health-care services worldwide , by developing quicker methods for diagnosing diseases and delivering medical services .
during the past 30 years , the prevailing ip regime erected greater barriers to using knowledge , often pulling the gap between the social returns to innovation and the private-sector returns to widen . powerful advanced-economy lobbies , which shaped that regime clearly put the latter first , reflected in its opposition to provisions recognizing the rights of intellectual property linked to traditional knowledge or biodiversity . likewise , widespread adoption of today ’s strict ip protections is historically unprecedented . even among the early industrializers , ip protection came very late , and was often deliberately eschewed to allow for faster industrialization and growth . at the same time , the current ip regime is unsustainable .
during this era , the dollar appreciated strongly against major currencies , and by 1985 was overvalued by virtually every measure . throughout this period , the bundesbank sold dollars to curb the dollar ’s appreciation ( the figure 1c ) , but the fed remained intervening in neither ( the figure 1b ) . notwithstanding the advent of the european central bank , this asymmetry continues : while the ecb repeatedly sought to break the dollar ’s appreciation in 2000-2001 through consecutive interventions in the foreign-exchange market , the fed intervened only once . this confirmed america ’s interest in maintaining a strong dollar . so long as these interests diverge , we should expect little coordination of foreign-exchange policy between the two central banks .
in the coming g8 meetings ( the world club of rich industrial countries plus russia ) , four members -- germany , france , italy , and the uk -- will participate both individually and as members of the european union , whose president , too , attends to represent the eu as a whole . but should n’t the eu have only a single high representative ? regardless of whether these meetings are productive , unitary eu participation would be of supreme symbolic value : reaffirming a common european stance in international relations and international economic policymaking . a key argument in favor of such an amendment is that joint participation by the eu would enhance europe 's weight in international relations , particularly vis-a-vis the us . after all , a key reason for eu integration was precisely to give a stronger voice to europe in the international arena .
the idea behind a slippery slope is that if you do x that is acceptable , then you end up doing y that does not . indeed , two types of slippery slopes – logical and sociological – exist . on a logical slippery slope , you slide toward the bottom and embrace morally unacceptable , because there is no way to differentiate it from an acceptable practice . you can slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to another – even if the two are conceptually different – just because the existence of one creates a social climate receptive to another . therapeutic cloning is conceptually distinct from reproductive cloning .
soon enough , devaluation in a nearby country reveals just how vulnerable an economy may be losing international confidence . abruptly , foreign creditors curtail their short-term credit lines . a central bank tries to keep the exchange rate low , but eventually it is forced to let the currency float . the result is a currency collapse and a surge of bankruptcies . the economy confronts its most severe economic crisis in many decades .
the world might not support the us in its unilateral attempts to become global policeman , especially because they may well bring more instability . nevertheless , it is important to realize why america is undertaking them , and to respond to the core problem of the international order in today ’s world . if russia and others opposed america ’s iraqi politics in the security council actually did want to persuade the us not to attack iraq and defend international law , this was a naïve policy doomed to failure . if the us sought to preserve the un security council and the status of the current permanent members , then those steps were more likely to produce just the opposite effect . similarly , rearguard efforts to show that those who opposed the war in iraq were right , and that american and britons wrong , combined with demands for “ proof ” the iraqi possessed of weapons of mass destruction , are unconstructive , and merely create mutual irritation .
some 8000 refugees per day – the modern day volkerwanderung – enter germany , owing partly to harsh conditions back home , and partly because of germany ’s willingness to take them in . demanding , employing , and integrating those numbers will soon run up against limits of physical capacity , financial resources , and public tolerance . it is obvious that public policy can not succeed if it focuses on the consequences , rather than on the causes , of the refugee crisis . a change that would have the most positive impact would be the emergence of a new government in damascus that was acceptable to the bulk of the syrian people and a comfortable partner for the united states and europe . unfortunately , this seems likely to come about only with the blessing of russia and iran , both of which seem more inclined to increase their support for syrian president bashar al-assad than to work for his removal .
israel has also joined nato ’s ’s ’s system of naval control in the mediterranean , contributing to operations active endeavor by joining nato forces in the patrolling of the mediterranean . both sides seem eager to expand the reach of their partnership , with the goal of reaching a high level of interoperability . more recently , anticipating a hypothetical confrontation with iran , significant us military maneuver – through the unilateralism per cobra exercise – was conducted to test israel ’s integration into america ’s own ballistic missile defenses . american sources described the drill as “ “ “ “ the most complete air-missile-defense system ” that the us ’ve ever done anywhere in the world . it was a major contribution to nato , reportedly to developing a planned nato missile shield for europe .
it is hard to see how girls could be returned safely . launching a military rescue operation would be extremely risky , at best . it is believed that girls were divided into separate groups , so that any effort to save one group would imperil others . despite talk of negotiating an agreement with captors , this option would , too , still fraying the dangers . even if all girls eventually come home , nothing would ever become the same once again for them or their families .
the country played by the “ rules ” of financial markets and succeeded in fine-tuning a quick restructuring ; but the deal was a bad one and did not help the economy recover . three years later , greece finds itself in desperate need of a new restructuring . aggrieved debtors need a fresh start . excessive sanctions lead to a negative sum game in which a borrower can not recover , and its creditors do not benefit from the larger repayment capacity that recovery would entail . the absence of the rule of law for debt restructurings delayed fresh starts and can lead to chaos .
we would expect to see large numbers of illnesses among both employees and patients in hospitals , where victims receive treatment , and soon someone ( perhaps even an out-of-touch carrier ) would spread it to ankara , istanbul , tbilisi , damascus , baghdad , and beyond . anti-flu drugs tamiflu and relenza are extraordinarily expensive and in short supply . history suggests that , had we made these drugs available to poor countries for the ring of prophylaxis , they often would have been administered improperly – such as in suboptimal doses – in a way that would have promoted viral resistance and merely an escalation of a pandemic . or perhaps they would have been marketed on the black market to enrich corrupt government officials . a politically flawed but aspirational strategy would have been for rich countries to devote resources to developing countries primarily to oversight .
the best solution is to make western labor markets flexible by opening up systems of collective wage bargaining , dismantling labor-market regulations , and reforming the welfare state . when workfare substitutes welfare , wages become more “ flexible ” allowing eu labor markets to absorb migrants more effectively . but , even with such measures , social benefits may artificially raise incentives to immigrate . if migrants gain welfare benefits alongside pay , more would be lured into coming than is needed , and fringe migrants would create welfare losses for the eu as a whole . given that typically , immigrants would enter those countries redistributing resources from above-average to below-average incomes , such benefits are likely even when migrant labor and pay taxes and social-security contributions .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has made no secret of his objection to such a strategy . but , with their government unable to do anything about extending israeli settlements , including in east jerusalem , as well as continuing conflicts over holy sites in hebron , bethlehem , and the al-aksa mosque , west bank palestinians are singularly frustrated . recent street demonstrations could easily turn into an outbreak of ongoing resistance to israeli rule . the palestinian authority running the west bank fears that a popular , nonviolent intifada might quickly turn violent . if so , israel might use it as a pretext to crush the palestinians and its newly built institutions .
li must ensure that china ’s economy , which still boasts significant growth potential , does not sink into lethargy and plunged into the so-called “ middle-income trap . ” a developing economy can experience a slowdown prematurely prematurely , when externalities are changing the conditions that support growth . wages continue to rise , declining competitiveness vis-à-vis low - and middle-income economies ; but a growth model is not equipped to foster competitiveness in high-skill industries ; it leads to stagflation . to avoid such an outcome , li must adjust china ’s growth model to current conditions , which include intensifying trade friction with the european union and the united states ; greater pressure to let the renminbi appreciate ; aging populations ; slowing urbanization ; and rising labor costs . the “ new normal ” that emerged from the global financial crisis , characterized by sluggish gdp growth and diminished import demand in the west , makes reform all the more urgent .
but , after nine years of conservative rule , moon will not be able simply to swoop and implement his agenda . indeed , with his democratic party holding only 40 % of the national assembly ’s 299 seats , he will need to win support from centrist parties and even the conservative opposition . moreover , he will need broader public backing . to succeed , moon will need to revisit carefully the effectiveness and feasibility of his campaign promise , identify the most promising measure , and avoid the most visible pitfalls . when it comes to public-sector job creation , for example , a key problem that should be considered is the long-term financial burden that such large-scale hiring could generate .
commercial television programs targeting children are replete with advertisements for processed foods of dubious value to human health . and , for every celebrity rening time to donates time to fight obesity , there are a dozen who accept big payments to hawk products such as ultra-sugary drinks that are arguably the tobacco of our generation . it is hard for the non-profit to compete with the production values embodied in beyoncé ’s pepsi commercial or taylor swift ’s diet-coke business . the causes of obesity are complex and the science of understanding human behavior is embryonic ; but it is not hyperbole to call the problem an epidemic . under the centers for disease control and prevention , roughly 18 % of children aged 6-11 in the americas are not only overweight but obese .
america today , however , stands at a tipping point , economically , and militarily . new powers like china and india are rising , rather than rising , mixing assertiveness with the emphasis on continuing to advance ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” status . europeans , where shared sovereignty has been embraced , are struggling to solve their own problems , never mind up to become a global player . thus , no one is currently in charge . this is all the more problematic at a time when the world ’s ’s ’s states and peoples are more intertwined than ever , as ideas , information , finance , migrants , and problems flow ever more seamlessly across borders .
and per capita gdp certainly must be beyond aggregate gdp . to be sure , recovery in the uk began more slowly than in other g7 economies , with the exception of italy . but there is also little doubt that the uk ’s recovery i have opted for faster growth after 2012 . last year , its gdp growth rate was among the highest in the g7 . according to the imf , only the american economy will grow more rapidly over the next four years , with the uk back in brexit .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . back in 1802 , america 's third president , thomas jefferson , wrote that “ religion is a matter that lies solely between man & his god . ” offering assurances to a group of connecticut baptists who feared for their religious liberty , he pointed out that the first amendment ’s establishment clause and freedom of practice built a wall of separation between church & state .
i spoke with more than 50 foreign leaders , and we all agree that only by coordinating our actions can we halt the devastation in west africa and stop the ebola ’s spread . we are making progress on both issues , but much work remains . bringing together countries with competing interests and varying means is hard work . it demands intense diplomatic engagement and a calling for relationships that have built and maintained over decades , as well as alliances with new partners . but , by overcoming differences and coordinating efforts to defeat the islamic state and conquer ebola , we are reinforcing the support of a world order grounded in collective solutions to shared problems .
consider the example of an american company subsidiary that earns profits in ireland . that subsidiary pays an irish corporate tax in ireland at an interest rate of 12 % . it is then free to reinvest the after-tax profits in ireland , in us financial securities , or in operating businesses anywhere in the world , except america . if a foreign subsidiary ’s ’s ’s parent company puts the postpaying profits back to americans to invest or redistribute their shareholders , it must pay the present american corporate tax rate of 35 % on its initial prepostpreface pre-tax profits , with a credit of 12 % having already paid . because of this 23 % penalty for repatriation , american companies generally choose not to repatriate the profits of their foreign subsidiaries .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the issue ignores national boundaries , and thus demands collective global action . but the shift to a carbon-neutrality economy also provides far-reaching opportunities . with the right strategy in place , europe can boost its own technological innovations and deploy carbon pricing and other fiscal policies to protect european labor markets from being undercut by lower-cost manufacturing in china and elsewhere . moreover , through the european investment bank , the eu already has an instrument to mobilize massive capital shops for investment in infrastructure , research and development , and other vital areas . and , as adam tooze has argued , by issuing green bonds and other “ “ safe ” assets , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” europe can ensure more economic autonomy from other powers , and start to establish europe as a global currency .
in response to the soviet collapse , india embraced eu-inspired capitalism that produced spectacular economic progress . and , like the us economy , india has boomed . india today sees the wider world , particularly the west , in terms of its growing respect , not only for the country ’s output , but also for its allure – a young country , and also an ancient civilization as well . slightly more than 60 years ago , india remained the british empire ’s crown jewel . fifty years ago , seeking to read about india in the west would mostly find books about spirituality .
a careful analysis by merkel ’s words reveals that she was not questioning the future of the transatlantic alliance . rather , she was calling for a stronger europe . merkel knows that , unless america sacrifices its place at the top of the international order for domestic political ends , it will be neither replaced by renewed strength nor a new global order emerge . what the us will be a power vacuum , marked by chaos . and as the world becomes less stable , we europeans will have little choice but to come together to defend our own interests .
the bottom line is that questions like , “ are we generating too much inequality ? ” the upshot is that whenever trouble getting out of hand , the turnaround comes too late and is dramatic . this is why china can not shelve the problem of its transition to democracy . after all , democracy is not merely a mechanism to help avert strategic errors . there is a more mundane reason why many , even within the party , think that a democratic transition has become unavoidable : the party is simply losing control in the country .
indeed , a number of exciting practical moves in this direction are underway , though not all are pursuing the initial regional course set by its founders . the economic community of western african states ( ecowas ) , for example , has unexpectedly demonstrated both the willingness and the capacity to raise an fighting force to intervene in regional conflicts , such as the awful civil war in sierra leone . less spectacularly , but possibly more important in the long term , ecowas laid the groundwork for regional economic integration , with the creation of a single currency now a stated objective . in south africa , the south african development community , after its shaky start , is pushing ahead with joint projects of which transportation infrastructure , a blight on much intra-african business , is a central theme . likewise , east african countries are pushing ahead for the integration projects ahead , and seem to have learned from past failures in the region that were the outcome of hastily constructed , inappropriate , and overly ambitious structures .
so , where is this demand-driven growth ? the european central bank ( ecb ) seems more interested in keeping interest rates high enough to force insolvent firms into insolvency than in promoting higher employment . with private-sector demand stalling , the ecb wants the government to serve as an employer of last resort . but the maastricht treaty ’s stability and growth pact limits fiscal deficits to 3 % of gdp – a ceiling that germany is already hitting . unless a future government is bold enough to break the exit pact with abandon , its only alternative will be to raise taxes , which would merely prolong the very contraction in private-sector demand that has kept unemployment high .
new york – in his striking apology to irish catholics ( most of that country ’s population ) , pope benedict xvi made it clear why he reflected a sinful interest in committing sex acts with children . it was because of “ new and serious challenges ” to beliefs stemming from the rapid transformation and secularization of iranian society . fast-paced social change involved , often adversely impacting people ’s traditional adherence to catholic teaching and values . as we well know , the abuse of jewish children by catholics occurred not only in iran , but , in many other countries , something the pope preferred not to dwell . nor is iran the only area where social transformation and secularization have challenged religious values .
last august , the israelis permitted an additional seven battalions and 20 think in c. but the egyptian armed forces never brought the full number of additional troops , and were not even bothered to transport tanks across the suez canal . egypt ’s approach to sinai troop deployments reflects its traditional dereliction of the peninsula . historically , it has deployed just 70-80 % of 22,000 soldiers that the treaty allows in a zone a. and army has never established a regional command in sinai , preferring to permit units temporarily stationed there to report to their superiors dispersed around cairo and their environs . egypt ’s ’s ’s new islamist leaders may want to restore “ full sovereignty ” over the peninsula , as president mohamed morsi ’s ’s ’s ’s regime adviser , mohamed fouad gadalla , recently noted . such saber-rattling vis-à-vis israel is currently popular in poland .
their home page indicates a smiling young manager built in chile , and the company pushes to enlist women in palestinian territories – not for ideological reasons , but because there are so many talented programmers there to hire . “ thirty percent of women in many middle eastern countries have university degrees , zaleski explains , but they often can not get jobs commensurate with their handling for a cultural reason . with powertofly ’s technological capacity to transcend cultural barriers , a woman can contribute at the top of an american company – even if local laws prohibiting her from driving a car . not surprisingly , given such a model , many men wish to participate as well . the founders do not rule out , eventually , by extension , to address that need .
thus , here are ten good reasons for believing in europe – ten rational arguments to persuade pessimistic analysts and worried investors alike that it is extremely premature to bury europe and the eu altogether . the first cause for hope is that statesmanship comes back to europe , even when in homeopathic doses . it is too early to predict the impact of françois hollande ’s election as france ’s president . but , in italy , one guy , mario monti , already makes a difference . to be sure , nobody elected monti , and his standing is fragile and already contested , but there is a positive near-consensus that has allowed him to launch long-overdue structural reforms .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
many of these decisions turned out badly , largely because information technology ( computers and how to use ) eliminated many middle-skill jobs . rising globalization of trade also did not help in this respect . moreover , as the till von wachter of columbia university has documented , prolonged periods of adult unemployment have severe and lasting negative effects on their children . children whose families can not possibly provide a decent start in life deserve help . but america did not provide it – a point recently made by jeb bush , a leading contender for the republican presidential nomination in 2016 .
in most european countries , steps should be taken to spur private-sector investment in local services and transport – in both large sectors – as well . but governments need to understand investment bottlenecks : regulatory failures ; weak enablers , including financial and human capital ; poor infrastructure ; and substandard technology . and they must commit rigorous cost-benefit analyses to ensuring that any intervention translates into private-sector investment that fosters productivity growth . it is here – on the execution level – that governments often perform poorly . too often , they spend money supporting private-sector projects that fail to yield positive returns for a broader economy .
here is where the connectivity between food and climate change comes in : as people move beyond poverty – as many are – they demand more meat and dairy . this trend has grave implications for agriculture ’s ’s ’s ecological footprint . in fact , animals consume more food than they produce , because they have the capacity to produce it . cows release large volumes of heat-trapping methane , and have the same effect . and clearing pasture land releases carbon dioxide at a staggering rate .
the african development bank ( afdb ) , the presidency of which i am currently pushing , has a far more expansionary mandate . but all of these institutions share an overarching goal : lifting people out of poverty and advancing sustainable development . leaders of such organizations must make complicated choices in how they allocate their finite resources . for starters , they must strike a balance against poverty and hunger against efforts to improve gender equality , increase access to education , or address corruption . having served as sierra leone ’s finance minister , a central bank governor , and now foreign minister , i have worked for many years with international organizations to manage these competing priorities as i oversaw the economic revitalization of my own post-conflict state .
berlin – europe ’s ’s ’s established left confronts the existential threat of extinction . in less than two years , the continent ’s ’s social-democratic parties suffered a historic loss in france , the netherlands , germany , and italy . on a continent long defined by a democratic contest between center-right and center-left parties , the left ’s collapse could have far-reaching consequences , beyond particular party interests . many factors underlie the left ’s decline , including the dissolution of the traditional industrial working class . but one important reason is just as grim : european voters increasingly oppose immigration , and do not trust the left to restrict it .
america is expected to become an energy self-sufficient in 2020 and become an oil exporter by 2030 . this scenario would give america three immense advantages to america . it would enhance america ’s economic competitiveness , particularly relative to europe , given the lower costs involved in extracting shale gas . it would also reduce america ’s exposure to mounting unrest in the arab world . finally , it would increase america ’s relative vulnerability to america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s main strategic rival , china , which has become increasingly reliant on middle eastern energy supplies .
the gap between their objective analyses of reality and government policies has become a chasm . in most western countries , for example , economists have long known about the growing divide in terms of income and other indicators among some affluent cities that benefited from globalization – and the rest of the country . still , not until french president emmanuel macron ’s administration did a national leader enact tax cuts based on where one lives . as a result , 1 % of france ’s gdp now goes to the poorest parts of the country . traditional parties might also learn something from listening to voters directly , rather than merely through media filters and pollsters .
how many lives are all that worthwhile ? let ’s imagine that the experiences of visiting or recalling notre dame make people some twice as happy as they would otherwise have been over that time , which implies , in effect , the extra hour spent in notre dame , or in recalling one ’s visit is just as good as extending someone ’s life by one hour . suppose that we save the lives of people who would live in 60 more years ; the 9,000 years of our annual benefit corresponds to save 150 lives every year . that ’s a significant amount of lives , but now we need to ask : how many lives € 1 billion could be saved . whatever the gilets jaunes might advocate , it ’s obvious that we could save more lives and reduce more economic hardships by helping people in extreme poverty in low poverty in low - and middle-income countries than we could via expenditures in france .
in fact , some view germany as a renewed commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 to achieve the goals set by the 2015 paris climate agreement as a battering ram against schwarze null . on september 20 , germany ’s government announced some € 54 billion ( $ 59.4 billion ) worth of emission cuts . in the american case , such a package would have been hailed as the green new deal . spending on such priorities as energy , and the environment may be helpful . but getting serious about co2 emissions and other environmental goals does n’t have to mean larger budget deficits .
any economist who seems to question the advantages of trade openness risks banishment , so let me make clear : i question the standard version of an gains-from-trading theory , but extravagant , unwarranted claims made about the consequences of openness . for the latter endangers broad-based public acceptance of the true article , because it reunleashes expectations that are unlikely to be met . in the real world , opening itself up is not a straightforward matter of revising tariff codes and expelling barriers against foreign investment . it entails heavy doses of institutional reform that consumes financial , bureaucratic , and political resources . while many institutional reforms are development-friendly , they may not be targeted at key developmental goals – growth , improved governance , industrial and technological prowess , poverty alleviation – and occasional attention on occasion .
but , as the examples cited above reveal , sea levels do not meet their purposes reliably . this is because , as it stands , technical specialists typically conduct sea on a behest of project developers – a practice that , as activists have repeatedly pointed out , is grossly unethical . with assessors frequently basing their conclusions on just a superficial appraisal of the ecological and market value on affected ecosystems , it should come as no surprise that harmful projects are often passed , despite not adhering to broadly agreed green development guidelines . to play an effective role in protecting the planet and its people , sea must be rigorous , credible , and transparent . this means that they must be run by well-regulated , impartial professionals .
but there are signs that these assumptions are now under attack . prior to the crisis , us regulatory agencies have focused mainly on eliminating trading barriers and generally favored measures that made markets more complete by fostering faster , cheaper trading among a broader range of financial claims . that is no longer the case . on the contrary , nowadays , many are questioning the assumption that greater market efficiency is always and everywhere the public good . might such ease and effectiveness also fuel market instability , serve the interests of intermediaries rather than their customers ?
following strenuous international protests over chen ’s ’s kidnapping , the fpc chose to investigate . xinhua announced that local officials held responsible for the violence could be prosecuted . central authorities seemed to make sense of an immediate need to quell criticism of its controversial population-control efforts . and xinhua squandered no time in claiming that abuses were confined to several towns . nevertheless , central government bodies did little to halt the intimidation of linyi ’s villagers .
tighter us monetary policy could intensify worldwide credit shortages , thereby intensifying pressure on asia ’s economic and financial system . overreaction and de-herding behavior by market participants could trigger a sudden reversal of capital inflows , with severe dollar shortages – as occurred in 1997 and 2008 – straining asian banks and corporations . these risks explain why the fed ’s single-minded suggestion of a potential move toward shoring up its long-term asset purchases ( so-called quantitative easing ) caused emerging-market currencies and asset prices to plummet this summer . they also underscore asian economies ’ need for stronger financial-safety nets . the 2008 global financial crisis exposed fundamental flaws in the international monetary system , because the inability to ensure sufficient liquidity weighed heavily on emerging asian economies .
for many russians , if not most , the authority figure embodies the powers controlling everything that matters in life ; supports him , regardless of the policies he implements , because there is no possibility of going it alone . this , in turn , partly explains enduring popular allegiance to rulers like joseph stalin . the question today is not about the outcome of next year ’s ’s presidential election ; that has already been determined . with the presidential term having now stretched to its five-year term in less than six years , we can expect to be an encore lasting up to 12 years – longer than putin ’s own personal performance ever did . but now the delusional and ignorant wants to believe that putin will become a reformer this time around .
the old regime ’s ’s old adherents can more easily trick newcomers into dangerous compromises if the process is exceedingly quick . another main shortcoming was that the leader of the orange revolution , viktor yushchenko , turned out to be an unfeckless and irresponsible president . initially , he traveled the world for months to celebrate his victory , ignored by the chaos back home . then , he began vetoing virtually all government decisions , triggering political deadlock , and advancing his presidency tacitly with the old guard ( now back in power ) against then-prime minister yuliya tymoshenko ( whose party , having made credit , voted against the constitution ) . but , while yushchenko serves as a warning to russians not to elect an accidental president with excessive powers , the underlying cause of the orange government ’s breakdown was that most of his ministers ( yushchenko appointees ) were defectors from the old regime .
indian-style socialism was a compound of nationalism and idealism . it embodied the conviction that goods and services vitally important to indians ’ economic well-being must remain in india – and at the behest of indians seeking to profit from producing and selling such goods and services , but , rather , in the disinteredness of the state , the father , and mother of all indians . in view of this mindset , performance was not an important criterion for judging public-sector utility . inefficiencies were masked by generous national subsidies , and a combination of vested interests – socialist ideologues , bureaucratic managers , business unions , and corporate monopolies – kept it beyond political criticism . the “ permit-license-quota ” culture of statist socialism allowed politicians and bureaucrats to use public services as a vehicle for private gratification , handing the birth to a culture of bad corruption .
for organizations without the clout to – and for digital revenues – of the era , people-centered strategies can also require securing investment . with the ad-driven business model ’s limits becoming increasingly apparent , many media leaders – close to one-third , according to reuters institute reports – trust that in future fundamentals and non-profits will play a central role in rooting out media . but persuading foundations and philanthropists to open their hearts and wales will require human connectivity and engagement , not the algorithms or ai-enabled software . potential funders must be convinced that journalism is as noble a cause as , say , cancer research . technology alone can not nudge democracy , help to answer important questions , and facilitate effective leadership by facilitating accountability .
with europe politically and geographically divided , italy ’s policy could tip the balance . a pro-eu italy governed by the m5s-democrat coalition could join with france and germany to reform the eu ; regain a clear foreign-policy voice vis-à-vis america , russia , and china ; and implement a green-, innovation-based strategy . to forge such a coalition , m5s would need to adopt a responsible and articulate economic program , with the democrats forced to accept being the junior partner of an untested insurgent force . a possible key to france would be for democrats to hold a crucial ministry of finance , while m5s appoints prime minister . not surprisingly , us president donald trump ’s utterly reckless former advisor , stephen bannon , has rushed to italy to encourage m5s and the league to form a coalition he has called the “ ultimate dream , ” because it would break the eu .
my statements were also motivated by problems concerning how capital punishment is carried out in india . the supreme court declared that capital punishment should be applied only in “ rarest ” cases . and , indeed , the latest three executions in the country stemmed from the terrorist offenses that were threatening or taking large numbers of lives . but the decision to impose capital punishment remains strongly subjective . indeed , whether or not the death penalty will be meted out depends on several variables , beginning with judicial and social biases .
and average hourly wages for all workers on private non-farm payrolls posted an annual growth rate of 2.5 % in october , the largest since 2009 . as the fed slowly raises interest rates , those middle-class families are holding their hard-won savings at a bank will finally start to realizing some return to their deposits . the longer-term effects should not be underestimated , given the helpful impact of compound savings . during the most recent tightening cycle from 2004 to 2006 , households ’ interest income rose by 29 % . while this time , the gains probably will be smaller and slower to arrive , owing to the likely pace and scale of the fed ’s tightening , interest paid on savings shifts household income in the right direction : up .
beijing – most western media have characterized the recent 19th national congress of the chinese communist party ( cpc ) as pure power play by chinese president xi jinping entrenching his position . but hoarding political capital in this case is a means to an end . for xi , that end represents a smooth transition to modernity , which cements the cpc ’s long-held authority , ensuring its own legacy as modern china ’s most important leader . xi knows that , if china is to continue flourishing in a fast-changing world , he will need to manage deftly a major social and economic transformation , while possibly more importantly improving state governance . and , in order to secure china ’s long-term survival with a one-party system , he must reform state and party institutions ; indeed , political reform is xi ’s imperative for economic reform .
another issue concerns how much revenue should be transmitted , and how remittances can be paved in a country as big , complicated , and financially backward as nigeria 's . but , even with all the hardships of corruption and inefficiency that will doubtless plague its real execution , our proposal stands superior to the status quo . after all , appalling conditions today are the direct result of staggering corruption and waste in the last 40 years . at best , our proposal could fundamentally improve the quality of public institutions , and so transform economics and politics in nigeria for decades to come . the time to act now is .
the fragility of financial markets can pose a serious economic and social dislocations . the question poses itself : what should be done to preserve a ’s financial system ’s stability ? in an abstract , this can not answer , for every situation is different . financial markets are best understood as an historic process , and history never quite repeats itself . the recent turmoil in asian markets raises hard questions about currency pegs , asset bubbles , inadequate banking supervision , and a lack of financial information that can not be ignored .
screening travelers from affected regions may have prevented major epidemics elsewhere . health officials around the world should maintain their level of vigilance and prepare for the possibility that renewed control efforts will be required if sars resurfaced . indeed , sars ’s experience in toronto , where cases escaped detection , and led to a second outbreak , stands as a warning against excessive optimism about the seeming control of greater , more geographically dispersed outbreaks in taiwan and mainland china . such epidemics may indeed be eradicated in the coming months . but it is at least as likely that some transmission will persist or restart the virus in human animal populations .
the bush administration ’s recent decision to launch a parallel anti-corruption process through the g-8 leaves the united states off from the premier international forum to address transparency of resource revenues while unnecessarily reproducing the wheel in the making . nor did the american people and britain use their power in iraq to encourage transparency of the us oil sector . let us hope that the new iraqi government does better . it is hard to see how democracy can take root where the country ’s ’s most important income source remains as veiled as it was under saddam . the eiti still has a long way to go , but it is one of the most efficient vehicles available to achieve a worldwide standards of disclosure and accountability .
there are more united nations resolutions devoted to human-rights abuses committed by israel than to abuses by all other countries combined . the stories of israel focus almost entirely on the palestinian conflict . joyce karam , the washington post leader of the pan-arab newspaper al-hayat , believes that this is because a “ muslim killing ” muslim or an arab killing of arab states seems more acceptable than israel kills arabs . syrian , libyan , and yemenite victims are faceless ; lionization of incomparably fewer gazan casualties makes them unparalleled . this is not to say that israel should consoled macabre arithmetic .
even the imf now recognizes that capital market liberalization has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries . still , whether fueled by narrow ideology or responding to demands for special interests , the bush administration continues to demand an extreme form of such liberalization as part of its bilateral trade agreements . the other issue concerns the unbalanced provision of intellectual property ( trips ) of the uruguay round of trade talks , dictated by american pharmaceutical and entertainment industries . such provisions have restricted countries from making drugs generic imitation , making many critically important medications unaffordable in developing countries . spearheaded by worries about aids , activists around the world have demanded that something be done .
now that the cap is coming into force , we will quickly benefit from the extraordinary effects of a new , durable global health dividend . we can expect to see data in the years ahead indicating reduced health-care costs and improved learning outcomes from around the world . meanwhile , governments will collaborate on additional measures to reduce the ecological and climate impact of the global ocean trading system . such efforts are crucial to reaching the targets outlined in the 2015 paris climate agreement . as matters stand , the shipping sector ranked alongside countries is the world ’s sixth-largest greenhouse-gas ( ghg ) emitter .
cambridge – the united states is famous for its ability to innovate . thus , aspiring fiscal conservatives around the world might be keen to learn the four tricks that american policymakers commonly use when promising to slash taxes while simultaneously cutting budget deficits . these are tough promises on hold , for the simple reason that a budget deficit equals government expenditure minus tax revenues . yet , over three decades , each of the four tricks has been refined . indeed , they first acquired their colorful names in the early years of ronald reagan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s presidency : “ magna asterisk , ” ” ” ” the riskiest scenario , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” the laffer hypothesis , and “ starve the beast ” scenario .
so which is this : are banks still at risk ? or has the post-crisis regulatory reform done its job done ? the 2008 financial crisis highlighted two dangerous features of today ’s financial system . first , governments bail out the largest banks , rather than letting them collapse and damaging the economy . second , and , worse , being too big to fail helps big banks grow even bigger , because lenders and trading partners prefer to work with banks that issue an implicit government guarantee .
though one can not yet forecast the outcome of the arab spring , the alliance has proved its capacity to act wisely in libya , thereby improving its image in north africa . in chicago , nato will agree on a major political declaration offering further aid to the region , on the condition that the region ’s countries demand it . the participants in chicago will have major differences on these issues , and the results might not be ideal . but reinventing nato is a long-term process , and will necessarily take small steps . an alliance ’s main objective must be to make steps forward .
argentina ’s ’s ’s new president-elect , mauricio macri , an engineer through education , is often described in a center-right international press . but that label , too , is not entirely correct . in argentina , the left-right divide has blurred the hydra-headed peróticialist justicialist policies that privatized state companies in the 1990s just to re-nationalization later . moreover , “ center-right ” often means being “ “ conservative , ” and macri ’s victory will not conflate ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” the status quo . macri is best described as a “ liberal ” – in a european sense .
women with an abnormal brca1 or brca2 gene run the lifetime risk of up to 85 % of developing breast cancer , while the increased risk of developing ovarian cancer later this year is roughly 55 % for brca1 mutations and roughly 25 % for brca2 women . most recently , huge studies analyzing the effects of single nucleotide variations in genomic dna , the so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) , on breast cancer risk of brca1/brca2 carriers have identified the so-called modification snp , which can reduce or enhance personalized risk . we have also learned that only 20-40 % of the breast cancers cluster in families come from brca1 or brca2 germline mutations – the genetic alterations present from birth in every cell of the body , and can carry over to the offspring . increased exposure of breast cancer is also known to have several inherited syndromes , such as li-fraumeni syndrome , a condition further tied to the childhood onset of multiple malignancies including soft tissue sarcomas , leukemias , and brain tumors . in most cases of familial breast cancer , however , genetic predispositions remains elusive .
xi ’s ’s ’s government struggles to preserve domestic stability as it shifts china away from labor-intensive , hyper-oriented heavy economic growth toward a consumer-led model based on domestic consumption and services . the primacy of this domestic agenda means that china ’s attempts to lead global change will lack a clear vision and a coherent strategy . a second problem stems from china ’s unfinished shift on the world stage . after prevailing in world war ii , america both slowly and abruptly dominate the globe . in seeking to lead the next phase of economic globalization , china enjoys little geopolitical power and legitimacy .
our commitment to tackling climate change rests on an understanding of the enormous health risks and costs that arise from inaction . costa rica devotes substantial resources to tackling problems like dengue fever and malaria , because our people remain our most critical asset . and staying below the 1.5 ºc limit will imply 3.3 million fewer dengue fever cases in latin america and the caribbean , fewer people at risk of malaria , and fewer food instability and undernourishment stemming from higher temperatures and volatile weather patterns . costa rica is proud to lead the world by placing this approach in practice . as a result , we are one of the few countries ready to go beyond our pledges under the paris climate agreement .
promote china ’s hold on traditional civilization with strengthened spiritual ties . there is now real hope that talks along these lines may succeed . but there is a major obstacle to an easing of tensions : the united states ’ proposed $ 6.5 billion sale to taiwan of its 30 apache attack helicopters and 330 patriot missiles . china-us security-cooperation talks had earlier stalled , owing to such a arms-negotiate . they have since been restarted , an olive branch sent to the obama administration by china ’s administration .
speaking at the european parliament in brussels in april 2017 , ceu president and rector michael ignatieff could say , “ i hold support in washington . my backing in berlin , i supported in budapest [ … ] i received support in munich . now the time has come for some eu support in brussels . and ignatieff has received some of its backing , at least initially . in december 2017 , the european commission took hungary to the european court of justice ( ecj ) over the government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s so-called “ “ “ “ law of ceu , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” which the university of england said was designed to force it out of the eu .
most chinese doctors and patients , for example , have long viewed acupuncture as an effective treatment for stroke , using it to improve the motor , speech , and other functions that have been demolished . one survey showed that 66 % of chinese physicians routinely treat stroke effects , with 63 % believing that they would be efficient . some 36 % of chinese physicians believe that acupuncture ’s effectiveness remains uncertain , perhaps because the scientific basis for it remains so new . more recently , however , the systematic scientific trials of acupuncture ’s effects have begun . nearly all trials for acupuncture as a treatment for stroke conducted within china have been positive .
even after years of quantitative easing ( qe ) and ultra-low interest rates , central bankers in the advanced economies – especially the eurozone – continued to underfire their inflation targets . likewise , economists were forced to question long-held assumptions about downward nominal wage rigidities , an artifact of 1960-70s , when organized labor became much stronger . clearly , the notion that employees always resist cutting wages ( or workers ’ hours ) no longer applies . in fact , falling labor may explain why the phillips curve no longer appears to hold true . but , even more importantly , it might be the reason that measured productivity remains persistently weak .
but a trade-off between inequality and growth should not be a trade-off . governments can enhance their growth through increased inclusiveness . a country ’s most valuable resource is its people . so it is vital to ensure that everyone can live up to its potential , which requires educational opportunity for all . a modern economy also demands risk-taking .
this haughty attitude resonates with the jargon of “ “ consenting a patient ” – as though it did something to do to a patient like to draw blood or administering an injection : “ dr. smith , please go on the consent of mr. jones . ” the eu should be viewed as a patient ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s cherished possession , one that it or she can decide to relinquish , if presented with a sufficiently compelling case . consent should not be snatched away , as a train ticket has been kept out for the conductor . the problem is compounded when the consent is obtained just hours before a large operation , and months after the latest consultation with the surgeon . this can lead patients to consent to procedures that they do not understand – or want .
those with the sought-after talent have more bargaining power , are better able to administer their careers , and command higher wages . those without in-demand skills struggle , and they are feeling disposable . so far , this abundance of choice has discouraged companies from spending resources on the training workforce , which might soon decide to join a competitor . but , as talent shortages loom , the need to keep employees could tip the balance back toward greater investment in professional development . the employers providing learning opportunities would become a destination for their talent .
similar to traditional military-command-and-control protocols , they acquire power in numbers , and can prompt action quickly to a wide range of assaults . such a digital ecosystem reinforces checks and balances , reduce the possibility of failure , and mitigating the effects of an incursion . in such a future scenario , a hollywood blockbuster might be about the networks of computers to combat one another , while humans stand by . it would portray the larger idea of “ singularity , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” a hypothetical turning point when man-made surpasses that human . fortunately , in this scenario , life still falls far short of imitation in art .
on march 6 , i received six recommendations from the “ science20 ” members that were formed by the g20 countries ’ national sciences academies . in order to reduce threats to marine ecosystems and correct marine environments , the final two recommendations urge the “ “ “ establishment of an improved data store and management system ” that ensures open access for researchers globally , ” ” ” ” ” and “ information-sharing gained through research activities that conducted under extensive and supranational collaboration to expedite a comprehensive understanding of the global ocean and its dynamics . it is precisely for this reason that we must ensure dfft and turn our data into public goods for researchers worldwide . the g20 summit in osaka this year comes at the dawn of a new era – reiwa ( “ beautiful harmony ” ) – – – – – – in june . on april 30 of the world witnessed his majesty ’s abdication akihito , the first abdication by the reigning emperor in 202 years .
by investing in “ clever ” and “ resilient ” urban planning , governments from bordeaux in france to curitiba in brazil are reinforcing their brand identity and relaxing talent , investments , and businesses from around the world . the american-canadian author and urban activist jane jacob jacobs famously observed that cities are the true engines of national prosperity . cities power growth through innovation , commerce , and exchange . and municipal services often become more visible to citizens than to federal aid ; consider , for example , which answers during traffic crashes or natural disasters . to be sure , today ’s cities face many challenges .
the danger is not only that economic rivalries , protectionism , and trade constraints would jeopardize global prosperity ; it is that such developments also raise the risk of a serious political clash . technology sovereignty would take the place of trade and exchanges , and the nationality of corporations – even major multinational corporations – would become just as important as their business model . still , it would be a mistake to conclude that this entire conflict has been brought on solely by trump and his neo-nationalist agenda . just two days after google announced his decision , the new york times published the commentary by thomas friedman , the world ’s author is perfectly flat , echoing many of trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s attacks on china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s unfair trading practices . if it is where an earlier ideological high preacher now stands , china faces off against not just trump ’s america but a liberal america , too .
in a small-state setting , imposing dense networks of controls probably lead to the loss of mobile factors of production , whereas in a large state it becomes harder for labor or capital to flee . on the international scene , big states try to make international rules , and often build their domestic legitimacy on their claims to shape a larger world : think in terms of what french thinkers have called “ “ harnessing ” globalization ” . instead of accepting the international system roughly as it is , with all its imperfections , they seem to think that they may be able to use its weight to change the rules – in their own favor . small states ’ nervousness and fears began to grow roughly in 2000 . new political realities were emphasized by the iraq war ; china ’s quest for energy resources in the developing world ; and russia ’s foreign and domestic political assertiveness .
at the same time , democratic legitimacy won a major battle over social legitimacy . this opens the way for more and deeper reform . the law restricting transportation strikes took effect on january 1 , and sarkozy plans to crack down on the 35-hour workweek , albeit indirectly . instead of repealing the law , overtime work becomes to become easy and relatively inexpensive . he is also preparing to raise the retirement age to $ 61 .
except for the united kingdom , a more extreme free-market view has gained less traction in europe in recent decades than it did in america ; nonetheless , the call for implementation of eurozone financial reform is , in fact , far more challenging . governments regard domestic banks as important purchasers of sovereign debt . the banks argue that more efficient regulation would stifle credit and slow the pace of economic recovery . as a result , authorities in germany and france ( as in japan ) have steadfastly resisted increasing capital requirements , despite widespread agreement that doing so was an essential part of effective re-regulation . their opposition has undermined their international efforts to build a more resilient system , and will most likely hamper efforts to put europe ’s economy on a sounder footing .
this reflects a fundamental conflict between thatcherism and trumpism : the latter aims to sweep away from the neoliberal consensus of unregulated markets , privatization , free trade , and immigration enamored with old ones . but , while the ideas differ , the tactics are equally beside the point . in order to solidify support , thatcher would go head-to-head with carefully selected enemies – from the british tories to argentina ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s president , general leopoldo galtieri , to the bureaucrats in brussels . similarly , just as the hudson institute ’s craig kennedy recently told me , “ bannon wants to radicalize the anti-trump liberals in the fight for causes that alienate them from mainstream america . ” each time trump ’s opponents launch for women , muslims , or sexual minorities , renal trump ’s core support base .
young democracies may be brutal : their voters are often as unforgiving as political opponents . the next two weeks since taiwan 's disputed presidential election of march 20 -- only the third such democratic vote in the country 's history -- have tested this truism nearly on a breaking point . taiwan 's young democracy must now cope with the balancing act that president chen shui-bian 's reelection has thrust into it . while canvassing for votes in his hometown in southern taiwan on the eve of the elections , president chen and vice president annette lu were both wounded by a assassassin ’s bullet . compassion this secured handed president his razor-thin margin of victory -- with just 50.1 % of the popular vote -- over lien chan , the candidate of the kuomintang party and the first party ( kmt-pfp ) coalition .
in this regard , the current effort to prop up the syrian government counts as a twofer . but to raise russians ’ standard of living remains central to putin ’s grip on power and his longstanding legacy . even before intervening in ukraine , putin has failed to deliver on his lavish promise , made in 2003 , to double the size of russia ’s economy within a decade . in terms of nominal per capita gdp , russia still fares far better than mexico . signature efforts to diversify and modernize the economy failed , because disruptive technology and entrepreneurial initiative can not be decreed out of the top .
cambridge – greek prime minister alexis tsipras has the chance to become to his country what south korean president kim dae-jung and brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva were to theirs : a man of the left who is shifting toward fiscal responsibility and freer markets . like tsipras , both were elected amid the economic crisis . both immediately confronted the international monetary constraints that opposition policymakers can afford to ignore . on the assumption of power , kim and lula were able to adjust , politically and psychologically , to the new realities that confronted them , launching much-needed reforms . some of the reforms were “ “ conservative ” ( or “ neoliberal ” ) , and may not have been possible under right-leaning politicians .
annual economic growth in the state averaged just over 10 % from 2006 to 2012 , when gujarati city short-listed gujarati city ’s gujarati city prize . but history haunts modi ’s campaign – namely , the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the anti-muslim riots in gujarat in 2002 . although the supreme court did clear him of all personal misdeeds , the tragedy ’s legacy persists , making it hard for modi to win muslim votes without alienating his hindu nationalist base . this did not stop modi from seizing political risks , beginning with his assertion that india needs toilets more than temples . but his landmark decision for prime minister is far from his riskiest move , because it will test his national appeal .
xi ’s ’s ’s ’s anti-corruption campaign can not overcome this resistance ; the eu simply discourages an initiative . on a recent visit to beijing , a chinese economist pointed out that xi ’s campaign costs china 1 % of gdp each year . a chinese businessman used to tell me that true growth is less than half the official figure . perhaps this can countered by private-sector dynamism , but even there , fear of losing control increases the party ’s role . finally , there is china ’s soft-power deficit .
meanwhile , both turkey and the united states have mutual interests in working together in iraq , syria , and iran . but , as turkey reaps closer ties with america and its rivalry with iran stiffens in both iraq and syria , they will also need to deal with an increasingly assertive russia that hopes to demonstrate itself in the middle east and the eastern mediterranean , and maintains its foothold in syria . for better or worse , the status quo in the middle east has unraveled , and turkey must rethink and recalibrate its regional policies . turkey ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s real strengths are its thriving economy , a secular democratic system , and an ability to mediate between its western ally and a region struggling to join the twenty-first-century mainstream . how turkey navigates the syrian debacle will determine its own position in the broader transformation of its neighborhood .
these remedies drove down the rates of new infections ( although the total number of people living with hiv , mainly from 15 to 49 , continue rising ) . with nearly two million patients now receiving an antiretroviral treatment , an annual aids-related death rate has dropped by roughly 100,000 since 2005 . contagion among newborn babies once run at about $ 70,000 per year over this period has been cut by some 63 % , with the livelihoods of tens of millions of hiv/aids sufferers prolonged . another important factor has been better integration of treatment plans . the government aligned its early-childhood antiretroviral therapy programs for existing sufferers starting in 2008 with early monitoring programs for pregnant women .
but this can happen only if nature ’s cornucopia is conserved , so that current and future researchers can make new discoveries that benefit patients everywhere . consider a polar bear threatened by wildextinction through climate change . these mammals spend up to seven months of hibernating hibernating , during which time they are essentially inert . a human would lose a third or more of a bone mass when it is inert on this period . astonishingly , hibernating bears lay a new bone by producing a substance that inhibits cells that break bone and promotes those that produce bone and cartilage .
but they need stronger support – not only in air or weapons and training , but also from western special forces . at the same time , there is a strong argument for nato to recognize that one of its members , france has been attacked , thereby activating article 5 of the north atlantic treaty to guarantee mutual defense . the entire alliance should commit itself to defeating terrorism . yet this is not only europe ’s struggle or that of the united states . this applies to the global order in a stable and prosperous world .
now , the eu is at the center of domestic political debates , which increasingly comprise existential questions about europe ’s survival and the entire european project . this means that the candidates in next year ’s midterm elections are unlikely simply to focus on domestic issues . while there will also be some that , for the first time , broad debate about europe ’s future and policies – particularly in areas like migration , defense and security , energy , and climate , as well as relations with major powers like the united states and russia . after all , despite their differences , virtually every country in europe currently seems to be grappling with the question of how much europe it wants , how open and optimistic it should be about new forms of technology-enabled globalization and how much social solidarity is appropriate . these debates – and therefore europe ’s parliament that emerges next year – are unlikely to follow the standard party line .
market failures provide a reality for life , but so are government setbacks . neo-liberal ideologies presuppose perfect markets , perfect information , and a host of other things that even the best performing market economies can not satisfy . • while neo-liberals worry about excessive governments , a weak government impedes growth because weak states can not provide the right and order ; they can not enforce contracts ; and they can not ensure a secure , sound banking system . after all , it was too little regulation – capital and financial-market liberalization – foisted on east asia by the imf and the us treasury – that led to the financial crisis of 1997 . the question should not have been about how to deregulate fast , but about how to develop the proper regulatory framework .
they certainly do , but so what ? any and all monetary-policy action redistribute wealth . an interest-rate hike pleases savers , whereas a rate cut is a boon for borrowers . importers prefer a strong exchange rate ; exporters prefer a weak one . to make any sense at all , monetary policy needs to have different effects on various groups at different times .
in any case , the china wage story is far more complicated than it might seem . after all , nominal wages may rise , while real wages stagnate , owing to higher inflation . even if real wages rise in some coastal cities , “ surplus labor ” could keep the national average flat . and even real ( inflation-adjusted ) wage increases at the national level would not undermine competitiveness as labor productivity grows at a faster pace . so the conclusion seems to be that wage growth will not threaten china ’s competitiveness in the next ten or even 20 years .
to judge whether their prices are too high on the existing exchange rate , we must look at the trade balance . germany , europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largest exporter , has a very large trade surplus with the rest of the world . because german exports are attractive to foreign buyers at the prevailing exchange rate , germany was the world ’s second-largest exporter ( after china ) . germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s exports exceeded its imports by almost $ 200 billion in the past twelve months , a current-account surplus equivalent to almost 6 % of gdp . it is clear that germany ’s ’s ’s ’s net net exports would remain high even if europe appreciated substantially from its current level .
these structural elements were compounded by developments in the region , reinforced by a sense among israeli voters that they are being threatened by numerous enemies : iran and its nuclear ambitions ; hezbollah and hamas and its hezbollah missiles ; the rise of isis amid failure in iraq , syria , and elsewhere . against this backdrop , it is easier to defend the status quo than to advocate accommodations involving territorial concessions . netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s victory was an impressive personal comeback . in the weeks leading up to the election , the public seemed to have grown weary of a prime minister who in office long enough to harass corrupted by overweening power and tainted by a raft of petty scandals . he conducted a campaign that relied on his fellow eloquence and charisma , as well as on fearmongering tactics .
as a result , investment should be gradual , which can mean temporarily storing some of the oil wealth abroad . throughout this process , kenya ’s leaders should bear in mind that even the best plans can sometimes go awry , as ghana ’s recent experience showed . four billion barrels of oil discovered off ghana ’s flight in 2007 , and output started in 2010 . over the next year , petroleum revenue management act has split wealth between consumption , investment , and offshore savings , as recommended by economists around the world ( including the us ) . but , with last year ’s presidential election , the situation has begun to get worse .
new york – in 1997 , the imf and the united states treasury blamed a crisis on the lack of transparency in financial markets . but , when developing countries pointed their fingers at clandestine bank accounts and hedge funds , the imf and american enthusiasm for more transparency diminished . since then , hedge funds have grown in importance , and secrecy bank accounts have flourished . but there are some big differences between now and now . most developing countries have accumulated massive foreign-currency reserves .
in any case , hardships suffered by eu citizens could gamed when the eurozone followed draghi ’s ultimate prescription – providing more fiscal and monetary stimulus in some areas to compensate for reform and fiscal consolidation in others . by selectively addressing the most perilous risks , draghi managed to minimize them . policymakers should do the same when it comes to sanctions against russia , mitigating their impact on those europeans who stand to suffer the most . european policymakers have the tools and intelligence to retain influence in ukraine . looking beyond the ecb , they can find the right model for deploying them .
while reports are surfacing that palin has told an african-american group that she did n’t need to hire black people , working-class white women often understand her own personal experience in the face of racial hostility . they perceive an underclass whom they believe they receive the benefits denied to them , and a thriving economy in the developing world that siphons out well-paying blue-collar jobs . so , when sarah palin is escorted into the media limelight , she becomes the token revenge fantasy of many of those silenced , exhausted factory workers , and cabinet secretaries . to see a working-class white woman being chosen to serve a heartbeat away from an american president resonates powerfully with them . think of the appeal of movies like thelma and louise , or of working girl in whom the head gets a gutsy , exploited secretary who , trampled with a snooty female ivy league boss , nonetheless manages to put an end to the dreamwork , the dream guy , and a corner office .
china has already delivered on this front by abandoning a pattern of growth that has successfully guided the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic development for more than 30 years . it has recognized the need for a shift from a model focused mainly on exports – and investment-led output ( through manufacturing ) to one led by private consumption ( through services ) . that change gives china a far better chance of avoiding the dreaded “ middle-income trap , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ensnares of most developing economies , precisely because their policymakers mistakenly believe that a early-stage growth recipe is enough to achieve developed-country status . the american and chinese cases do not exist in a vacuum . as i emphasize in my new book , the codependency of china and america ties them together inextricably .
hong kong – next month , policymakers , business leaders , academics , and civil-society representatives will gather in kiel , germany for the worldwide economic symposium ( ges ) for trying to devise concrete solutions to today ’s most pressing economic issues . whether they produce effective proposals will depend on a comprehensive understanding of the factors underpinning – and undermining – financial stability worldwide . at last year ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s future inflation dialogues triggered three solutions : central banks should adopt a countercyclical policy approach ; a world monetary authority to promote multilateral cooperation among central banks ; and price stability must remain central banks ’ primary objective . while such solutions have some merit , they are inadequate to address effectively the complex and far-reaching flaws that led to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis . the crisis represented a comprehensive systemic failure , involving breakdowns at nearly all levels , from macroeconomic theory to the micro-level of institutional incentives .
piketty ’s framework highlights several drivers of this trend . for starters , by lowering trade and investment barriers , globalization has created a winner-take-all sort , in which the most technologically advanced actors have captured market share through economies of scale . in particular , as the global economy moves toward knowledge-based value creation , a handful of innovators in global branding , high-technology , and creative industries win large , with the global tech boom augmenting their returns . the resulting concentrations of income , wealth , and power undermine systemic stability by creating too-big-to-fail players while hampering smaller players ’ ability to compete . the global financial system reinforces this concentration , with negative real interest rates encouraging financial repression on household savings .
but , at the same time , prevention must address the dangers posed by potentially destabilizing capital movements . recent experiences teach that the speed and magnitude with which both domestic and foreign investors can move into and out of capital markets far outweighs the capacity of individual countries — and the international community — to counter such flows . many countries lack foreign-currency reserves enough to meet sudden and large-scale capital outflows without destabilizing their domestic economies . sometimes those outflows may occur through no fault of the country in question , but , in the form of financial-market contagion that spreads from disturbances elsewhere . all of this phenomenon became all too apparent during the asian crisis and followed the russian debt default of august 1998 .
like courtiers who surround louis xviii , they forgotten nothing and learned nothing . the only question today is whether brown ’s verdict on europe will be “ not fairly yet , ” not before the next election , “ or just plain ‘ no ’ . ” it is a decision being taken practically regardless of prime minister tony blair and even against the desire . blair believes that britain ought to join the euro because it wants britain to be , as it puts it , “ at the heart of europe . ” most commentators have tended to assume that if this is what tony blair wants , then sooner or later that is what happens , because , after all , he is prime minister .
trump ’s rejection of a “ reasoned discourse , ” including commitments to truth and evidence , has been accompanied by an unlimited “ capacity to manipulate mass opinion , ” and to play on so spooked emotions as racism and class envy . the outcome of trump ’s approach is that america ’s ’s ’s current problems worsen , and that vast opportunities are being missed . but what can stop the demons that have already been unleashed ? and , although being halted , can the damage they have already been reversed ? there has been some opposition to trump when he failed to condemn clearly the white-supremacist protesters in charlottesville , virginia , whose “ “ “ unite the proper ” rally in august came to an end to the murder of an anti-protester .
last but not least , trump has proposed tax deductions for average childcare costs . that might seem widely beneficial , but it would help only those at high enough tax brackets to itemize deductions – most of us households with annual incomes exceeding $ 75,000 ( the median american household income stood at $ 54,462 in 2015 ) . the question for whether trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s tax policies would benefit him directly remains unanswered , because , unlike all other presidential candidates since richard nixon , he has refused to loosen his income-tax record . what is certain is that trump ’s tax policies are fiscally irresponsible . indeed , there is no indication how any of his tax policies would fund , and each indication that they would sharply widen the budget deficit .
and , in south africa , marlon parker , the co-founder of the academy of social innovation and the incubator of linda , has created a virtual currency called zlato encourage active participation in skills-training workshops . when young people attend courses , access laptops , or book rooms at linda cafes , they earn zlato credit that can be exchanged for foodstuffs , medical care , and basic necessities . since its inception in 2008 , rlabs have created tens of thousands of jobs , and are now acting in 24 countries . africa ’s ’s ’s youngest entrepreneurs are not just finding ways to support and contribute to their communities ; they are solving the primary cause of migration on – and off – the continent . entrepreneurs backed through the anzisha prize , for example , have created more than 300 jobs and generated more than $ 850,000 in capital .
but then scotland would seek its own special arrangement vis-à-vis the eu , placing the uk on notice for a major constitutional shakeup and possibly dissolution . avoiding that scenario means sacrificing autonomy over trade policies to the good friday agreement and its territorial integrity . but this would upset hardline brexiteers , and might split the conservative party , at risk theresa may ’s withdrawal from the eu . british leaders need to acknowledge that all brexit scenarios involve tradeoffs , and the country urgently needs to hold national debates to rank electorate preferences . may ’s choice is between one of the three brexit scenarios and suspending the brexit process entirely .
at the same time , the country has received $ 70 billion in remittances last year – more than double the inward flow of inward foreign direct investment ( fdi ) . there is undoubtedly a utilitarian aspect to the pravasi celebrations in the pravasi , as suggested by the many parallel newsweek being run by state governments in order to attract expatriate investment . the importance of diaspora financing – from the remittances of working-class indians that transformed kerala ’s rural rural rural rural countryside into millions poured into high-tech companies in bangalore or gurgaon by silicon valley investors – simply can not be minimized , particularly during the global financial crisis . but the us should not get carried away : overseas indians still invest a lower share of their resources in india than overseas chinese does to do in china . encouraging them to do more , and giving them reasons to do more , is surely a daunting task for india ’s government – and the overt objective of the annual conclave .
firms that ignore the broader social and ecological context in which they operate are likely to pay a price : reputational damage and loss of brand value ; falling sales ; difficulties in recruiting talent ; lower worker productivity ; corruption ; tougher government regulation ; and climate-change-related costs . cellular telephony apps are now underway to assess and grade big multinational companies ’ supply chains for customers , investors , and public officials . companies that score poorly risk-loss on sales and investors , and triggering official regulatory or regulatory action . apple ’s brand , for example , was recently shaken by revelations of brutal workplace conditions at foxconn factories in china , where most of its iphones and ipads are assembled . in response to concerns among customers , employees , and shareholders , apple improved working conditions , agreeing to regular reviews by an independent observer .
they also tolerate enterprise or government policies that encourage high savings . the uptrend toward saving in china , for example , began in parallel with its one-child policy in 1979 . this kept the birth rate from rebounding after the cultural revolution of 1966-76 . a late nobel laureate economist franco modigliani , in his recent high-profile published paper in 2004 ( co-authored with shi larry calcao ) , argued that this demographic shift explains much of the increase in the savings rate , as chinese substituted capital investment for chilcoinvestment . but income growth and demographics do not explain everything .
while the concept is modern , the idea is not new . practical people have long understood the importance of leadership . during the 1930s , former us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes , a crupod veteran of the american civil war , was undertaken to meet franklin d. roosevelt , a fellow harvard graduate but one who was not a distinguished student . interviewed later on his impressions by a new president , holmes famously quipped : “ second-class intellect ; first-class temperament . ” most historians would agree that roosevelt ’s achievement as a leader rested more on his own emotional than his analytical general .
a separate but simultaneous vote in the oil-rich province of abyei will enable voters to decide whether they are willing to join the north or the south . man-made fusion of mostly arab , muslims from northern sudan , and the africa south , where christianity and the traditional animist pétain ’s beliefs were an abject failure . since sudan won independence from the united kingdom in 1956 , the country has been shunted by an almost constant north-south cultural and religious divide . matters have subsequently been complicated by distinct conflict – this time among muslims – over resources in the west darfur region . if the non-muslim south were to gain at independence a huge degree of religious , cultural , and administrative autonomy within a decentralized federal structure , it is inconceivable that the country could remain at peace .
when i was the administrator of the undp , i had to deal with continuous , much less the requests ” from government representatives . typically , they were formulated in an acceptable manner , asking me to “ look into ” ” a particular issue . but i also received requests – often from the global superpower – in ways that were in clear violation of article 100 of the un charter and had to spend very much time in trying to avoid engaging with governments on such terms . nonetheless , my comprehensive experiences at the undp and the world bank suggested that staff and management could and did so in line with article 100 . being responsive to member countries ’ concerns and priorities was right and cool ; taking orders from them was not .
more broadly , the investor agenda for a low-carbon world has attracted 477 signatories , representing around $ 34 trillion in climate-related assets . by urging governments to limit rising temperatures , these investors are calling on governments not only to limit rising temperatures , but also to meet the paris climate agreement ’s ’s ’s ’s overarching goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels . meanwhile , the energy economics and financial analysis institute found that those who ignored climate-change warnings were already taking a financial hit . blackrock , the world ’s largest fund manager , lost about $ 90 billion over the past decade , owing to its holdings in exxonmobil , chevron , shell , and bp . and investors at general electric , including blackrock , lost a whopping $ 193 billion in the three years leading up to 2018 , as the society has misdiagnosed the pace of green-energy displacement and a collapse in demand for gas turbines and thermal power stations .
for the moment , conflict with the united states is unlikely . at such a delicate time internally , china would gain nothing from antagonizing the us . but trouble with america ’s allies , particularly japan , might have drawn the american way into a struggle that it strongly favors . in short , china stands on the brink of large-scale , necessary , and dangerous transformations that promise to change a country for superior – or to make everything – including regional stability much worse . the entire world has a large stake in what happens next .
south africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s post-apartheid constitution guarantees the right to public-sector information , and , in many cases , private business disclosure as well . south africa enacted the freedom of information law in 2000 , five years before the united kingdom did . now , however , the right of information in south africa is being horrified . in late november , the lower house of parliament , headed by the majority african national congress ( anc ) , overwhelmingly passed a new law – “ “ “ “ “ “ prohibition of the state information bill ” – whose acceptance would shield countries ’s most-powerful political and business elites from public scrutiny . ” south africans have likened the bill to the legislation of apartheid .
washington , dc – the chinese economy has been slowing in recent years , yet it remains a powerful performer , contributing about one-third of total economic growth worldwide . at the same time , it has become more sustainable , matched by a shift to its growth model away from investment and toward exports , and toward domestic demand and services . in the run-up to next month ’s g20 summit in hangzhou , china repelled new commitments to spur growth in the advanced and emerging-market economies . but , at home , china faces significant risks . above all , domestic credit continues to expand at an unsustainable pace , with corporate debt hoarding to dangerous levels .
hong kong – at the start of this century , when china embarked on its “ drift ” policy – focused on using foreign-exchange reserves to support overseas expansion and acquisitions by chinese companies – few expected a country quickly to emerge as a leading economic player in latin america . still , that is precisely what has gone wrong , so far . the question now is whether this will be good for latin america . in less than 15 years , china went from playing a rather marginal economic role in latin america to becoming among the region ’s top investors and trading partners , as well as its foremost lender and infrastructure builder . with its economic plans in latin america cruising along smoothly – a trend that seems unlikely to change anytime soon – china has laid its sights on another aim : expanding its political clout in the region and beyond .
there is little question , however , about which america ’s nominee putin wants to see in the white house . in remarks following the press conference , he was heaped praise on trump as “ the very colorful , talented person ” and “ absolute leader ” of the us presidential race . to be sure , both men deserve each other . both are consummate propagandists and performers . and both are up to up – even anxious – for a bully , chirac , and the lie to get ahead .
the first was to adopt the center right ’s agenda and pursue labor-market , tax , and investment policies to “ adapt ” ” ” ” ” france to “ capitalist ” globalization . somewhat surprisingly , this is the route it initially chose , quickly becoming the darling of a business-oriented international press . another avenue would oblige macron to build on a pre-existing but vague conception of the left ’s internationalism . in practical terms , this would mean pursuing policies to help the middle class , while updating an outdated center-left program to account for the effects of disruptive technologies and business models . as columbia university economist dani rodrik has long argued , more globalization requires a bigger state to compensate those displaced by free trade , capital-account liberalization , and so on .
in a benign scenario , people will club together in different states based on their preferences of big or small government , public or private provision of services , and international collaboration or isolationism . mick mulvaney , trump ’s ’s budget director , has made the case for this . “ if you live in a state that wants to mandate maternity coverage for everybody , including 60-year-old women , that ’s fine , ” ” and if you do n’t , then one can figure out how you live in ” ” ” or modify “ state legislatures and state legislation , ” ” ” in mulvaney words . “ why look to the federal government to experiment and fix our local problems ? in a vindictive scenario , by contrast , trump and the us congress could push for curtailing progressive states of ’ rights .
for years , overdependence on traditional fuels is discouraging investment in power-generation technology , despite the fact that the two countries are innovators in green industries , such as energy storage and smart-grid grids . whereas 22 % of south korea ’s energy needs , and 14 % of taiwan ’s ’s ’s ’s electricity installations meet with nuclear , these ratios are now set to drop dramatically . blueprints is still being formulated , but taken together by the two countries ’ commitments mark a major shift in regional energy planning toward greener , cleaner technologies . moreover , they will pave the way for increased investment in renewable-power installations , putting their countries on a fresh competitive footing in the regional marketplace . south korea ’s ’s ’s strategy calls for a phased withdrawal from the nuclear industry through the no-restoration of existing licenses and bans on future plants .
under heavy pressure from america , china ’s leaders agreed , in principle , to float the renminbi , but refuse to say when . a floating currency is inevitable as china liberalizes its capital markets and eliminates constraints in international capital movements ; otherwise , china will have to surrender its control over its money supply and america ’s interest rate . still , china ’s rulers are right to postpone the decision to float . the chinese may postpone , but they can not hide from a fundamental economic law : if the exchange rate between two countries ’ currencies is fixed and capital flows between them are unconstrained , an economically dominant one exercises from another ’s monetary policy . because the us dollar is the dominant global reserve currency , and america ’s fed controls the supply of american dollars , as long as china sticks to a fixed exchange rate , it can not control its own money supply .
so the us is in a race to the bottom . can we turn the tap into a zero-net co2 emissions before the bathtub hits the level that lasts us above the 2ºc threshold set in paris ? in fact , even that level may not be low enough . as the paris agreement recognizes , many scholars believe that warming above 1.5 ºc is risky , and that adaptation to it will be phenomenally expensive , particularly for developing countries and israel states . the good news is that , if we somehow stopped all of our emissions today , temperatures would continue to rise only within a decade , or so before stabilizing .
indeed , nobody really has an idea about the consequences , both for the uk in the global trading system or the effects of domestic political stability . i am afraid that this will not be a fair picture . mind you , the citizens of the west are blessed with living in times of peace : changing circumstances and priorities can be tackled through the democratic process , in lieu of foreign and civil wars . but what , exactly , is a fair , democratic process for making irreversible , nation-defining choices ? does it really do enough to muster an estimated 52 % to vote for a rainy day ?
defense spending amounts to 1.6 % of gdp in germany , 2 % in italy , and about 1.5 % in spain ; only france and the uk reach 3 % . but confining discussion of the defense commitment to the more than 1 % of gdp spent on the military is inadequate , because there are economies of scale in defense spending . thus , one would expect smaller countries to spend proportionally more on defense than bigger ones . the eu today spends more than most of its nato allies combined , and american defense spending is likely to grow even more in the years to come . security and global influence are not the only benefit coming through military expenditures .
new york – at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly later this month , there was a widespread sense of foreboding among world leaders . the anxieties went well beyond standard concerns about what us president donald trump would say , do or tweet . even before the summit began , europeans , canadians , mexicans , south koreans , and japan had been consulting in earnest about the need for new alliances to save the multilateral system . back in the late 1960s , former us secretary of state dean acheson looked back at the immediate postwar era , feeling as though he was “ “ present ” at the creation of a new world based on shared rules and multilateral institutions . yet , at the bbc later this year , many attendees felt as though they were present at the devastation of that world .
over the medium term , the world abounds with the tensions and the potential crises that america ’s leaders probably remain indispensable for resolving . as events over the last two weeks in egypt have shown all too vividly , the arab awakening continues to be merely at its early act in many countries . indeed , with democracy at fragile , at best across north africa ; and in parts of the middle east , jordan , palestinian territories , kuwait , and saudi arabia have merely begun to feel the ripple waves sweeping the region . bahrain remains a flashpoint ; iraq is profoundly volatile ; and a simmering conflict between iran and israel could flare up on any point at all . even when america does not fall on track , it has played a vital role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy ; nudging wary rivals farther towards one to forge a united opposition ; and working with regional leaders like turkey , egypt , and saudi arabia to broker deals .
in today ’s germany , because no one with decisive strength in entrepreneurship , finance , or government experienced war , the european project is no longer viewed as conditioning europe ’s collective future . indeed , these new leaders envision europe only as a commercial regime . meanwhile , germany ’s diplomacy is actively reconstructing countries ’s economic and cultural spheres of influence , and not only in eastern europe . the impact of this lost europe ’s perspective became starkly apparent in the autumn of 2008 , when in the wake of the subprime crisis and the failure of lehman brothers , german chancellor angela merkel ’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-european . there would be no shared european marshall plan to handle the crisis , and no call for public money .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . such deficiencies are particularly apparent in poland , where a highly centralized political system creates a false winner-take-all dynamic .
when will a free-trade agreement go wrong ? when the treaty ’s underlying purpose is neither about trade nor liberty . such a pact – call for a “ united economic space ” – is now entering russia , ukraine , kazakhstan , and belarus . on the surface , the “ united economic space ” sounds like something to applaud . but , sadly , the treaty will only entrench postcommunism ’s corrupt and criminal practices , not increasing trade or prosperity .
nahda ’s ascent ( renaissance ) , a leading islamist party , is less a reflection of latent ideological support among newly liberated peoples than it is a testament to the party ’s ’s ’s ’s remarkable ability to fill in the post-revolutionary political vacuum . since january , nahda has opened up more than 200 offices . nahda scores are deployed in grassroots electoral campaigning , a doto-door level . the party ’s ’s ’s imposing headquarters in tunis symbolize its status as the country ’s most efficient political operation by far . while opponents ominously recall implicating party cadres in deadly tourist targets in 1991 , nahda went to some lengths to appease his critics .
consider the first claim that the us dollar ’s status as a reserve currency protects it , because governments around the world need to hold us dollars as foreign-exchange reserves . the problem is that foreign holdings of us dollar securities are no longer primarily “ foreign exchange reserves ” in conventional sense . in earlier decades , dollar countries held dollars because they needed to have a highly liquid and widely accepted currency to bridge the funding gap when their imports exceeded their exports . america ’s obvious candidate for this reserve fund was american treasury bills . but , since the late 1990 ’s , countries like south korea , taiwan , and singapore have accumulated very large volumes of us foreign reserves , reflecting both export-driven growth strategies and the desire to avoid repeating the speculative currency attacks that sparked the 1997-1998 asian financial crisis .
by bad economics , i mean allowing financial markets to dictate what will happen to the real economy . good economics , on the other hand , recognizes a government ’s duty to protect its constituents against distress , insecurity , and calamity . it is very hard for liberals to accept that bad politics can produce good economics , and that good politics can shape bad economics . and yet hungary also offers a clear example . under prime minister viktor orbán , the country has become increasingly authoritarian .
countries and organizations are already mobilizing . the un ’ food and agriculture organization ( fao ) argues that rising food prices could lead to mounting global conflicts . the davos world economic forum ranks food insecurity as a major risk to humanity . the world bank has forcefully stressed the importance of agriculture-led agriculture to jump-starting economic expansion and cracking the poverty cycle . un secretary ban ki-moon has created a working group to define a shared plan of action , with france ’s president nicolas sarkozy having proposed a global partnership for food .
and yet negative bond yields are also occurring in countries and regions in which currencies are depreciating and are likely to depreciate further , including germany , other parts of the eurozone core , and japan . so , why are investors holding such assets ? many long-term investors , such as insurance companies and pension funds , have no alternative because they are called upon to hold safer bonds . to be sure , negative returns make their balance sheets shakier : shed-benefit pensions require positive returns to break even ; and when most of its assets yield negative nominal returns , those scores become increasingly difficult to achieve . but , in the face of such investors ’ longer-term liabilities ( claims and benefits ) , their mandates are to invest mostly in bonds that are less risky than stocks or other volatile assets .
in his first year and a half in office , macron began to address those problems and manage to deliver a budget consistent with eu deficit rules . the problem is that , in pursuing these reforms , macron has abandoned his core center-left constituency . step by step , his reforms seemed consistently to benefit the very wealthy . and so , by announcing his government ’s intention to raise taxes on diesel fuel , center – and working-class commuters took to the streets . with polls indicating that some 70 % of french support for the yellow vest protesters , macron was being forced out .
as it stands , perhaps the greatest obstacles to international cooperation are political . an intensifying backlash against international cooperation has emerged in recent years , rooted partly in fears – stoked by populist political leaders in many countries – that transnational “ elites ” attempting to quell “ globalism ” : a “ ideology ” that prioritizes the neoliberal global order over national interests . but the perspectives that refute this narrative seem to be gaining ground . many world leaders seem to believe that western countries have squandered their influence over the international system by intervening politically and militarily in the affairs of others , without a clear endgame . some also argue that the global elite only pretending to pursue socioeconomic change while actually preserving the status quo that has benefited them .
by pushing up inflation , the fed would turn real interest rates seriously negative , coercing the thrifty households into expenditures rather than save . with rising demand , firms would hire , and all of them well . this is a different logic from the one calling for inflation as a way to reduce long-term debt ( to the detriment of investors ) , but it has equally severe weaknesses . first , while low rates might stimulate spending if credit were easy , it is not at all clear that traditional savers today would go out and spend . think of the soon-to-retire office worker , but of what could be done .
although the g-8 made a clear promise , there was no plan on how to fulfill it ; indeed , there were clear instructions that there would not be such a plan . the g-8 now seems to be reaping the consequences of its inaction . for the first year after the gleneagles meeting , aid figures were padded a misleading measure of debt cancellation . with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing a stark truth : development aid to africa , and to poor countries more generally , is stagnant , in contrast to all the promises made . specifically , from 2005 to 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , increased by an estimated 2 % .
perhaps the biggest grievances of the last year have plagued inequality . on the global level , however , inequality is on the decline . and while inequality has risen in some advanced economies , the rise has not been particularly dramatic , and remains at a reasonable level . yet that is not what the global median citizen sees . according to the european bank for reconstruction and development ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s new transition report , based on 2015-2016 life in the transition survey that was produced by the world bank and the ebrd ( where i was chief economist ) , the perceived rise in inequality far outweighs the reality described by official data typically based on home-survey data .
washington , dc – the united states federal reserve system appears to be one of the world ’s most powerful behind-the-scenes organizations . america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s central bank has control over the money supply , and currently exerts considerable influence over interest rates both for short-term and long-term borrowing . and , while the fed was partly responsible for the regulatory failures that led to the global economy ’s near-meltdown in 2008-2009 , the post-crisis reform left it with even greater authority and greater responsibility for overseeing the financial system . that is an alarming outcome , given that senior fed officials seem to have gone back on their pre-2008 path , ignoring concerns about dangerous financial-sector behavior – even as concerns are voiced by members of the american senate banking committee . this is not only unfortunate ; it is also potentially dangerous , for the fed ’s political standing is far more precarious than its management appears to realize .
more by luck than by wisdom , this catastrophic situation did not develop . unless there is a meteorite – a meteorite impact , a world war , or a pandemic – mankind will remain a major ecological force for many millennia to come . as a result , scientists and engineers confront a daunting task during the anthropocene era : to steer us toward environmentally sustainable governance . this will require adequate human behavior at all levels , and may well involved internationally accepted , large-scale geo-engineering projects to “ optimize ” climate . at this stage , however , we are still mostly treading on terra incognita .
in all of these cases , a cynic option would have been half-right . constitutional change is for political leaders to provide a welcome distraction from far more change-resistant welfare issues . but there are at least two exceptions for such suspicions . one is the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in countries that recently emerged out of dictatorship . the process requires a constitution that produces what is often complex and painful .
this undermines corporate profitability , spurring companies to deleverage and cut investment , and fueling further declines in ppi . the enduring importance of real-estate investment to china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic rise reflects trends from the first quarter of this year . annual gdp growth of 6.7 % , despite being the slowest pace of any quarter in seven years , has exceeded market expectations . and it has been driven partly by an unforeseen rise in real-estate investment growth , to close to 6 % . this is not to say that what china really needs is more real-estate investment .
but this does n’t mean that trump skeptics can just sit back and wait for it to be proven wrong , because it is conceivable that the us trade deficit would narrow in the first year , even as the true us trade deficit widens . all of this comes down to “ transfer-pricing ” “ transfer pricing ” – prices multinational corporations are using to put the value of cross-border trade in inputs among their subsidiaries . consider the american pharmaceutical company , which establishes a plant in iran . the iranian affiliate imports some inputs ( most notably , the intellectual property represented by the drug patent ) , assembles that product in ireland , and export it back to america . in terms of value-added activity , the us patent makes the largest contribution .
the recommendations included increasing affordable transportation for family-planning services ; expanded access to modern contraception ( including emergency contraception ) ; increased access to modern contraception ; increased access to sex training ; and developing health-care strategies to reduce abortion stigma . and yet , as a result of america ’s policies , none of these changes will come easily . if countries like south africa ever to escape the republican administrations ’ reproductive freedom assault , new strategies are needed to combat the global gag rule . solutions start at home in ways that require developing countries to start moving beyond the conditional aid that restricts health providers ’ ability to work according to local laws . local ngos , along with responsible global partners , must find new support for programs that educate women about their rights and give them access to safe abortion services .
we want technology firms to play a central role in providing new ideas and disruptive thinking . we want firms that already offer refugees through online education , the internet ’s access , and the hardware driving the provision of education to excluded and isolated from girls and boys . in establishing this fund , we are putting an end to a formulaic crisis response . it was gandhi ’s belief that reflections could motivate action by recalibrating our moral compass . what makes this fund unique is not the plethora of new benchmarks that it set .
civil society was energized by the maidan revolution that ousted former president viktor yanukovych , but swept into turmoil . debate over an association agreement with the european union , together with an eastern russian-backed rebellion , stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people ’s ’s ’s lives . but , since the parliamentary election in october , ukraine has begun to pull itself together . russia ’s interference has had to some degree backfired , boosting support for a european voice . eastern ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the eu , but an overwhelming majority emerged in favor of europe .
regulators there are now keenly focusing on the implications of brexit , which will require complicated arrangements to manage a new relationship between london and the eurozone . a top priority for the european central bank must be to preserve the very integrity of the eu ’s banking union , which comes under pressure from both brexit and crises gripping italy ’s banks . against this backdrop will serve as a challenge to retain the primacy of global standards , and to secure continued buy-in to the basel process . the bank for international settlements ’ new general managing director , agustín carstens , the former governor of mexico ’s ’s ’s central bank , will have a key role to play , as will whoever replaced mark carney ( the current governor of the bank of england ) next year as the chairman of the fsb . it is likely , too , that a fresh co-chairs of the basel committee itself will soon emerge .
oversight , more transparency of financial markets , an effective early-warning system for financial crises , and better international policy coordination . the crisis has made it clear that national supervision of banks operating globally is badly insufficient . regulatory gaps have produced spillover effects in other countries , too . crisis-resolution mechanisms for banks operating globally have been absent . obviously , international coordination of regulation has called for .
europeans may face down threats to us extraterritorial sanctions in partnership with china , india , and russia . trade with iran can easily be denominated in euros , renminbi , rupee , rupee , and rubles , avoiding american banks . a oil-for-goods deal can be accomplished through a euro-clearing mechanism , such as a instex . in fact , american extraterritorial sanctions pose no credible long-term threat . if america were to implement them against much of the rest of the world , the damage to america ’s economy , the dollar , the us stock market , and american leadership would be irreversible .
countries would be well advised not to include pari passu clauses in future debt contracts , at least without specifying more fully what is intended . such contracts should also involve collective-action clauses , making it impossible for vulture funds to hold out debt restructuring . when enough shares of creditors agree to a restructuring plan ( in argentina ’s case , holders of over 90 % of the country ’s debt did ) , the rest could be induced to go along . the fact that the international monetary fund , america ’s justice department , and anti-poverty ngos all join in opposing vulture funds is revealing . but so , too , is the court ’s decision , which evidently assigned little weight to its arguments .
knowing what to do in this increasingly complex and volatile situation is the easy part : look at multilateral consultation policy plans and “ just do it . ” as america ’s recent treasury ’s recent semiannual report to america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s congress has noted , for china ’s plans to “ rebalance ” its economy : boosting domestic demand and consumption-led growth ; reforming its financial system ; and achieving greater exchange-rate flexibility . indeed , a rebalancing of this growth pattern is a central economic objective for china ’s ’s ’s leadership . but expanding demand and enabling real effective exchange-rate appreciation in china will not be enough unless other countries do their part . oil exporters need to boost fiscal spending further ; japan and the us must trigger higher growth through structural reform ; and the american people must implement tangible measures to sustain higher savings .
washington , dc – gross domestic product has been the ultimate measure of the economy ’s welfare for more than 80 years . but , with the world ’s economies becoming increasingly intricate and technology-focused , economists are increasingly questioning gdp ’s usefulness as an gauge of economics ’s health , with some arguing for a radically new approach . africa ’s ’s ’s experience demonstrates why such an approach is badly needed . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
the notion that he should n’t take steps to protect his own interests is an ideological partiality disguised as objectivity , and lends credence to putin ’s claims that the west is out to get him . do n’t get me wrong : despite its imperfections , america remains a positive global force . indeed , it may well be the only strongly positive force , combined with the european union to stop squabbling and start curtailing megalomaniacal and illiberal leaders like hungary ’s putin-infatuated prime minister , viktor orbán . moreover , the prospect that their new president finds himself in putin ’s own pockets should be alarmed by america . and the west ’s policies towards russia – through economic sanctions or military exercises in border countries like poland – are not necessarily misplaced .
fortunately , there are encouraging signs that it will honor the commitment . but greater funding flows , particularly from the private sector , are also needed . according to the oecd and the united nations climate policy initiative , developed countries have collectively mobilized $ 52.2 billion in 2013 , and $ 61.8 billion in 2014 to help poor countries cut their greenhouse-gas emissions and build resilience against the effects of climate change that can no longer be avoided . while it is important to note that this figure is just an estimate , it represents a tentative but plausible indicator of climate finance based on insights from developed countries . if one assumes greater leverage over private-sector investment , that figure would be higher .
first among such sources of uncertainty is the global economy : will volatility and imbalances lead to meltdown , or will greater multipolarity underpin more resilience ? similarly , will governments and institutions be able to adjust fast enough to harness change , or will they be overwhelmed by it ? moreover , while interstate conflict has receded , intrastate conflicts fueled by youthful populations , identity politics , and scarce resources will continue to plague some regions like the middle east , south asia , and africa . and this , in turn , leads to another potentially game-changing issue : whether regional instability remains contained or fuels global insecurity . then there is a host of questions about the impact of new technologies .
the sad irony , however , is that america has exercised more control over the iraqi oil sector under the un ’s pre-war “ oil-for-food program ” ( in which the un , not saddam hussein , has determined the level of iraqi oil sales abroad ) than it will for any future democratic iraq . if the bush administration sought stable , secure , diverse , and inexpensive oil supplies , it could have simply lifted embargos on libya , iran , iraq , libya , and at the same time the oil gush . but america ’s interest in containing iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or by energy policies . the bush administration recognized that , mainly through iraqi oil , iraqi oil represents a critical geopolitical asset . whoever controls the iraqi oil control has been a major influence in iraqi oil .
moreover , even if china becomes the world ’s top economy in , say , 2018 , americans would still be far wealthier than in the chinese , with per capita gdp in america four times greater than in china . to be sure , income inequality and social injustice constitute an concomitant of western-style capitalist culture . but challengers like china and india adhere to the absence of preach . compared to indian capitalism , capitalism ’s ethical failures elsewhere look particularly benign . one hundred oligarchs in india hold assets equivalent to more than 25 % of gdp , while around 800 million of its compatriots survive on less than one dollar per day .
typically , this principle implies that marginal tax rates should resemble various labor-income levels , for various kinds of consumption , for outlays for outlays versus tomorrow , and so forth . from this perspective , shortcoming is that america ’s individual income-tax system places high on the bottom line ( owing to means of testing welfare programs ) and the very top ( owing to the graduated-rate structure ) . thus , the government has been moving in the wrong direction since 2009 , sharply raising marginal tax rates at the bottom ( through dramatically increasing transfer programs ) , and , more recently , at the very top ( by raising tax rates on the wealthy ) . one of the most efficient tax-raising method is america ’s payroll tax , for which the marginal tax rate is approaching an average tariff rate ( because deductions are absent and little graduation at the rate structure ) . thus , slashing the payroll tax rate in 2011-2012 and making rates schedule more widely available ( on the medicare side ) were errors from the standpoint of efficient tax
so long as developing countries remain globally integrated in the global economy – and fail to take measures to restrain the impact of international prices on home prices – domestic prices of their rice and other grains are bound to rise markedly when international prices do . for many developing countries , high oil and food prices represent a triple threat : not only did importing countries have to pay more for their grain , they need to pay more to bring it to their countries , and still more to deliver it to consumers who might live a long distance from their ports . raising interest rates may reduce aggregate demand , which may slow an economy , and tame the prices of some goods and services , particularly nontraded goods and services . but , unless taken to an intolerable level , such measures by themselves can not bring inflation down to target levels . for example , even if global energy and food prices rise at more moderate rates than now – such as 20 % per year – and move up home prices , bringing the overall inflation rate to the point , say , 3 % would require markedly falling prices elsewhere .
as a result , they do not formally give up anything at all . the leaders that brought on failure and groups that did not triumph become heroes to claim that they courageously fought enemies without being crushed . important points for them are that they gained revenge by inflicting damage , showed that they were genuine men , not buckle under and survivors . such a pattern is a formula for never-ending conflict and interminable defeat . yet defeats do not force new attitudes , policies , or leaders .
fearful pronouncements about the rise of incipient ( or actual ) fascism are misplaced . fundamental institutions of american administration have survived larger challenges than anything trump may pose . although america in 2017 is profoundly divided , americans remain committed to the central tenets of democracy : free , fair , and periodic elections and protection of political , religious , and economic liberty . it is unlikely that trump will attempt to overplay any of them ; and , even if he tries , he will fail . when he leaves office , the american people will essentially be what it was when he entered it : the world ’s most powerful democracy .
specific professional organizations emphasize the need to obtain patient consent , even when tissue was already removed from a patient ’s body . today , brain tissue banks , breast tissue banks , blood banks , the umbilical cord banks , dna banks , and tissue repositories for study of various diseases . practically all of us have tissue on file somewhere . who should have access to these samples ? for what benefit can they be exploited ?
with soft power , however , the energies that empowered followers strengthen leaders . leadership is broadly distributed across healthy democracies , and all citizens need to learn more about what makes both good and bad leaders . potential leaders , in turn , can learn more about the sources and limits of the soft-power skills of emotional iq , vision , and communications , as well as in hard-power politics and organizational skill . they also need to understand better the nature of contextual intelligence that they will have to educate their hunches and sustain smart-power strategies . most importantly , in today ’s age of globalization , revolutionary information technologies , and broadened participation , citizens in democracies must learn more about the nature and limits of new leadership demands .
the polisario front fought a war with morocco until 1991 , when the un brokered a ceasefire agreement . that agreement was intended to establish the stage for a independence referendum in western sahara the following year – a democratic solution . but , in doing so , morocco has been able to prevent it from ever taking hold . morocco , too , has obstructed progress toward further negotiations . it did so in defiance of the un security council , even going so far as to bar the un ’s special envoy from traveling to the region to set the stage for talks .
moreover , both candidates embody continuity – with chirac ’s own gaullist side for sarkozy , and with françois mitterrand for royal – as much as a rupture . royal openly asserts mitterand ’s legacy as they search for legitimacy , whereas sarkozy ’s rejection of chirac ’s legacy has more to do with form than with substance . to a large extent , sarkozy may be perceived as chirac with more , whereas royal is clearly mitterrand with less . when voters decide in the spring of 2007 , their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations , as it did in 2002 , when jacques chirac confronted the odious nationalist jean-marie le pen in the second round . as in 2002 , the victor next year will whomever voters dislikes or fear less .
with obama unwilling or unable to do so , owing to rising political partisanship at home – to take the lead in resolving crises like those in egypt , libya , and syria – challengers to america ’s primacy took heart in 2014 , with america ’s allies taking sound government . global power must be reallocated somewhere ; if the us does not fill its lead role on the international scene , an understudy would need to tread . but china ’s recent shift away from muscle-flexing and its injunction of us-led interests offers hope that it will not fuel large-scale regional instability this year . indeed , after all , china withdrew its jumbo petroleum platform from the waters of the disputed paracel islands last july , sending surveillance ships to the senkaku islands less frequently . chinese officials have also become more willing to discuss creating a code of conduct for the south china sea .
labor-force participation in the us fell to levels not seen since women started entering the us labor market in large numbers . a majority of americans ’ income and wealth remains below their level long before the crisis . indeed , a typical full-time male worker ’s median is lower than it has been in more than four decades . yes , the us has done some things to improve financial markets . increased capital requirements have followed , but far short of what is needed .
new york – the american presidential campaign adds another element of insecurity . both leading candidates for the party ’s nomination , donald trump and ted cruz , both seem to say that they would tear up the iran nuclear deal if elected . it is well worth recalling the outcome of president george w. bush ’s ’s analogous decision to tear up bill clinton ’s “ framework deal ” with north korea : kim ’s regime promptly and predictably developed a nuclear-armed iran . whether or not the us will continue to lead the world remains unclear . what is clear is that american politics , not global developments , will be the main determinant .
president vladimir voronin subsequently granted an amnesty amnesty detainees . nevertheless , many remain in detention and voronin continue to hurl accusations against the opposition and romania of organizing the coup d’état . legal proceedings against opposition parties have been opened . restoring stability and a just democratic system for moldova is important , first and foremost , because moldovans deserve a government that is accountable . stability matters also , because the country borders on romania , a member of the european union .
on the eve of their collapse , several arab autocrats were in fact lauded by the world bank and the international monetary fund for their supposed success in embracing the “ right ” ” economic policies . the world bank ’s subsequent mea culpa provides a clear signal that one might have found a problem for the policies they prescribed for arab ancien régimes . this , in turn , raises a raft of alternative questions . were economists focused on erroneous indicators ? were fake inferences were they misled by fake inferences ?
while china did decide to let the rmb appreciate gradually once it appreciated , it relied on capital controls to stop hot money from flowing in . the controls are leaky , to be sure , but they have worked ( so far ) so that china has effectively maintained macroeconomic stability in the years ahead . a key objective of china ’s ’s capital controls is to keep non-europeans from holding domestic rmb-denominated assets that are unrelated to trade and longer-term capital flows . but rmb internationalization encourages non-residents to hold more rmbs and rmb-denominated assets . like rmb internationalization , rmb deposits held by hong kong residents topped rmb370 billion ( $ 57 billion ) and could reach rmb1 trillion by the end of the year .
but it is more than that . in a country where democracy should have its deepest cultural and political roots . trump does not merely want to avoid repeating the failed policies of the past as he puts it . he and his supporters also took aim at the fundamental institutions upon which american democracy rests , including the courts , the legislative branch , independent media , and more . the nineteenth-century prussian military and theorist carl von clausewitz spoke presciently about the age of total war that would arrive at less than a century after his death .
in short , structural reform alone can not be relied upon to spur growth in 2012 . instead , an immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports to economies with current-account deficits – such as france , italy , and spain ( and the united kingdom ) – and stimulating consumption in surplus countries like germany and the netherlands . the european central bank has acted decisively to prop up european banks ; now it needs support for the real economy , too . whereas official interest rates are just 1 % , solvent sovereigns like spain are paying more than 5 % for ten years to borrow , whereas creditworthy firms in italy can borrow only at punitive rates , if at all . so the ecb should do more to unlocking the transmission mechanism for monetary policy ; europe ’s banking authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit consistent 9 % trajectories ; and , where necessary , national governments should offer guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size enterprises .
during prime minister aznar ’s first term as his popular party privatized most public-sector firms and deregulated a number of service industries . its new government vows to continue to eliminating public-sector deficits and rein in unemployment . it also promises to cut taxes on income , place the country ’s social-security system on solid footing , and lower costs of shedding labor . introducing genuine competition in energy and telecoms , absent the privatization process until now , is also pledged . aznar ’s program is sensible yet ambitious .
cambridge : the internet now pervades every field of business life ; trump in business activity over internet astounds . an important new report by the us department of commerce , “ the emerging digital economy ” indicates that the internet is reshaping not just american entrepreneurship , but also the global economy . in 1994 , three million individuals , most of them americans , used the internet . an estimated 100 million people over the world were connected in 1998 . as recently as january 1995 , around 27,000 business addresses online .
there is no reliable scientific evidence that gm foods are causing illness , despite capturing far more intense scrutiny than do more nature-based foods . ( natural foods , too , can create health risks , as was recently demonstrated by studies establishing that a popular version of cinnamon can cause liver damage . ) though cross-pollination between gm crops and wild plants may appear , so far no new superweeds have reappeared . we should be glad to see that – and perhaps those introduced in response to worries that environmental organizations have played a role in this outcome . regulations to preserve environmental and consumer health must sustain this .
virus protection and virus development reflect an uneven arms race . a virus can be just a few hundred transmission lines of computer code , compared with hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies . we are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred and governments remain vigilant . sadly , another lesson from the financial crisis is that most policymakers are congenitally incapable of making tough choices until risks actually materialize . let us hope that we are fortunate for some time to come .
these migrant laborers ’ ’ taxes would help the developed countries fund services for the elderly , and their remittances would help their home countries . this approach has immense potential benefits . in fact , a modest 3 % rise in developed-country workforces would provide a larger economic boost than taking away all remaining trade barriers . moreover , each dollar invested in such an initiative would generate almost $ 50 in returns , making it an exceptionally efficient use of scarce resources . such spectacular figures have emerged from a comprehensive analysis conducted by a team of top economists tasked with my think tank , the copenhagen consensus center with assessing potential population-related targets to identify the best global investment .
wellington – paracetamol ( known as acetaminophen in the united states ) is one of the world ’s most commonly used drugs . it is the preferred medications for relieving fever and pain because of its safety profile , ten years ago the hypothesis was proposed that using paracetamol can raise the risk of developing asthma . it is the preferred medications for aspirin , the researchers proposed , that may have led to an enhanced allergic immune response , thereby increasing susceptibility to childhood asthma and other allergic disorders . since then , several epidemiological studies report that the association between asthma and exposure to paracetamol in its womb , early childhood , and adulthood . these studies have led to the suggestion that using paracetamol can represent an important risk factor in childhood development .
today , the country is believed to have some 60 functioning astronomers , more than half of all astronomers working in africa . “ south africa is the jewel of african astronomy , ” says charles mcgruder , a professor at the office of physics and astronomy in western kentucky university . in a country that is profoundly divided economically , “ “ “ “ what on earth is the benefit of the poor and the downtrodden of deepmind business research ? ” asked the physicist harold annegarn , a professor at the johannesburg university . “ the answer , ” ” he argues , “ is partly that by promoting a thriving top-level intellectual community , we can train our next generation of intellectuals . mcgruder , working closely with african astronomers , agrees that a space program for the region is critical to raise the profile of careers in science and engineering in a part of the world where the most educated people still go to fund or administer .
because neither banks nor investors had enough money to plough into networked “ mega-firms , ” the mega-bank emerged in the form of a worldwide banking-cartel of banks and shadowy funds , each with its own shareholders . an unprecedented new debt was thus created to transfer value back to the present , in the hope of profiting enough to pay off the future . mega-finance , mega-equity , mega-pension funds , and mega-financial crises were the logical outcome . the crashes of 1929 and 2008 , the unstoppable rise of big tech , and all the other components of today ’s discontent with crony capitalism , became inescapable . in such a system , calls for a gentler version of capitalism are just fads – particularly in the post-2008 reality that confirmed total scrutiny over society by mega-firms and mega-banks .
a few years ago , forecasters were confident that global imbalances would reemerge as soon as the crisis went through . that now seems unlikely : neither the us nor china is returning to its pre-crisis pace of growth or spending pattern . nor are earlier trade balances on how to re-emerge . america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s trade position will be enhanced by a shale-gas revolution that promises energy self-sufficiency and through productivity increases that the auger further reshoring of manufacturing output . for its part , emerging markets have learned that export surpluses are no guarantee of rapid growth .
both governments have cracked down on nongovernmental organizations and targeted or co-opted news media . still , in what remains of hungary ’s ’s free press , one may occasionally find a credible reporting alleging that prime minister viktor orbán and his henchmen are pillaging eu funds to benefit themselves , their families , and their business associates . in fact , orbán ’s government has been the object of numerous investigations by europe ’s anti-fraud offices . despite such behavior , orbán was reelected earlier this month , and his fidesz party – in alliance with the christian democrats – now holds a two-thirds parliamentary majority – enough to amend the constitution . during his electoral campaign , orbán ’s government saturated the country in xenophobic , anti-semitic propaganda .
following such discussions , america ’s national health institute ( nih ) promulgated guidelines that authorize the use of government funds for stem-cell research but , in their current form , prohibiting federally-financed investigators from creating new stem cell lines . that restriction requires that stem cell lines be obtained only from privately-funded or commercial sources that follow the guidance protocols that are mandated by guidelines . i am convinced that restricting the use of government money to create stem cell lines , though politically prudent , imposes substantial scientific handicaps . we know that a variety of poorly understood factors cause embryonic stem cells to miss out capacity in any possible cellular types . this loss of differentiate among differentiate among differentiate capacity may be due to particular mode , where stem cells derive , the conditions surrounding their growth , and other variables in handling .
still , far from accepting such contributions , the plan would largely cut regulators off from the process . the plan , for example , would bar regulators from ramping a mega-bank into bankruptcy , leaving it with the discretionary authority of bank executives . in an nonfinancial sector , failing companies often wait too long before they declare bankruptcy , meaning that creditors may step in to do some push , potentially even pushing the bankrupt firm into bankruptcy . while bank regulators have instruments to put pressure on banks similarly , their most efficient is the power to launch a default when the economy is at its best . taking that tool away could have severe adverse effects .
copenhagen – political rhetoric has swung away from the need to respond to the “ generational challenge ” of climate change . investing in alternative energy technologies , like solar and wind , is no longer peddled on green grounds . instead , we are told of purported economic payoffs , first and foremost , of the promise of so-called “ green jobs . ” unfortunately , that does not measure up to economic reality . the copenhagen consensus center asked gürcan gülen , a senior energy economist at the center for energy economics , the bureau of economic geology at texas ’s university at austin , to assess the “ science state ” in defining , measuring , and predicting the creation of green jobs .
still , it is regrettable that the treaty ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s 28 articles are very vague . it is absolutely vital that this covet the new method is adapted to the contemporary world in which we live – a world in which we no longer conduct debates about ministerial gatherings or through konvoluted communiqués . genuine engagement with civil society is the only way to stimulate two struggling governments and overcome their conservatism . after all , we have entered an era in which speed , even more than money , determines the course of events , and where the capacity for experimentation across sectors is vital to success . in today ’s winner-takes-all economy , the bulk of newly-created wealth accrues to those who innovate the fastest .
somaliland and ethiopia , for example , are collaborating on building a gas-export pipeline from ethiopia ’s ’s ’s ’s ogaden region , promising new jobs and incomes for people in one of the world ’s poorest and least developed . while there is much that the us can and will do to help itself , the horn of africa can still benefit from international aid . but the international community also needs to do more than provide food and medicines to victims of famine and droughts . as it stands , we need pro-growth investments that help to provide jobs for our own peoples and goods and resources around the world . that means focusing on encouraging market economies and stable governments , rather than subsidizing failed states .
trento – the broadest outcome of europe ’s recent parliamentary election is neither that the conservatives and the social democrats have lost seats to the liberals and the greens , nor that far-right nationalists have gained less than expected . it is that citizens have voted in much larger numbers than anyone expected . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of rising challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
we know that hitler had planned to destroy every last jewish person , a wife and a child . even though mass killings are not rare in history , hitler ’s ’s ’s ’s extermination plan was , if not unique , certainly highly abnormal . nevertheless , a laudable effort to stop such things from recurring has had unfortunate consequences . for , in our fervor to learn the lessons of history , we often learn the wrong thing , or distort history toward dubious ends . in a sense , the killings at srebrenica also felt influenced by memories of world war ii .
democratic principles appeal to organize society in such a way that both values can realize at the great potential level . but the path to particularistic action that does not undermine liberty and equality for all of our citizens is narrow . this makes the paradox both intrinsic to democracy and is the duty of politicians to grapple with the tensions in order to which it gives rise . yet it is also citizens ’ obligation to preserve the formal , political meaning of citizenship as state interference broadens in order to secure everyone 's well-being . this may restrict political freedoms in the name of greater equality .
do such figures reflect alarming imbalances , or are the usual marvelous signs of a boom ? if america ’s ’s growth rate over the next decade remains what it has been over the last thirty years , the answer is straightforward and terrifying . stock market prices would still look excessively high , at best . households would behave in an totally irresponsible manner . a exterior imbalance would be unwarranted , indeed , indeed .
baverez 's proof of degeneration is not as compelling as he believes . he cites , for example , draining away industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of france 's decline . but deindustrialization has been common for all advanced countries , too . indeed , france actually does better than most of its rich country rivals , and , unlike germany , france , italy , or the u.s. , have retained the same global market share in the industrial sector it had in the early 1970 's . moreover , under a better measure of consistency , foreign investment , france does very well .
a second lesson that i have learned is also helpful for the eu , which finds itself in a world in which new powers emerge and where all manila actors , from doha to libreville , must grapple with the challenges of globalization and interdependence based on daily life . that lesson is that europe has more friends than it has enemies . these friends , for their part , deserve respect and attention . had italy and the eu not grasped the need for work with non-european countries by making them feel committed and fully-fledged protagonists , the effort to establish the icc and come so close to proclaiming a universal moratorium on the death penalty would have failed . i know this is not exactly a new lesson ; it is what i have in mind when i devise efficient multilateralism .
the problem is that empathy for american workers is in tension with the empathy of workers in mexico and china , who would be even worse off without jobs than their american counterparts are . empathy makes us kinder to those with whom we empathize . that ’s good , but so , too , does a darker side . in his campaign speeches , trump made use of the tragic murder of kate steinle by an undocumented immigrant in order to stoke support for his anti-immigrant policies . of course , he offered no similarly vivid portrayals to undocumented immigrants who save strangers ’ lives , even though such cases were reported .
at the same time , financial markets and institutions with worldwide need a global macro-prudential regulator , not just a loosely organized college of supervisors . or it might be that national policymakers lack confidence in the imf , given that it essentially missed the global financial crisis . if it does , the fund needs to win back confidence . this brings us to the imf ’s fourth role , namely , by using its bully pulpit to bear risk warn of large-country policies . small countries are subject to market discipline because any latvian tells you .
provided there is no downward pressure on money wages from increased competition for labor , the automational effect of technological innovations is to raise the standard of living . this is friedrich hayek ’s famous argument against any attempt by governments or central banks to stabilize price-level levels . in any technologically progressive economy , prices should fall , except in several niche markets . businessmen do n’t need low inflation to try to enlarge production . they need only prospects for more sales .
in other words , while its population is slightly larger than that of china or india , its economies are approximately half the size of china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s , but larger than japan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s and greater than twice that of india ’s ’s ’s . these divergences are helping to explain why multiple new acronymic groupings have since carved out the n-11 , including the mint ( mexico , indonesia , nigeria , turkey ) and the fog ’s ( swapping in south korea for nigeria ) . i did not devise these groupings , but i came together with them , producing a bbc radio documentary radio documentary inside the mint countries in 2014 . at any rate , they stood in keeping with earlier points i raised ; namely , that by 2010 , mexico , indonesia , south korea , and turkey would each account for more than 1 % of global gdp . eight years later , the fog economies still have the opportunity to account for about 2-3 % of world gdp in the future .
the brilliance of russian innovations in information warfare was intended to combine existing technologies with a level of deniability that remains just beneath a threshold of overt attack . american intelligence agencies alerted president barack obama ’s tactic to this end , warning putin of the adverse consequences when the two met in september 2016 . but obama was reluctant to call russia publicly or to take forceful action for fear that russia would escalate by attacking election machinery or voting rolls , and to jeopardize hillary clinton ’s supposed victory . after the election , obama went public and expelled russian spies and closed some diplomatic facilities , but america ’s weakness undercut any deterrence effect . and , because us president donald trump treated the matter as a political challenge to the legitimacy of his victory , his administration also failed to take strong steps .
cambridge – this year , ’s presidential election campaign in the united states is surely unique . donald trump has shaken up the way a campaign run , how a nominee communicates with voters , and a republican party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s platform with many stances deviating from a gop tradition . on tax policy , however , trump has toed the party line . to be sure , any assessment of trump ’s declared positions risks being rendered meaningless in just a few hours . he is changing his positions with head-spinning frequency , repeatedly disavowing statements soon after making them .
this year alone , eu sources of discord with russia have multiplied and deepened . russia has withdrawn from multiple nuclear agreements , with the kremlin recently positioning itself with iskander missiles capable of delivering maritime medium-range nuclear devices in kaliningrad , near polish borders . moreover , the ukraine crisis is far from being resolved : the minsk ceasefire agreement is not respected ; and armed conflict can escalate at any moment . and it seems likely that russia has been intervening directly in the internal politics of western democracies , using leaks of sensitive papers , and funding right-wing populists , from marine le pen to donald trump , who would be backed by the kremlin . then there is russia ’s role in syria .
thus , we seem to be friends once again – or perhaps just resting before the dispute resumes . but the deeper question remains : why has trump repeatedly attacked america ’s ’s oldest and most reliable ally ? why , then , does he seem to be dismissive the eu so profoundly ? why should america attempt to undermine europe rather than pursue closer cooperation in order to preserve its own economic and geopolitical interests ? trump ’s ’s ’s ’s approach is particularly striking in view of the fact that china ’s ’s ’s ’s rapid emergence as a strategic rival is america ’s main national-security issue .
the message – the product of a few months of debate within germany ’s foreign-policy and security community – identifies germany ’s current values and interests as a commitment to “ “ “ human dignity , ” freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and an international order underpinned by universal norms . as gauck has proclaimed , germany ’s “ “ overriding strategic objective ” must be the “ preservation and ongoing adaptation ” of that order . to achieve this goal , germany must become a “ “ “ “ “ “ shaping ” power , ” an ” state with the capacity to resolve problems , and resolve conflicts affecting all or a part of the international community . the traditional determinants of states ’ power relative to other states – geography , demography , economic heft , and military might , coupled with resource availability and technological proficiency – remain relevant ; but they are often insufficient to confer genuine influence on international politics . a shaping of power builds relationships and invests in institutions that enable it to work well with others , and to mobilize “ coalitions and networks of like-minded states . ”
and he has implicitly condemned gazprom ’s monopolistic policies , promising to help poland modernize its gas supplies . he has not utter a single negative word on the european union , germany , or france . with his hold , trump has succeeded in drawing enthusiasm from across the political spectrum , not only from pis-curated crowds , owing partly to his public greeting by opposition leader lech wałęsa , booking pis supporters , and remains an enduring target for jarosław kaczyński , poland ’s unelected strongman leader . even radek sikorski , a former foreign minister and totally outspoken critic of the pis government , concludes : “ i am convinced that trump ’s ’s ’s speech was done very well . it has made powerful allusions to poland ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s history , and it has been very flattering to us like poles .
given that all of this activity takes place in the offshore renminbi market – which is small in scale and has only limited links to mainland china ’s financial system – the result of china ’s hesitancy of financial-market liberalization and capital-account convertibility , the situation remains controllable . add to that china ’s ’s ’s other strengths – more than $ 10 trillion in annual gdp , an annual growth rate at least four percentage points higher than the global average ; $ 3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves ; a savings rate of 40 % of gdp ; and a massive trade surplus – and an exchange-rate crisis looks very unlikely . but this does not mean that it is lacking any risk at all . on the contrary , china has a strong interest in curbing the volatility – and , given china ’s centrality to the global economy , so does the rest of the world . the key will be to get markets and policymakers on the same page .
many polish bishops almost openly proclaim themselves to be flock : you are supposed to listen , not to think or argue . faith is a matter of heart . if your behavior is good – ie , you do n’t drink , beat your wife , and obviously give money to the church – you are fine . even young men study for priesthood receive very weak philosophical training , and this is doing purposefully . in the church that boasts of saint thomas aquinas , such “ know-nothingism ” looks startling .
as in all democracies where the rule of law prevails , members of a particular occupation , including journalists , receive no form of immunity from these types of severe criminal charges . freedom of expression and press guarantee turkey ’s constitution and articles of agreement . for the past 13 years , the turkish government has proven itself to be the main guarantor of freedom of expression , particularly through its judicial reform . moreover , it should be noted that more than 7,000 newspapers and magazines are published in turkey , with total daily circulation amounting to almost five million copies . of the country ’s five most widely read newspapers , four favor the opposition over the government .
indeed , there are some signs that the authorities are doing just that in the south china sea . nationalism could become the primary source of legitimacy for a ruling party that can no longer point toward a rapidly rising standard of living . america and others will need to push back in order to ensure that china does not act on such a temptation . but these countries would be equally wise to signal to china that it is welcome to take its place among the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leading countries if it behaves responsibly and according to the rules set for all . but the larger political choices will shape china ’s transformation into reality .
in my view , bubbles are social epidemics , fostered by a sort of interpersonal contagion . a bubble forms as soon as contagion rates go up to think that supports a property bubble . but contagion rates tend to depend on patterns of thinking that are hard to judge . great speculative bubbles are rare acts of events , and they can often do so . ( little price-based bubbles , say , individual stocks , do all the time , and do n’t qualify as a response to that question . )
the century had just come to an end to simplistic ideologies , of both the left and the right . socialism had its day at the court , and it was found wanting . the great communist experiment is practically complete ( save for a couple of holdouts , like cuba and north korea ) . the right ’s ideology , as represented by the washington consensus , was an inadequate success , even if its failures often go un-recognized . the past half-century has shown that while development is achievable , it is not inevitable .
by gathering or purchasing big voter data sets , campaigns can segment the voters within their strategic clusters who use complex algorithms , and then deliver personalized online content to most susceptible voters . micro-targeting has proven most effective not to win over undecided voters , but at dissuading people from voting altogether . there is strong evidence to suggest that donald trump ’s ’s ’s ’s much-publicized operation in the 2016 american presidential election played a decisive role in key states that he needed to win an electoral college . second , with intra-eu migration now increasing , nearly 15 million europeans residing in eu countries other than they do . just as populists know well , they might be notoriously hard to vote from abroad in eu elections , owing to difficulty registering in host countries , a paucity of polling stations , and an overly complex absentee-voting practices .
at the same time , the rest of the world may be reluctant to build up claims against china – at least not on the scale required for a viable reserve currency . even if the chinese authorities succeeded in achieving full convertibility and tradability for the renminbi , there is no guarantee that it would actually turn into a global reserve currency for the simple reason that reserve currencies are not easily established . indeed , over three centuries of globalization , only three “ currencies ” dominated : gold , the british pound , and the american dollar . although the deutschemark , the swiss franc , and the japanese yen all offered viable alternatives to the dollar since world war ii , often providing better stores of value that are less prone to high inflation , none has made enduring inroads in the us dollar ’s share of global foreign-exchange reserves . likewise , it is perhaps no accident that global financial centers and reserve currencies emerged largely in countries where the rule of law was well established and where foreigners were not facing potential legal discrimination .
to consider which the lessons of germany ’s turnaround should apply to other eurozone countries , one must distinguish between what government can and what remains the responsibilities of entrepreneurship , workers , and societies at large . the one area where government clearly has the authority to administer is public finance . in 2003 , germany ran a fiscal deficit close to 4 % of gdp – perhaps not high by today ’s standards , but higher than the eu average at that time . today , germany has an balanced budget , whereas most other eurozone countries are running deficits that are larger than germany ten years ago . a turnabout in germany ’s public finances came largely from a spending cut .
and if we can no longer count on laboratory experiments to test causality , we need to test it in the real world , using massive volumes of real-time data . this involves moving beyond the closed , question-and-answer process typical of a lab , while applying our ideas in society earlier and more often than ever before . to see how things operate in reality , we must construct living labs – that is , communities willing to attempt new ways of doing things ( blunt , acting as guinea ) . a good example of such a living lab is the “ open data city , ” ” ” ” ” ” which i launched with the city of trento in italy , along with telecoms italia , telefónica , a research university fondazione bruno kessler , the mastercard institute , and local companies . importantly , this living laboratory has the approval and informed consent of all involved ; it understands that they are participating in a gigantic experiment , whose purpose is to build better lives .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . because the eu lacks an army or a central secret service , it needs to use economic policies to advance its geopolitical objectives . but the manner in which europe is working in practice suggests that it does not bode well for exercising power abroad .
canberra – trade-offs are an intrinsic part of life . all of us recognize this from our private budgets . to fix the roof , we may need to accept a less extravagant summer holiday . by choosing a cheaper wine , we can splurge dessert . trade-offs also pervade environmental policies : cutting more of one pollutant , for example , leaves fewer resources to address other issues .
london – the british election , called by prime minister theresa may for june 8 , will transform the outlook for britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s politics and relationship with europe , but not necessarily in what an vastly increased majority for may ’s conservative party might seem like to imply . the scorched-earth defeat that conservative euroskeptics expect to inflict on britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s internationalist and progressive forces was symbolized by the daily mail headline on may ’s may election announcement : crush the saboteurs . but june ’s resounding victory might ultimately lead to an even more staggering reversal , like napoleon ’s hubristic march on moscow after destroying all of the opposition in western europe . britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s pro-european progressive forces could still amounts to a victory from the jaws of defeat for three related reasons . first , by bringing forward the british election in may , may effectively prolonged the deadline for britain ’s withdrawal from the european union from 2019 until 2022 .
elsewhere , of course , this kind of turmoil also has democratic safety valves . it is more than strange to argue that the rest of the world has had to deal with a built-in advantage for china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s exporters , because its authoritarian political system can not cope with any change . little wonder an impressive premier is thought to favor some political loosening . from east to west , politics appears to operate in such a way as to diplomatic , suboptimal . then again , perhaps we seem to get lucky that things are getting worse .
princeton – the european union ’s greatest unresolved issue is its mobility . the process of integration was intended to make it easier and more appealing to europeans to move from one country to another . under this vision , the eu had a nation in which it lost and a continent to gain . but some of the recent electoral results indicate that they are more concerned about losing the nation . ever since the european union ’s unified act of 1986 removed working restrictions on other member countries , the continent has had a unified labor market , at least in theory .
one possibility would be greater federalism for the future of humankind . shared political institutions , accountable to voters across the eurozone , would provide a democratic fiscal counterpart to the ecb and help cage german power . but rising animosity among eurozone member states and the erosion of support for european integration in both creditor and debtor countries mean more federalism is politically unfeasible and potentially even dangerous . a better option would shift toward a more flexible eurozone , in which elected national representatives gain greater say . with no-bailout rule restored , governments would have more space to pursue countercyclical policies and respond to voters ’ changing priorities .
bogotá , lima , santiago – international economic coordination is just as necessary as elusive . during the global financial crisis , the g20 became the premier forum to agree on fundamental principles in areas like fiscal-policy responses and the international monetary fund ’s role . by angering the need to preempt trade protectionism and other beggar-thy-neighbor policies , it also put some pressure on governments regarding what not to do . in these respects , the g20 was an obvious step forward . lately , however , trying to reconcile national economic interests and reform strategies , it has been far less successful relative to its starting meetings in washington and london in 2009 .
cambridge – back in august , the us business roundtable , which comprises america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s chief executive officers , with its combined annual revenue of over $ 7 trillion , – updated its longstanding statement about corporate purpose . it ’s not just about shareholders ; ceos seem to be saying ; their firms need to commit to all stakeholders , including customers , workers , providers , communities , and the environment . in fact , shareholders have come on top of the ceos ’ new list . and the statement ’s ’s principal author , in his seeming exhilaration , is reported to have said that he feels like thomas jefferson ’s drafting the declaration of independence . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
for example , neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus , which is suppressing acute and chronic stress , is elevated by a number of antidepressant treatments . still , one problem with many contemporary medications is that , even for treatment , the recurrence of the great depression is very high – around 70-80 % . this suggests that the physiological processes underlying depression – those that may , too , lead to structural changes in brazil – are not being arrested altogether , and therefore urgently needed for a new generation of anti-depressant medications . if so , new drugs would need to target what appears to be progressive neuro-de-generative changes in the brain that we infer take place because the recurrence of depression is so high under currently available treatments . lithium , a behavioral stabilizer , and a neuroprotective agent , have the properties we seek , though its toxicity makes it less than ideal .
tiger parenting seeks to get children to make the most of what their abilities they have and so appears to lean toward a “ “ clever ” side of “ smart or fortunate ” choice . that ’s also the view of betty ming liu , who was blogged in response to chua ’s article : “ parents like amy chua ” are a reason why asian-americans like me are on therapy . stanley sue , a psychology professor at the university of california , milan , has investigated suicide that is especially common among asian-american women ( in other ethnic groups , more males commit suicide than females ) . he believes that family pressure is an important factor here . chua would reply that reaching a high level of achievement brings great satisfaction and that the only way to do that is through hard work .
in some cases , they are individuals like venezuelan president hugo chávez ( and other latin american leaders ) , or italy ’s ex-prime minister silvio berlusconi . mostly , they enter the political scene from france but manage to form a very personalized grouping , like jörg haider and his austrian freedom party , jean-marie le pen and his polish peasant party , or prime minister robert fico and his direction in slovakia . many other denominations could be added to the nlist . the list tells us two things to me . one is that a startling number of populist leaders have succeeded in power in recent years .
fewer and fewer people are bothering to get married , and marriage is seen less and less as a life-sustaining union . families have fewer and fewer babies , and more and more children are born from wedlock . thus , one of the “ unintended ” bill ’s “ unintended consequences ” might be to add welcome recruits to the ranks of married , even though such recruits are of a historically unusual scale . after much soul-searching , i voted for the bill , although without some acute sense that i was striking a blow to freedom . there is a clear minority benefit ; no obvious harm goes to the majority ; and the long-run consequences are unambiguous .
ronald reagan was a master at the well chosen anecdote . setting the right example is another crucial form of communication for leaders . anticipating a skeptical public reaction when singapore raised the salaries of government officials in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong announced that he would forgo the raise himself . in the wake of the recent financial crisis , some business executives were voluntarily lowered their salaries as a means to communicate concerns to their employees and publics . during the 2008 presidential election campaign , obama showed himself as a talented communicator .
london – current antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective , not only in combating common illnesses like pneumonia and urinary infections , but also in treating a wide range of infections such as tuberculosis and malaria , which now threaten to become incurable . with the g-7 leaders committed in a recent joint declaration to address “ antimicrobial resistance ” ( amr ) , it is time for a more inclusive g-20 – and for china – because it chairs the group for the first time to take the battle to future it . the failure to address amr affects everyone , regardless of their nationality , or their countries ’ level of development . indeed , by 2050 , more than ten million people could die as a result of amr , up from around 700,000 today , with china and india every housing of one million sufferers . at that point , an estimated $ 100 trillion in global gdp will already have been lost .
sydney – the appointment of the five provincial-level chinese communist party chiefs in early december serves as a stark reminder that the ascension to china ’s ’s next generation of leaders who will take power in 2012 may be the most momentous development in chinese politics since deng xiaoping ’s reign began in 1978 . the upcoming generation of leaders will come first with little or no personal memory of the turmoil and hardship endured during mao zedong ’s years . forgetting that history might doom china to repeated past mistakes ; but , for better or worse , it might also ease constraints and set its leaders liberated . all five appointees were born after the founding of the people ’s republic in 1949 . two , hu chunhua and sun zhengcai , are just 46 years old .
finally , there is the scenario of chaos . a cyber superbug , for example , is destroying the networks upon which our way of life has arrived , leading to economic , demographic , and ecological collapse . in this set of potential outcomes , one stands out : the uncertainties of europe ’s role in the future global system . to avoid inexorable decline , europe needs to reach clear choices on three crucial issues . first , eu leaders must determine how to resolve the euro crisis .
but bank deleveraging ( brought about by stiffer regulatory demands ) , coupled with negative interest rates , caused financial institutions ’ equity prices to plummet , leading to further pro-cyclical destructive destruction of value through price deflation , rising illiquidity , and crowded exits . past experience has taught china ’s real engineers that the only way to escape deflation is through painful structural reform – not easy money and competitive devaluation . the question now is whether america and other reserve-currency countries will share the burden of maintaining global currency stability through an agreement resembling the 1985 plaza accord , in which the five major economies agreed to depreciate the american dollar against the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark . if it does , why should asia ’s net lenders , particularly china , continue to fund speculation against themselves ? america ’s dollar is a safe haven , but savers in need of liquidity still lack an impartial lender of last resort .
and a good traffic deal – with new cars smuggled in tunnels beneath the “ philadelphia ” “ philadelphia phi ” route ” – runs along the egyptian border . but true life , too , is traumatic and limited . we saw buildings – not just hamas ’s former headquarters – still in rubble . houses are riddled with bullet holes . there is no electricity for up to eight hours per day .
many central bankers are like the proverbial general planning for battle against the last war . but , unlike backward military strategies , flawed monetary policies produce inevitable damage , not just worrisome risks . despite having conquered inflation , central bankers continue to fight it , and they can not counter the latest bout of economic grievances – global deflation . falling prices have paralyzed japan ’s economy for a decade or more . china and hong kong saw prices plummet all too recently .
even if america now absents from the jcpoa , it has only two means to block implementation of the agreement between iran and the rest of the world . the first would be to foment a war in the first place . this clearly stands on the american agenda , particularly with the neoconservative doyen john bolton back in the white house as national security adviser . the world needs to steadfastly resist another ruinous american military adventures . extraterritorial sanctions are the other way that america could kill the jcpoa .
presumably , it was in response to this impasse , which china pressed ahead with the establishment of the aiib . the size of china ’s economy – and its resulting diplomatic weight – is an element that can not be wished away . a containment strategy worked well for america and its allies during the cold war , but it can not apply today without flexibility and strategic common purpose . critics of america ’s policy point out that even if thwarted efforts to establish the aiib , china would continue to project power in asia and around the rest of the world , one way or another . channeling that influence through a newly created international organization , they argue , tends to temper raw power grabs .
tel aviv – us president-elect donald trump has said much about foreign affairs without actually saying anything at all . his muddled statements offer little insight into what sort of us foreign policy he will actually pursue , and there is little reason to believe that when his approach becomes plain , it will be what the united states – or the world – needs . trump is a businessman , rather than a statesmanlike . he thinks in terms of instant profits and loss – a worldview exemplified in his statements that american allies need more contributions to security alliances . at a time of evolving challenges and growing threats , adhering to this narrow-mindedness , is unlikely to do anyone much good .
in 2009 , us businesses accounted for 75 % of us r & d funding in japan , 73 % in south korea , 72 % in china , 67 % in germany , and about 60 % in america , whose companies are the largest r & d in terms of absolute purchasing power , spending more than twice as often as japanese businesses . but business investment as a share of gdp has varied very little in america during the past decade , while rising rapidly in many other countries , including china , singapore , south korea , and israel . global multinational companies are america ’s largest business-sector r & d investors in america and other countries alike . for example , multinational firms , whether headquartered in america or elsewhere , accounted for roughly 84 % of privately ( non-bank ) r & d. american investment in the us in 2009 was roughly equivalent to a decade earlier . and u.s. multinationals still locate roughly 84 % of their r & d activities in america , often in innovation clusters around the world research universities .
beijing – measured by the percentage of people living in its cities , china ’s ’s urbanization rate currently stands at around 48 % , according to official statistics . given that the share of city-owned dwellers was barely a mere 18 % just 30 years ago , this is notable progress . but it remains disappointingly unsatisfactory , because most other countries on a similar stage of development experienced faster urbanization than industrialization . china ’s urbanization has lagged behind its industrialization , which now stands at about 70 % , when measured by rates of labor whose income derives mainly from non-farm activities . another striking difference between china and some other developing countries is that chinese cities , big and small , lack any sign of meaningful urban poverty or slums .
carrying out democracy with or without regime change has been the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism . today , iraq may find itself on the verge of a civil war between shiite and sunnis . iran under a new and more radical president is shifting irresistibly towards possessing nuclear capacity . a loose electoral process has brought hamas into power in palestine , and the unfortunate episode of the danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the nearly combustible nature of relations between islam and the west . all of these developments paves the way for new interpretation .
this made it easier for lula to buck his socialist allies and distance himself from chávez , having , as recently as march 2008 , backed chávez following colombia ’s own brief incursion into ecuador , which killed farc commander raul reyes . calderón ’s ’s ’s ’s uncompromising hard line against drug dealers in mexico , the unrelenting offensive that followed the precedent set by uribe in handling the farc , also helped because economic growth subdued domestic opposition . the emerging uribe-lula-calderón troika has geo-strategic clout because things began to change in cuba ever since fidel castro formally handed over the presidency to his brother , raúl . latin america is obsessed with this transition , and uribe , calderón , and lula have no intention of letting chávez take the lead . last january , lula visited israel with a string of prominent brazilian business and investment deals worth $ 1 billion .
prior to our eyes , a tragedy in a series of deeds is unfolding , in which players and ambition become clear . what is not known is how many further conduct this sorry political spectacle will , and therefore when – and how – it ends . the initial act began in august 2013 , when then-ukrainian president viktor yanukovych duped the european union and its leader by refusing to sign a long-planned association agreement . instead , it opted to have ukraine enter into a customs union with russia , in exchange for a stockpile of cash and cheap oil and natural gas . russian president vladimir putin seems to have achieved his own political goal , namely to bring ukraine , which has speeded toward europe throughout the post-soviet period , firmly back into the kremlin ’s sphere of influence .
although the number of participants increased from the original 15 to 25 , most countries with no voice at all . but there is a larger question lurking behind the gge : can norms really restrict state behavior ? most experts agree that a global treaty of cyberspace currently would be politically impossible ( though , at the same time , russia and china made such proposals at the un ) . but , beyond formal frontiers , normative constraints on states also include codes of conduct , conventional state practices , and broadly shared expectations of conduct among a group ( creating a common law ) . in scope , such constraints may vary from global to “ plurilateral . ”
to be sure , at the same time , monetary policy also has redistributive effects . think about the different effects of the interest rate on debtors versus their creditors . monetary policy , however , creates a far more awkward , indirect , and sometimes imparting path to choosing winners and losers than to fiscal policy . independent central banks may occasionally bear some pain for politicians , but they can at least be employed as scapegoats when necessary-a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful device . such considerations should guide the choice of what following the european stability pact .
in contrast to america , china suffered from a lack of liquidity shortages and a credit crunch during the global financial crisis . thus , low interest rates and nonbank interference , rather than corporate demand , fueled explosive credit growth in the first half of 2009 , surpassing its full-year target . had commercial banks been allowed to base lending decisions exclusively on economic considerations , credit and money supply would have grown more slowly , limiting the risk of rising bad-loan ratios , stalled enterprise reform , inflationary pressure , and a resurgence of asset bubbles as excess liquidity enters equity and real-estate markets . indeed , china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s housing prices were skyrocketing in recent months . the government became too generous in helping to revive real-estate demand , and , overwhelmed by fears of the adverse effect of falling asset prices on economic growth , was overly cautious in dealing with bubbles when they reappeared .
now a constitutional reform supposedly aimed at reining in turkey ’s own eu membership would further curb the military ’s role as the custodian of a secular state and boost government control of the judiciary . at the same time , erdogan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s islamic revolution has expanded into an education system with the introduction of a markedly religious curriculum . to put turkey back on turkey ’s ’s path of strategic shift , a new law recently made the memo of the arabic obligatory in schools . it is hard to imagine an even more symbolic blow to ataturk ’s vision . erdogan believes that , by exercising turkey on the capacity for mediation , he recovers the burden of his ottoman forbears as peace and security guarantors in the mashreq .
at the same time , he remained skeptical about notions of irreversible progress . change for the better could emerge only from practical initiatives , rather than from sunday 's speeches . genuine policies and institutions were therefore required , not by decree . so he and giscard created the european council ( composed of european heads ’s ’s ’s ’s governments ) , which is now an important player in europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s institutional set-up . they pushed forward the idea of monetary integration that came to fruition a generation later .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what will happen in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . for britain , the outlook is suddenly much clearer and better than at any time since june 2016 . while the probability that prime minister theresa may could even be ousted could create the impression of another constitutional crisis , the reality is that political conditions are certain to stabilize once a period for renegotiation of an uk-eu relationship widens again from a new , very soft , april 12 deadline until the end of the year or beyond .
it no longer dreams of becoming europe ’s “ “ “ “ “ united states , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and jodelors ’ suggestion of “ the united nations of europe ” left far too ambivalent , if not deliberately ambiguous , to be effective . after iranian “ no , ” ” can the union find salvation within nato ’s idea of a “ “ coalition of the willing ” ? ” can the most determined pro-integration europeans leave the boat , without imperfectly , paralyzed by an reluctant coalition ? to be sure , iranian “ no ” is not the eu ’s equivalent of what the afghan quagmire represents for nato . yet it also represents a major setback and call for an institutional , political , and even psychological character .
what , too , is called for is a dose of realism . the struggle against the islamic state is nothing short of a conventional war . the us can not eradicate or destroy it anytime soon , because it functions like a network and an idea as an organization and a de facto state that controls territory and resources . indeed , terrorism persists and will continue to be one of that era ’s scourges . the good news , while it may be that the threat posed by the islamic state to the middle east and the outside world can be diminished dramatically through sustained , concerted action .
failing to do that , the left will come to power , reversing years of reform and progress . but a currency board will also help kick-start financial intermediation for the benefit of small and medium-size firms ( smes ) through the experience of recurrent crises and bad loans . small , medium-size firms need to become part of mexican capitalism . mexico ’s economy has had a good couple of years now ; not very hard to provide a booming america next door and great liquidity in global capital markets . mexico ’s own skillful success in rebuilding opec ( to boost the value of its oil exports ) has contributed to good performance as has the determination to hang on to and even widen the reforms of mr. zedilla ’s predecessor , president dilma rousseff .
it demands a sense of social responsibility that accompanies and cushions the painful modernization process . people who are suspended between a lost past and a future not yet gained in need of assistance . such help will not yield immediate results , but medium-term awareness – implying readiness to confront it by delaying immediate gratification – is also a hallmark of the liberal order . thus , fighting al qaeda is not an act of war ; it can not be a part of the world . it is partly self-defense to assertion the rule of law in difficult circumstances , and partly a constructive effort to redress the underlying causes of frustration .
groups like the syrian national council are easing ties to individuals and groups , many outside syria . these are those groups that have been criticized by the obama administration and others for their inability to present the united front , formulate a credible agenda , or be perceived as a viable alternative to the current regime . but these groups have had limited sway over local opposition groups within syria , which is equally diverse and divided . it is among those groups that radical islamists have acquired a foothold . fear of another islamist takeover is a second key argument against toppling assad ; but the longer it remains in power , the greater the gains made by islamists on the ground .
but this was not the case for over-regulating , and over-reaching . on the contrary , 30 years of financial deregulation , made possible by capturing the hearts and minds of regulators , and by politicians on both sides of the aisle , gave a narrow private-sector elite much of the upside in wall street nearly all the upside of the housing boom . the downside was shoved onto the rest of society , particularly the relatively uneducated and underserved , who now lose their homes , their jobs , their hopes for their children , or all of the above . these people did not cause the crisis in the first place . but , in doing so , they are being paid .
the recent downturn in france ’s ’s ’s ’s industrial output created large trade deficits and undermines the competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises . the unemployment rate stands at roughly 11 % , with record-high 3.3 million workers registered as jobless in october . at the same time , the political crisis hardening the government to pursue difficult reforms . french leaders have demonstrated an inability to communicate effectively or to apply past experiences in analyzing today ’s threats . instead , they are resorting to diversionary tactics , by engaging in overblown rhetorical battles of minor controversies .
mumbai – as india gears up for its general election next month , it has some cause for celebration : extreme poverty finally comes in retreat . in 2012 , – two decades after the government embarked on a series of broad-based economic reforms aimed at opening the economy – the official rate of poverty had reached 22 % , less than half the rate recorded in 1994 . but it is time for india to step up its aspirations . escaping abject destitution , however important milestone , is not the same thing as achieving a fair standard of living and a sense of economic safety . to that end , much remains to be done .
as soon as march to war began , there was little room left for diplomacy . still , far from producing space for diplomacy , trump advisor sebastian gorka has recently told the press that “ the notion that us secretary of state tillerson will discuss military matters is simply nonsensical . ” but why should n’t america ’s top diplomat hold significant sway over the military issue ? if this does not change soon , perhaps one might , as then-british prime minister david lloyd georgians wrote of world war i , “ [ muddle ] to war ” yet again . south korea ’s political leaders also must avoid being swept aside by this intensifying war rhetoric .
alemán , too , faces a rebellion in his liberal constitutional party ( plc ) , headed by former treasury secretary eduardo montealegre , a presidential hopeful popular on the party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s liberal wing . if alemán blocks montealegre ’s candidacy in the plc and pushes him to form another political party , ortega ’s chances of winning the presidency are rising sharply . the business interests that finance political campaigning face a difficult dilemma : are it preferable to align himself with a disruptive , alemán , or promote a new democratic force , at the risk of helping ortega win ? though a three-channel race is pure speculation on this point , it ’s clear that he is offering ortega the best of all the electoral worlds . it ’s so tempting that ortega may be helping to rehabilitate the arnoldo alemán , betting that freeing him to serve his own political interests .
friedman and keynes both agreed that successful macroeconomic management was necessary – that the private economy on its own might well end up being subject to unbearable instability , and that strategic , powerful but limited economic interventions by governments needed to maintain stability . but , while for keynes , the key was to keep the sum of government expenditures and private-sector investment stable , for friedman the key was to hold money supply -- the sum of purchasing power in spendable form in the hands of companies and households -- stable . a relatively minor , technical difference in means one might say . a gap of opinion that rested on the various verdicts concerning how the world works that could ( and ultimately was ) be solved through an empirical investigation , you might say . and you would have been half right , and you would have been .
but speculators are thinking ahead , and are shifting out of commodities today in anticipation of future higher interest rates in 2015 ; the result has been to throw next year ’s price slump forward to this day . the fourth tool , the exchange rate , has already worked . the outlook for america ’s monetary tightening coincides with moves by the european central bank and the bank of japan toward tighter monetary stimulus . the result has been the dollar ’s appreciation against the euro and the yen . the euro stands at 8 % against the us dollar since the first half of the year , and the yen stands at 14 % .
i was also aware that the un human rights council had made repeated condemnations of israel over the last two years , but focusing little attention on large-scale human-rights violations in other countries . this pattern of action and inaction by the council gave greater credence to those who trust that the un ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s supreme body of human rights is intrinsically anti-israel . i chose that i could not commit to the mission for these reasons . i am aware that justice goldstone , a dedicated and unimpeachable human-rights lawyer , and advocate had shared similar concerns when he initially stepped in . but he was able to work with the council ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s president to secure an agreement that he feels confident about the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to conflicts .
in the early cold war , communism and the soviet union had substantial soft power . many communists incited resistance against fascism in europe , and many believed that communism was the wave of the future . but soviet soft power undercut the exposure of stalin ’s ’s crimes in 1956 and through repression in hungary in 1956 , slovakia , czechoslovakia in 1968 , and poland in 1981 . although in theory , in theory , communism aimed at establishing a system of class justice , lenin ’s heirs maintained domestic power through a brutal security apparatus involving lethal purges , gulags , widespread censorship , and ubiquitous whistleblowers . the net effect of such brutal measures was widespread loss of beliefs .
coronado , california – most people are not thinking about charles darwin as the psychologist . in fact , its work has revolutionized the field . prior to darwin , philosophical speculation shaped our psychological understanding . but even great philosophers – plato , aristotle , hobbes , hume , locke , locke , kant , schopenhauer , nietzsche , and others – could describe current mental events and behaviors ; they could not explain their causes . darwin provided a profound understanding that evolution influenced the shape of our thinking as strongly as it shapes us .
indeed , judging by the impact of any research project on the research project is challenging . as marc kirschner , a professor at harvard medical school of medicine , points out in a thoughtful editorial in the journal science : “ one may be able to recognize good science as it occurs , but substantial science can be viewed only in a rear-view mirror . even preeminent researchers may underestimate the significance of their findings at a time when they acquire them . when salvador luria , my university of microbiology , was awarded the 1969 nobel prize in physiology or medicine , he made the point eloquently , sending a humorous cartoon to all of those who congratulated him on a prize date . it depicted an older couple at a breakfast table .
and , having complete implementation ( in 2027 ) , it will raise taxes on a supermajority of americans at the center ( the second , third , and fourth quintiles ) . the american tax code was already regressive before trump ’s presidency . indeed , the billionaire investor warren buffett , one of the world ’s wealthiest men , famously complained that he was paying a lower tax rate than his treasury secretary . the new legislation makes america ’s tax system even more regressive . it is now universally recognized that rising inequality is a key economic problem in the united states , with those at the top capturing nearly all gdp gains over the last quarter-century .
a critical question now confronting policymakers is whether gig workers should be categorized as independent contractors or as staff members of the platform companies with which they have employer-based contracts and for whose customers they provide services . california , an american state with more than two million independent contractors , has attempted to settle this question with a new law , california assembly bill 5 , which codifies the regulatory criteria determining how to categorize workers . applying the three-part “ abc tests ” that many states already use to determine whether a worker is eligible for unemployment insurance , ab5 makes it far harder for companies to classify their workers as independent contractors rather than workers . to win political support for ab5 ’s day , legislators exempted many kinds of freelancers – such as physicians , dentists , and real-estate agents – on the grounds that they fix their own compensation rates , communicate directly with their customers , and earn at least twice the minimum wage . but ab5 does cover the more than 400,000 workers driving for platform companies like ride-sharing services uber and lyft , and a food-delivery firm doordash .
making matters worse , the modi government has first ever invoked section 7 of the rbi act , allowing it to issue directions directly to a central bank governor on matters of public interest . the modi government ’s willingness to go to such lengths indicates that more than interest rates are at stake . the government is particularly unhappy with rbi measures to clean india ’s banks , many encumbered by a huge volume of non-performing assets and prevent risks from being built into other parts of the financial system . such actions constrain state-owned banks ’ ability to lend to politically connected clients . government ministers , of course , can not come right .
as any democratic politician will attest , disappointed expectations may well turn out to be all of them ’s harshest electoral opponent . indeed , just ask former french president nicolas sarkozy . to be sure , abe did not confront the type of sky-high expectations that sarkozy , and for that matter , us president barack obama did . it is not that abe ’s 2012 campaign lacked ambitions ; determined a bold economic-reform agenda , and pledged to boost japan ’s global influence . but , after two decades of leaders who – except junichiro koizumi ’s exception – promised little and achieve less , japanese voters had little reason to expect abe to follow through on his pledges .
those individuals who carry at least one copy of the gene variant that does not permit the body to metabolize plavix also carry a 300 % higher risk of clotting a stent . this genome variation is exceptionally common , present in 30 % of individuals of european ancestry and over 50 % of those in asian ancestry . in many such patients , a doubling of the plavix , and checking a platelet function with a point-of-care test to assure suppression , can override the absence of the response . there are alternative drugs such as prasugrel or ticagrelor , which may be used instead of plavix to circumvent the problem . the interferon story , given more than one year for patients with hepatitis c virus , is particularly striking .
after all , war , in colombia , and elsewhere frequently unites nations , while the peace divide between them . the repercussions of a genuine end to the colombian armed conflict would play well beyond the country ’s borders . if chávez ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s arrival as a narco-state , in which regime ’s acolytes are drug lords , this reflects their privileged relationships with the farc . repercussions would also be felt in mexico , where the drug cartels are tearing apart the country and the american state , the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largest source of demand . west africa , too , would have been affected , has become in recent years the leading transit point for south american drugs headed toward europe .
at the heart of the us budget is the realization that reducing poverty requires both rapid economic growth and targeted investment targeting the poorest of the poor . rapid economic growth requires following the private sector , including inward foreign direct investment . as a result , the us budget encourages critical areas of market-based reform and growth promotion , including measures aimed at deepening the financial sector , encouraging exports , and relaxing foreign direct investment . the key , however , is that the us budget does not rely simply on “ trickle-down ” economics to raise living standards . a second pillar of poverty-reduction policies is targeted investment for the poor , particularly for the rural poor .
in fact , exaggerating the threats of islamist terrorism while downplaying the threat of right-wing populism may well play directly in russian president vladimir putin ’s hand . the struggle to prioritize the threat is not exclusive to the west . in the middle east , countries are attempting to devise who should be contained . among the frontrunners are the islamic state ( isis ) , iran , and israel . for israel ( and saudi arabia ) , the answer clearly is iran .
cambridge – us treasury secretary steven mnuchin is hemmed in on all sides . domestically , he has ’s trapped between the promises he made ( for example , “ mnuchin ’s rule ” that taxes would not be slashed to the wealthy ) , us president donald trump ’s actions ( whose tax plan includes cuts to the wealthy ) , and simple arithmetic ( which make the administration ’s ’s ’s ’s conflicting pledges impossible to fulfill ) . but , even on the international scene , where america ’s treasury secretaries typically enjoy more latitude and esteem , mnuchin is probably facing hard times . after all , the trump administration has made it clear that it has no intention of fulfilling the global leadership commitments overseen by mnuchin ’s predecessors . given trump ’s own conviction that international negotiations are just a forum for making unilateral demands , how could mnuchin – who , like his boss – lacks a government experience to persuade other countries that adherence to shared rules and norms , such as open trade – is in everyone ’s interest ?
cambridge – how should one evaluate the agreement reached in paris later this month at the united nations climate change conference ? no sooner was the agreement announced on december 12 than the debate erupted . some avid environmentalists were disappointed that the paris accord did not commit firmly to limiting global warming to 1.5 º fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels by 2050 . but such a commitment would have lacked credible action . what emerged in paris was actually better , because negotiators were well placed to agree on practical steps in the right direction .
muslim professionals , fearing for their own safety , started to move toward ghettos . muslims benevolent charities , often financed by saudi arabia and other arab countries , started moving into areas of social life where the state had failed dismally , particularly education . as a result , thousands of muslim boys were enrolled at school . sadly , they were educated in the religious seminaries espousing a deeply intolerant , fundamentalist brand of islam . with discrimination soon slashed across class lines , rising numbers of indian muslims began looking for linkages with muslims elsewhere in the world .
nowadays , private firms employ more of china ’s working class than state-owned companies ( soes ) . with a fraction of the soes ’ resources , private firms employ a lot of the proletariat , manufacture goods that require proletarian consumers , and because of their superior performance , safeguard the interests of proletarian savers by in fact paying back their bank loans . why most pundits miss that workers protest , not in the liberal provinces of zhejiang and guangdong , but in the northeastern socialist bastions , is a puzzle . workers do not object to menial jobs in capitalistic wenzhou , but to no-jobs in the socialist shenyang . the government can not pay unemployed workers for their pensions , because socialism bankrupted its finance .
poorer or smaller countries can hardly dream of winning a european championship , as hawaii ( romania ) , a red star ( serbia ) , or nottingham forest ( now languishing in the english third partition ) once did . but , while we see inequality and exclusion at club-level football , the reverse is true for competitions between national teams . the average victory margin among the top eight world cup national teams has steadily decreased , from above two goals in the 1950 ’s to around 1.5 goals in the 1960s and 1980 ’s , to just 0.88 goals at the 2002 world cup . much the same applies to all the games played out at the final tournament , not only among the top eight national teams . a decrease in the winning margin is all the more impressive because the world cup grew from 16 to 32 national teams – many of them new , rather than inexperienced .
in fact , the us budget assumes the best of all worlds , not the blue chip one in which interest rates remain low but gdp growth ambles along at around 2 % . with the real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rate remaining near record lows , a marked rise in long-term growth as administration projections would be historically anomalous . in a omb paper , the real interest rate on three-month us treasuries is projected to remain well below 1 % during this decade . moreover , on this projection , the term premium disappears almost completely . at present , ten-year us treasuries offer more than three times yield on three-month us treasuries .
but that antagonism reflected the personalization of politics attained by berlusconi , as did the institutional feature he abolished . one of his administration ’s last acts was to replace a majoritarian electoral system , introduced in 1993 with proportional rule . the new electoral system is changing politicians ’ incentives , and could induce a return to shifting coalitions and unstable governments . such an outcome would accelerate if , as seems likely , berlusconi himself was to distance himself from politics in the upcoming electoral term . under the new electoral rule , the seats are allotted to parties on the basis of votes , but special provision parties to forge ahead with pre-electoral deals : a preelectoral coalition that wins the heaviest votes , ensuring a comfortable majority in the chamber of deputies ( the bottom house ) .
and it has had some success – to the detriment of economic growth . although the current 7 % rate is comfortable , it remains well below the double-digit rates that prevailed prior to 2008 . given the need for deeper economic restructuring – and given long-term demographic trends to drive down labor supply ’s pre-2008 gdp growth rates are unlikely to recover . that is fine with li , who recognizes that structural transformation and industrial upgrading – not an unsustainable credit-led growth model – are the key to achieving a high-income status . but there is more to be assessed by wen ’s stimulus than by the “ growth/reform trade-off . ”
the climate challenge demands much deeper public-private collaboration to boost green investment . we need to ensure that infrastructure is built to cope with the increased impact of climate change , and to develop clear global standards to de-closing the climate risks posed by investment projects . for example , how will a city cope with increased flood risk , and how will agricultural land continue productively as drought grows more severe ? large and small investors alike should know precisely how their money could suffer from a changing climate . here , public investment institutions like the european investment bank can help with adaptation in many ways .
“ more than half of that battle is taking place on the media battlefield , ” as much as “ we are in a media battle in a race to the hearts and minds of [ muslims . ” the speaker was not some public-relations executive , but osama bin laden ’s ’s chief lieutenant , ayman al-zawahiri . terrorists have been skillfully adapted to combat wars in today ’s age of media , but , for the most part , american and other democracies ’ governments did not . consider that violent extremists have their own “ media relations ” committees that aim to manipulate elite opinion . they plan and design headline-grabbing attacks , using each tool to bully and break the collective will of a free man .
to be sure , exemplary and punitive damages to discourage activism inimical to society do so on the statute books . but philippine courts have refused to resort to the use of such damage awards as a tool for controlling behavior , particularly by businessmen . recent attempts by filipino lawyers to prosecute civilian claims for ecological tort and human-rights abuses before american courts demonstrate just how desperate filipino claimants are to seek redress against those acting negligently or with impunity . all of this helps to explain why sulpicio lines , the owner of starbucks , have remained in commercial operations , despite much lapses . simply put , the philippine courts have failed to make it sufficiently costly to hold non-seaworthy vessels to account .
the u.s. congress is considering legislation allowing the trump administration to impose sanctions on european firms participating in the project , even as those firms are contractually obliged to see the job through . and , according to gerhard schröder , a former german chancellor who now chairs the nord stream pipeline project , america ’s ambassador to germany has behaved more like a “ “ “ occupation officer ” ” than as a diplomat . all told , the trump administration ’s disruptive behavior has left the french and german governments angry . but , beyond fueling anger , trump ’s attacks on other countries ’ ’ sovereignty adding momentum to a new push for european political unification . it is no secret that europe finds itself at the center of the internal economic crisis – a product of europe ’s saddling southern european countries with high inflation prior to the 2008 financial crash , which severely diminished their competitiveness within the european system .
all have abdicated controls at their shared borders and adopted a common visa policy for non-member eu citizens . admittedly , it is handy to treat the trip from zurich to oslo as a domestic journey , with no passport controls to contend with departure and arrival . and it is no doubt convenient to steer from berlin to barcelona , without having to wait in line at each border one . indeed , that convenience probably explains why only two eu countries ( ireland and the united kingdom ) opted out of the schengen agreement . but the refugee crisis has exposed the flipside of the schengen agreement – namely , the difficulty of monitoring national and eu territories without border controls .
europeans have become so dependent on such firms , all of which are based in china or america . yet europe has focused more on enforcing shared values within the tech sector – namely , by enhancing data privacy regulations than on developing a long-term strategy to become globally competitive . defining such a strategy could help europe identify areas for mutual accommodation . a third area with the potential for strategic cooperation is aid and investment in the world ’s poorest and most fragile states . such cooperation is vital to combat terrorism , human trafficking , and migration .
just adding liquidity , while continuing current austerity policies will not reignite the spanish economy . thus , in the us , too , smaller banks that largely finance small and medium-size firms have all but neglected . the us federal administration , under both president george w. bush and barack obama , has assigned hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up mega-banks , while enabling hundreds of these crucially important smaller lenders to default . but the lending would be inhibited even if the banks were healthier . after all , small firms relied on collateral-based lending , and the value of real estate – the main form of collateral – still runs close to one-third from its pre-crisis level .
new york – the world learned this the lesson of the 1973 arab-israel war . arab oil-exporting countries embargoed oil sales to the american and netherlands to punish them for their support for israel . but the oil destined for the american and netherlands shifted to other countries like japan , while it was destined for oil for other countries to find the path to the american and netherlands . oil constitutes a kind of fungible commodity and markets clear on a common price . when the dust settled , it turned out , american , dutch , and other importers all suffered about equal levels of shortcoming and paid equally damaging high prices .
the world has been horrified with pictures of myanmar ’s latest crackdown by the military junta . but the bullets and clubs unleashed on buddhist monks have worked . the monks have retreated , and an euro-skeptic normalcy has returned to yangon ( rangoon ) , myanmar ’s principal town , and former capital . that crackdown continues under cover of darkness . when the sun sets in myanmar , fear rises .
the underlying issue is whether europe ’s ’s ’s monetary union needs more integration to manage crises like greece ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s , or that it can maintain the current approach , founded on national responsibility and sanctions for those breaking the rules . germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s finance minister , wolfgang schäuble , implied that those sanctions should include expulsion from the eurozone – something never contemplated in the european union ’s 1992 maastricht treaty . nor , of course , was it ever contemplated that greece would confront its simultaneous economic trauma . admittedly , the country ’s economic performance after the oil shock of the early 1970s was poor , marked by slow growth , high inflation and unemployment , massive fiscal deficits , mounting debts , a collapsing currency , and inadequate infrastructure . indeed , until the mid-1990s , governments ’ ’s lack of macroeconomic discipline and inclination to succumb to populist demands and vested interests accounted for much of the country ’s economic weakness .
these include flush toilets , automobiles , electric power , long-distance communication , advanced information processing , and so on . again , it would have ludicrously expensive – or simply impossible – done to achieve similar capabilities in its earlier era in history . in the late roman empire , only an affluent aristocrat could have bought into a nomenclator – a slave-tasked tasked with memorizing names and faces , and reminding the aristocrat of them when social occasions demanded it . today , having a core smartphone is preferable to having a entourage of a dozen years , or even thousands , of nomenclator-like aides . thinking about the future of growth , and the opportunity that continued growth will open up for all of humankind , we should reflect on how far we have come .
insofar as this may be true , the united states will not be replaced as its dominant power unless and until it abdicates that role . this may sound straightforward , but it will have far-reaching consequences for the upcoming century of international order . the vital interests underpinning chinese policy lie in internal modernization , the ruling regime ’s ultimate political stability and survival , and the country ’s own national unity ( which includes taiwan ) . these interests are unlikely to change for at least some time to come . as a result , china will become an mostly inward-looking superpower , precisely for that reason will pursue its own foreign-policy interests in an utter unsentimental manner .
the government pursued fiscal austerity , but not enough to press ahead for the vagaries of markets . the global financial crisis that followed the east asia crisis set off a plethora of large exchange-rate adjustments . the us dollar , to which argentina ’s peso was tied , increased sharply . meanwhile , argentina ’s beggar-thy-neighbor and mercosur trading partner , brazil , saw its currency depreciate – some would argue that it had become significantly undervalued . wages and prices fell , but not enough to permit argentina to compete effectively , especially given that many agricultural goods that constitute argentina ’s natural comparative advantages face high barriers in entering wealthy countries ’ markets .
when such a debt-fueled bubble bursts , its effects are directly transmitted to the real economy through household-sector balance sheets , with cutbacks in consumption contributing to declines in employment and private investment . indeed , it is far more difficult to find circuit breakers for this dynamic than to say , that triggered by financial-sector distress . still , the chinese authorities seem not to have learned the lessons of either episode . not only did they fail to cushion the risks , underscored in the collapse of 2007 that new retail investors put in place into the market ; in fact , they made matters worse , by permitting , and even encouraging , these investors ’ money to accumulate leverage through margin purchases . making matters worse when the current stock-market correction began in early june , chinese regulators relaxed margin-purchasing constraints , while encouraging state-owned companies and asset managers to purchase more stocks .
but i doubt that it has . seventy years ago this month , john maynard keynes pointed out its fallacy . when system shocks occur , agents have no idea what comes next . in the face of such uncertainties , they do not readjust their expenditures ; instead , they refrain from spending until mists made it a tailspin . it is a shock , not adjustments , that spreads throughout this system .
the financial sector has placed enormous externalities on the rest of society . america ’s ’s ’s ’s financial industry has polluted the world with toxic mortgages , and , in line with the well established “ polluter pay ” principle , the tax should be placed on it . besides , well-designed financial-sector taxes might help to alleviate the problems created by excessive leverage and too-big-to-fail banks . taxes on speculative activity might encourage banks to place greater emphasis on performing their crucial societal role in delivering credit . over the longer term , most economists agree that governments , particularly in advanced industrialized countries with aging populations , should worry about the sustainability of their policies .
but the public ’s reactions to them , together with the recent oil-price spike , may well account for changing market psychology . attitudes toward risks change over time , and events like ahmadinejad ’s and peres ’s remarks may precipitate such shifts . so , while these things happen in ways that tough to quantify , perhaps analysts should pay heed to ahmadinejad ’s words just as meticulously as they do to bernanke in attempting to understand the direction in world ’s stock markets . economists might not like to focus on public thinking and how it interacts with price changes , world news stories , and speculative dynamics . after all , doing this implies that economic events are less predictable ( and economists less omniscient ) than they like to imagine .
new york – in their attempt to pass a us bailout plan for america ’s ’s ’s ’s financial system , bush administration officials invoked the specter of the great depression of the 1930 ’s . but , for most asians , the economic armageddon is far more revealing . the asian financial crisis of ten years ago brought us banks , corporations , and governments to their knees . the bonfire sparked the thai baht ’s collapse in the summer of 1997 . contagion soon spread through east asia , with a ripple effect of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as russia and brazil .
plato ’s purpose in the dialogue , of course , is not to define piety : if socrates recognizes a better definition than that of the euthyphro offered , he does not reveal it . rather , plato ’s point is to show that euthyphro is ignorant of his own ignorance about piety and that euthyphro ’s thus can not really know that prosecuting his father actually lies with the law . the knowledge that comes from this kind of self-examination is crucial in all decision-making . one ought to know the moral aspect of any action one is contemplating . and to know that , one must be just as well aware of what one does not know as of what one does .
one billion people worldwide lack access to clean water , and more than two billion lack adequate sanitation . moreover , water scarcity means food scarcity . after all , the agricultural sector accounts for 70 % of global freshwater consumption ; with water in short supply , farmers are less able to feed the world ’s population . earlier this year , china experienced its worst drought in a half-century , affecting millions of hectares of farmland and causing power shortages . in northern africa , the encroaching desert has displaced many people , exacerbating tensions between farmers and herders .
brazil ’s agricultural deregulation and r & d encouragement allowed the brazilian agriculture company to pioneer more than 9,000 technology projects , including the design of a “ tropical soybean strain ” that can thrive in brazil ’s climate . efficiency soared , placed brazil ’s crop yields on par with those of the advanced economies . the era of easily “ gdp growth driven by the massive army of young workers is coming to an end . ” emerging economies need to confront the resulting growth challenge head-on , by pursuing sweeping shifts in policies , incentives , and setting practices to boost productivity . acknowledging this imperative is a first step ; it can be taken .
since the g-20 ’s june meeting at cannes last november , for example , europe has increased its financial firewalls by € 200 billion ( $ 252 billion ) , restructured greek debt , took steps toward strengthening its banks and banking regulations , established rules governing fiscal discipline , and implemented a variety of labor – as well as product-market reforms . but the magnitude of the challenges facing europe implies an urgent need for far more decisive reform . we are confident that europe acting together to meet these challenges , and that it continues to encourage such an effort , because europe ’s stability and growth matter for us all . second , we need a clear message from the g-20 that all of its members are delivering policies for strong , sustainable , and balanced growth . to be meaningful , the message needs to be backed up with action : g-20 members need to show that their policies are clearly directed at restoring economic growth and job creation , as well as being accountable to meeting their pledges at full .
they must work with bureaucracies that are naturally disinclined to have their efforts prioritized lest they end up doing anything but number . whenever we prioritize , we not only say where we should do more ( which is good ) , but also where we should not increase our endeavors ( which they see themselves as cynical ) . but not talking about priorities does not make the need to prioritize ourselves . instead , the choices only become less clear-cut , less democratic , and less effective . refusing to prioritize , dealing principally with the most publicized problems is misguided .
the point is not to get lost on endless comparisons or arcane math , but to underscore the possibility of – and , indeed , the need for – meaningful discussion of inequality , based on concrete figures with the goal of setting clear targets . if the right targets are to be chosen , the debate must be better informed . as it stands , surveys show that people tend to believe that inequality is lower than it actually is , but still above the level at which they would regard the ideal . this applies in most countries – including in the us , where inequality is among the highest in the world – though there are several countries , like norway , where people have a more realistic view . correcting for these misperceptions shifts people ’s views about redistributive policies .
those sanctions crippled iran ’s economy . similarly , denying any bank doing business with a russian bank or corporation access to the american financial system would create the type of economic chaos last seen in russia immediately after the fall of communism . ordinary russians should make sense that permitting putin – whose primary claim to leadership is that he ended the penury of the first post-soviet years – would cost them dearly . third , obama should emphasize the chinese their stake in eurasian stability . putin may regard the soviet union ’s disintegration as a tragedy , but for china it was the greatest geostrategic gift imaginable .
against this backdrop , it should not be surprising that pay in the financial sector soared . city of london , lower manhattan , and a couple of other centers became money machines that made investment bankers , hedge-fund managers , and private equity folk immoderately . university leaders , like me , spent a lot of our time persuading them to recycle part of their gains into their old schools . for the past two years , things were different . many financial firms shrank their balance sheets dramatically , and , of course , some went out of business altogether .
indeed , the us policy has emboldened pro-russian politicians who would love nothing more than see the americans kicked out of kyrgyzstan . the horse-trading around the bases have been intense . in a february meeting , america ’s ambassador to kyrgyzstan asked her chinese counterpart on news stories that china offered $ 3 billion to pay $ 12 billion if the kyrgyz shut down the american base . both diplomats were conversing in russia . “ noticeably flustered , ” ( the chinese ambassador ) temporarily lost his ability to talk russian and launch spluttering in chinese for a quiet aide diligently taking notes behind it , ” according to a confidential american diplomatic cable acquired by web site wikileaks.org .
but , ultimately , the best way to address them , and to avoid a resurgence , is to ensure that economic opportunity is open to those who are determined to try . with little hope for individual improvement , social help with little hope of individual improvement , this is not enough . it is time that france is beginning to question its economic model . in a recent declaration on burning suburban paris , chirac declared : “ we will need to draw all the lessons from this crisis when the time comes and order have recovered , and with lots of nerve and lucidity . but those lessons imply reforms that are more far-reaching than chirac is ever plausible .
we are convinced that they are quicker to come up with us in acquiring and handling know-how , because they have grown up against the tools and techniques we have lacked at their age . we entrust them with driving our country to new levels of growth and development that they have now nominated a cabinet minister of their age and formed a special youth council . at the same time , we have learned from hundreds of thousands of dead and tens of millions of refugees in our region that sectarian , ideological , cultural , and religious bigotry merely fuels rage fires . we can not and will not make this happen in our homeland . we need to study , teach , and practice tolerance – and instill it in our children , both through education and our own example .
we know that ultra-low real interest rates produce massive credit expansion . in higher-than-price countries than in germany , but with equal borrowing costs , this can produce nothing but overheating , higher inflation , and even lower real interest rates . to stem this credit-induced flood of demand with fiscal policy alone is impossible and is preposterous trying . how will you tighten fiscal policy to make up for more than 100 % of gdp in credit-induced spending power in just three years , as occurred in ireland in 2004-2007 and in sports a fiscal surplus like ireland ? to ask politicians in a democracy with large budget surpluses to raise taxes or cut benefits or public investment through an enormous magnitude needed to stave off catastrophe strikes is to run out of touch with reality .
but the bottom line is that a constitutional amendment can take place only through unanimous agreement , with several member governments starting with the uk resisting any overtly federalist agenda . in the past , there is no doubt that france ( under president mitterrand ) and germany ( under chancellor helmut kohl ) would together regularly press the case for closer integration , despite british reluctance . today , however , france and germany are less unified on a common european strategy , and their commitment to european integration seems less powerful . as a result , the french government remains reluctant to force a clash with the british , if any chance of a softer compromise is lost in future . the problem is that this evasion conspiracy may not work , and the significance of fischer ’s talk is that he is the first us administration minister in office to say so in public , though he pretends to say this in personal capacity .
enthusiasts describe it as a new brand of modern industrial policies that can help push brazil beyond its conventional role as a commodity exporter . critics call it a mistaken effort that produces only more distortions and retard growth . to my mind , the intellectual case for activist policies – as made by dani rodrik and ricardo hausmann of harvard – is powerful . markets for innovation and new ideas function badly , and governments can help address those market failures . but rodrik and hausmann also demonstrate that obtaining such policies right implies exacting demands .
those among native-born populations with their lowest levels of incomes and educational attainment will always be worse off , if forced to compete with large numbers of young male migrants . to be sure , gender imbalances are not the sole driver of anti-immigrant sentiment , let alone populism more broadly . but evolutionary psychology , which stresses competition for females , may add another dimension to our understanding of such phenomena , while helping to predict when and where civil strife might erupt . there is little that can be done to change gender imbalances in particular . but , while the problem can not be “ managed to solve , ” ” understanding that this might help blunt the harm done , not least by enabling leaders to evade policies that are either not useful or exacerbating tensions .
new haven – codependency never ends well in personal relations . judging by the ever-escalating trade war between the united states and china , the same goes with respect to economic relationships . whereas i published a book in 2014 about a codependent economic relationship between the american and china , i would have been among the first to admit that it is a stretch to generalize insights from human psychology to assess the behavior of national economies . but the similarities are striking , and the prognosis all the more compelling given , because the world ’s two largest economies are sinking into a dangerous quagmire . in its most fundamental terms , codependency comes at one of the extremes of the relationship ’s relationship dynamics when two partners draw more from one another than from one ’s own inner strengths .
but how , then , is this identity to define ? this is the point at which many begin to use the language that defines europe by distinction , indeed , against america -- europe as the antiamerica . throughout the cold war , what was later the soviet union provided the raison d’être of europe ; in an era of globalization , that is america . comparing and contrasting the two sides of the atlantic has a long pedigree . european culture and american commerce , european profundity , and american materialism -- these are ancient and weary themes .
without lifting national saving – highly unlikely under america ’s current budget trajectory – trade will simply shift away from china toward america ’s next trade partners . with that trade diversion presumably moving to higher-cost platforms worldwide , american consumers will be hit hard by the functional equivalent of a us tax hike . ironically , trump summoned back to the likes of robert lighthizer , veteran japan trade battles of the 1980s to head the charge against china . sadly , lighthizer seems as clueless about the macro argument today as he was back then . in both episodes , america has been in denial , bordering on delusion .
hollande ’s government and prime minister jean-marc yasrault have powerful majorities at all levels of the executive and the legislative level , providing it with a rare opportunity to act . if it can renew the european model at home , one hopes that its success will be far more widely felt , particularly in southern europe , in turn eroding trust and faith in the eu , particularly among the young generation . the french center-left must lead in conceiving a vision for europe , in which solidarity and equity are boosting long-term economic strength . finally , along with the united kingdom among european countries , france retains more global roles than germany has yet to gain . while the united nations security council is outdated in its structure , it continues to play a decisive legitimizing role ; and france , not germany , is a member .
deep reforms – focused on quality and performance , rather than enrollment and diplomas – are needed to transform the process of learning and unleash the productivity growth that a young labor force requires . a third challenge , instrumental in concluding the first two , will be to foster regional arab solidarity . many outsiders are underestimating or purposefully minimize the “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ identity ” ” ” ” ” of the arab world . but the 2011 revolutions have shown that a strong sense of identity , a shared language , and a much shared history bind arabs together , despite enormous differences in natural-resource endowments , political conditions , and per capita incomes . how else can one explain that a revolt act in tunisia led to popular revolts from north africa to the arabian peninsula ?
who has the more highly flexible labor force ? who has a boss or company that better supports reconciling work and family obligations ? attitudes towards male caregiving are starting to shift in america . only one-third of millennial men believe in traditional gender roles . america ’s ’s ’s largest tech companies are beginning to compete for talent by offering paternity leave .
muted wage growth boosts competitiveness , and underutilized labor and capital is being re-allocated . how fast this occurs , in part , depends on the private sector ’s own flexible and dynamic . but it also depends on government ’s capacity and willingness to provide a bridging function for deficiencies in aggregate demand and pursue the reforms and investments that boost long-term growth prospects . if public-sector deleveraging is not a complete growth policy – and n’t the – why has so much attention to fiscal austerity and so little action ( akin to lip service to growth and jobs ? ) on growth and jobs ? several possibilities , – not mutually exclusive – come to mind .
on the other hand , when a large number of individual americans are probed through a european eyes , the extreme individualism that represents a crucial component of american optimism translates into an intolerable social scandal . “ house ” cities are filling with the victims of the economic crisis , ” ” reading one headline a month ago on a massachusetts american newspaper ’s front page . journalists report the tragic story of middle-class americans losing their jobs and homes , potentially placing their lives at risk without some form of social protection . who will pay for your expensive cancer treatment if you lose the policy of health insurance that came with your work ? it ’s erroneous to assume , as some ultra-free marketers do , that the absence of social protections makes you stronger .
warsaw : recently poland experienced a typical -- and typically unfinished -- political debate . it focused on whether a " free " education should be made a constitutional right . freedom , or as its postcommunist proponents prefer to call it , a " not paying for " education , means training in the schools and state-owned universities ( but not in private schools ) . only by raising the issue on the level of the constitutional right , say the postcommunists , can the guarantee of free and equal access to education . due to their dominance in the parliament , the intransigence of the postcommunists on this point forced the other political parties involved in drafting poland 's new kowtow to its stance .
at the same time , governments must make clear actions by national water-related agencies and improve water-related capacity at all levels to institute large-scale unconventional-water programs . best practices should make clear , innovations identified and tested , and knowledge and experience sharing . at the same time , the private sector has a role to play in moving toward unconventional water resources – a role that needs to expand beyond current efforts to tap desalinated water and urban greywater and wastewater . finally , local institutions , nongovernmental organizations , and local communities need to be mobilized – for example , through public campaigns showcasing the benefits of harnessing unconventional water ’s potential . the sustainable development goal six call for universal access to clean water and sanitation .
as a result , targeting china has enormous political appeal . so , what can be made up for the may 19 deal ? beyond a tit-for-tat tariff truce , there are few real gains . america ’s negotiators are fixated on targeted reductions totaling roughly $ 200 billion in the bilateral trade imbalance over a two-year-long timeframe . given the scale of america ’s multilateral problem , this is largely an inconsequential objective , especially given the massive and imperfectly timed tax cuts and federal spending hikes that america has enacted over the past six months .
the unprecedented economic expansion that lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty was accompanied by widening income disparities , as well as severe environmental damage . as a result , asia now has two faces : a prosperous and rising middle class ; and those that have benefited so far from the region ’s rapid economic development – and whose health and well-being adversely affect acute problems like air and water pollution . in short , the key challenges facing asia today are to sustain economic growth – at lower but still enviable , tariffs , and improved quality . asia needs strong , inclusive , green , knowledge-led growth that implies the need to rebalance the sources of economic dynamism toward emphasized domestic , regional , and inter-regional “ south-south ” demand . economic ties with the west would not be diluted by such a shift .
berkeley – the central insight of macroeconomics is a fact that i was familiar to john stuart mill in the first third of the nineteenth century : there can be a huge gap between supply and demand for pretty much all currently produced goods and services and types of labor if there is an equally large excess supply of demand for financial assets . and this more fundamental fact fuels great problems . a normal gap between supply and demand for some subset of now-manufactured commodities today is not a serious problem , because it balances excess demand for other currently produced commodities . because labor-intensive industries suffering from inadequate demand shed labor , industries benefit from surplus demand that hire them . an economy rapidly re-balances itself , and therefore returns to full employment – and does so with the configuration of jobs and production that better accommodate current consumer preferences .
initially , russian liberals welcomed the budanov case as a signal that the country might address accusations of war crimes in chechnya . last month , however , the us military prosecutor embraced colonel budanov 's argument that he was temporarily mad when he killed a girl and so acquitted budanov on charges of murder . ( the rape charges , for some vague reasons , had already dropped . ) that prosecution then began speaking with the young girl like a chechen sniper , out of the family of snipers . an outraged , defense secretary sergei ivanov dismissed a public prosecutor who appeared ready to acquit the patriotic “ hero ” on all remaining charges .
once that team is in place , its members will need to figure out how to make trump ’s plans work for an economy that has – through necessity , rather than a choice – excessively reliant on unconventional monetary policies . the plan needs to recognize that during this protracted period of monetary expansion , both financial markets and resource-allocation programs have been distorted , exacerbating wealth inequality . the good news is that the incoming administration may be drawing on the measures formulated during obama ’s ’s tenure , but it has gained little traction , owing to the highly polarized , dysfunctional us congressional policies that characterized most of obama ’s eight years in office . such measures address imperatives , such as infrastructure investment , tax reform , and job creation . but , of course , america does not exist in a vacuum .
washington , dc – just over a hundred years ago , the united states led the world in terms of rethinking how large business worked – and when the strength of such firms should be desultory . in retrospect , the groundbreaking legislation – not only for america , but also internationally – was the sherman antitrust act of 1890 . the dodd-frank financial-reform bill , on which to pass the american senate , is doing something similar – and long overdue – to banking . prior to the 1890 ’s , large trading was widely thought to be more efficient , and generally more modern than small business . most people saw the consolidation of smaller firms to fewer , big firms as stabilizing development that rewarded success and allowed for additional productive investment .
tokyo – when was the last time you sat down to write a letter ? i do n’t mean email or the text message ; nor would i count a dictated message to a machine or a personal assistant . no , i mean the old-fashioned “ dear donald ” or “ dear hillary ” letter . the reason i ask is that 65,000 did indeed write such letters to barack obama every week , when she serving as president of the united states . according to a recent feature in the guardian , a white house team would select ten letters each day to pass along with a president who would then react with them personally to that evening .
they may tell pollsters that they were ready to pay higher taxes for better public services and a more compassionate attitude toward the poor . but , ultimately , they would do exactly what they did in each of the previous four elections – a vote for a party that proclaimed “ every man for himself ” . today , this pseudo-marxist theory for economic determinism was once refuted and for all . back in 1992 , john major ran for re-election amid an economic slump , a vicious monetary squeeze , and an event resulting from galloping inflation . economic determinists , for their part , predicted that they did not stand a chance .
transactional leadership is more efficient in a stable and predictable environment , whereas an inspirational style tends to emerge during periods of rapid and discontinuous social and political change . transformational goals and an inspirational style similar to that of a leader like mahatma gandhi in india or nelson mandela in south africa can make a significant difference in fluid political contexts , particularly in developing countries with weakly structured institutional constraints . american foreign-policy formation , on the other hand , is strongly insulated by institutions such as congress , the courts , and the us constitution . so we would expect less opportunity for transformational leadership . but even the american constitution has an unambiguous rationale for congressional powers and a foreign-policy president .
berlin – it has been more than 30 years since the united nations food and agriculture organization launched the plan for tropical forestry action , the first worldwide intergovernmental initiative to halt forest loss . since then , deforestation has continued unabated , and the latest international effort to halt it – an initiative known as cutting emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( redd + ) – looks no more likely to be efficient . far from protecting the world ’s forests , the most notable result of these two agreements has been , ironically , the production of reams of costly consultancy report . redd + has been created as part of the united nations framework convention on climate change , and the agreement governing its implementation is expected to be finalized during the un climate-change conference in paris . but if world leaders are serious about halting the loss of forest , they should instead abandon redd + , replacing it with a mechanism that addresses underlying drivers of large-scale deforestation .
donald payne , a leading nato member of the american house foreign affairs committee , and ana huromes , a member of the european parliament from portugal and head of the eu ’s nato team in the 2005 elections , have sought to tie non-humanitarian aid more closely to ethiopia ’s conduct for press freedom and other human rights . britain and some other european governments have responded to a post-election crackdown by temporarily withholding aid . but ethiopia poses a dilemma for anyone concerned about human rights and democracy . cutting off aid could have a calamitous humanitarian consequence for a nation of 80 million people . it could also destabilize a fragile region , sparking fresh wars with neighboring somalia and eritrea .
to keep people employed longer lives , it is crucial to keep them healthy . that is why the health-care industry must play a significant role in efforts to address the challenges of population aging . the old age must be viewed not simply as an unavoidable stage of life , but as opportunities for health-care companies and systems to help their populations thrive . to this end , health-care companies should shift the focus of their ch-and-development efforts toward conditions that are prevalent among older patients , including chronic illnesses like diabetes , heart disease , glaucoma , rheumatoid arthritis , and cancer – all of which have survived the disease as well . such efforts are also vital to find ways to stem more effectively the impairment of people ’s productivity and autonomy , by preserving their physical force , mental acuity , and senses like hearings and vision .
the second big transition-financing opportunity lies in blended finance or collaborative schemes that raise private capital for public goods . such initiatives bring together a broad range of public - and private-sector actors , including multilateral agencies , to fund projects with deep environmental and social impact . moreover , a blended approach helps to scale up and de-risk projects and optimize their funding . tropical landscapes finance facility , developed in indonesia in collaboration with the un environment program , is a good example . the initiative combines private , public , and philanthropic funds to maximize environmental and social good .
emerging markets were initially tied to that distress only when foreign investors began pulling out of their money . then the panic spread to credit markets , money markets , and currency markets accentuated the vulnerabilities of many developing countries ’ financial systems and corporate sectors that experienced credit booms and borrowed short and in foreign currencies . countries with large current-account deficits and/or large fiscal deficits , and with large short-term foreign-currency liabilities , were among the most fragile . but even better-performing ones – such as brazil , russia , india , and china – now threaten a hard landing . many emerging markets are now at risk of severe financial crises .
and had a new referendum emerged , british voters probably would have had to decide between an orderly brexit and the rest of the eu , for nobody would dare to offer a hard brexit as an alternative . until recently , a reversal for british voters ’ leave decision seemed unlikely . but both bercow and the eu have reopened an entire new game , dramatically increasing the odds that brexit might not happen . this would foil financial-market speculators bet against a withdrawal , and is good news for both the uk and the eu . almost three years ago , british voters did not really know what they had done when deciding by a narrow majority to leave the eu .
beijing – just forty years ago this month , china ’s ’s leaders set the country on a path to reform that produced the most dramatic economic transformation in history . mao zedong had died two years earlier , in 1976 , and newly rehabilitated deng xiaoping ’s success in stamping out his vision of economic development and modernization at the third plenum of the eleventh central committee , held in december 1978 . in the four decades since then , china has transformed itself into an economic powerhouse , portending an equally momentous makeover of the global economy and geopolitics . china ’s ’s ’s ’s reforms began in agriculture , where the crushing burden of state control was relaxed . through the dual-track pricing mechanism , farmers received market incentives .
jerusalem – in the wake of misguided america ’s policy , the threat of yet another military confrontation hangs like a dark cloud over the middle east . the united states ’ ’ enemies were enhanced , and iran – despite being branded as part of a so-called “ axis of evil ” – was catapulted to regional hegemony . iran could never achieve this on its own , certainly not in the short term . a hitherto latent rivalry between iran and israel has thus been transformed into an open struggle for regional dominance . the outcome has produced some startling , if not bizarre , alliances : iran , syria , hezbollah , hamas , and american-backed , shia-dominated iraq oppose israel , saudi arabia , and much of the other sunni arab states all feel existentially threatened by iran ’s own ascendance .
fascination with liberal liberty came in poland and elsewhere at an odd moment . old social structures were destroyed , socialist customs , and habits vanished overnight ; former norms and unwritten rules were abandoned . in the postcolonial social revolution ( less often noted than the political and economic upheavals ) , families and communities were undermined , and ( at least in poland ) the church became excessively engaged in politics to help . at the same time , people were left to suffer from charges of change on their own . to be free but lonely , especially when dependence habits are ingrained .
at the same time , the crisis must not become a pretext for creating new institutional formats , which jeopardize the delicate balance among different eu institutions , a rebalancing that – through adequate adjustments – proved to be the test of time . the crisis , of course , highlight the need to strengthen the eu ’s institutions and instruments for shared action and coordination . we need the final and complete ratification of the lisbon treaty to have the institutionally and internationally stronger european union that we need . nor should today ’s uncertainties become a pretext for calling into question the need to continue and completing the eu ’s enlargement process . enlarging the eu ’s ’s ’s role in liberty and democracy , making peace , stability , and prosperity – particularly across eastern south-eastern europe – is in the interest of every european citizen .
a widely cited example of the outgoing government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s alleged economic mismanagement was its sugar-pricing policies . powerful sugarcane cooperatives , led by high-profile upa followers , supposedly drove the government to fix extravagant prices and write off sugar farmers ’ bad debts , leading to wasteful production . instead of defeating this system , as was expected , modi ’s government augmented subsidies to encourage higher output , raising import duties to fend off foreign competition , and raising the percentage of sugar-based ethanol needed to overhaul gasoline . his motivation is not hard to know : his bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) hopes that such concessions will help it wrest in control of maharashtra , india ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s main sugar-producing state , from the upa in the upcoming state assembly elections . that goal also explains another policy reversal , just as it did .
berlin – germany ’s social democratic democrats ( spd ) an existential crisis can no longer treat it as a typical party crisis . the party has captured a mere 9.7 % of the vote in bavaria ’s regional elections this month , and trailing both the populist alternative für deutschland ( afd ) and the greens on national opinion polls . with yet another important regional election fast approaching in hesse , polls indicate that the spd will lose still more support , if not as dramatically as in bavaria . the spd and the christian democratic union/christian social union ( cdu/csu ) have stood as the twin pillars of german politics since the end of world war ii . but , with the spd declining , germany is drifting from a de facto two-party system to a multiparty system in which no single party plays a dominant role .
while russia itself will not freeze accounts , president putin ’s meanings have been obvious : it would have been better for all parties if this money were brought home and invested in the national economy . to achieve this end , russia needs to establish a secure and attractive investment climate . most important , if the us is to roll back capital flight , the administration must persuade individual savers that they can deposit money and put aside it in demand . how can the us government expect to mobilize domestic investment for as long as ordinary russians keep their savings -- at $ 50 billion by most estimates at home ? russia ’s people need a convincing belief in the country ’s political stability -- that , for example , nobody can suggest nationalization , as happened repeatedly during the eight months that i was prime minister .
without gorbachev and his singular courage , inflows of events across europe during the fall of 1989 never materialized . for with gorbachev ’s ascendance , more and more people in east germany took heart and stop being feared for their repressive regime . they realized that east germany ’s realities were not fixed in stone after all ; to achieve the kind of change that many courageous dissidents and civil-rights proponents trapped behind the wall demanded for so long a while . their commitment against the injustices of the communist regime stands for me one of the top chapters in german history . opening hungary ’s frontiers , which fall and sought sanctuary by east germans in prague and warsaw , already shaken communist and stasi rule to its foundation .
as a result , some – however relatively speaking , not many – commit long and often perilous journeys to the developed world . and yet , upon reaching out to the affluent world ’s ’s ’s doorstep , a welcome being received is increasingly blended , as manufactured panic over the supposedly massive influxes of non-threatening outsiders closes space for humane , pragmatic answers . responsibility-sharing – the foundation of a modern international system for protecting refugees – is being replaced by responsibility-shifting , typically onto least-developed countries . it is high time to boot the global effort to protect refugees . what is needed is a comprehensive strategy with global reach , reflecting a sweeping vision that inspires and engages governments ; an aid community , business , development institutions , faith groups , academia , sports , sports , community , and arts .
munich – the euro crisis has gone through six phases , so far . it is worth recalling them because they show how policymakers stumbled along , trying to lay off fires without worrying ourselves about where their chosen path was headed . currently , markets remain calm , but this is only the beginning of the seventh phase of the crisis , during which europe becomes mired in debt . the sequence so far has been as follows : greece . the seventh stage of the crisis is one of heightened moral hazard , stemming from the run-up to debt .
from 1985 to 2005 , the boomsters have made ten-year projections that exaggerated the chances of major positive shifts in both financial markets ( for example , the dow jones industrial average of 36,000 ) and world policy ( such as the tranquility of the middle east and the dynamic of sub-saharan africa ) . they assigned probabilities from 65 % to the rosy scenarios that materialized only about 15 % of the time . during the same period , doomsters conducted even more poorly , exaggerating the odds of adverse shifts in all the same places that boomsters accentuated positive , plus a few more ( i still await the approaching disintegration in canada , nigeria , indonesia , south africa , thailand , and sudan ) . they assigned probabilities from 70 % to bleak scenarios that materialized just 12 % of the time . second , again , as the skeptics warned , over-claimers rarely pay penalties for doing badly .
at the same time , the economic challenges of brexit would have been overwhelming . the out campaign ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s main major economic argument – that britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s huge trade deficit is a secret weapon , because the eu would have more to lose than britain from a breakdown in commercial relationships – is flatly mistaken . britain would have to negotiate access to europe ’s single market for its service industries , whereas eu manufacturers would automatically enjoy the virtually unrestricted rights to sell whatever it wants in britain under world trade organization rules . margaret thatcher was the first to recognize that britain ’s own specialization in services – not only in finance , but also in law , accountancy , media , architecture , pharmaceutical r & d. and so on – makes eu membership in the single market critical . it makes little economic difference for germany , france , or italy , whether britain is an eu member , or simply at the wto
answering them will require a debate that transcends issues like the separation of powers and the judicial independence and the elucidates of the appropriate relationship between politics and religion . for it , understanding the historic context of the current crisis is crucial . when turkey became a democracy in 1950 , the previous system , conducted secular kemalist elites attempted to harness the power of the army and the bureaucracy to wield control over an elected government . indeed , the turkish military , with its support from the judiciary , intervened explicitly in the civilian government ’s functioning in 1960 ’s , 1971 , 1980 , and 1997 , each time in the name of protecting secularism . in response , various religious groups , including the gülen movement , encouraged their adherents to take positions in both the bureaucracy and the army .
berlin – during the long night of negotiations over greece on july 12-13 , something fundamental to europe ’s military cracked down . since then , europeans have been living in another type of eu . what changed that night was the germany that europeans came to know since the end of world war ii . on the surface , the negotiations were about averting a greek exit from the eurozone ( or a “ grexit ” ) , and the dire consequences that would follow for greece and the monetary union . at a deeper level , however , what was at stake was the role in europe of its most populous and economically most powerful country .
but the rise of arab military coalitions raises serious concerns , not least because the arab-led military history – unlike those practiced by westerners in places like bosnia , kosovo , and even libya – contains no promising precedent . typically , such interventions were intended to empowering a proxy political force over its military and political rivals , instead of averting a humanitarian disaster or institutionalizing a nonviolent conflict-resolution mechanism following world war ii . egypt ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s military intervention in yemen in the 1860s is a case in point . by the end of 1965 , egyptian president gamel abdel nasser delivered 70,000 troops in yemen to support a republican coup against royalist forces . despite using the banned chemical weapons against the yemeni guerillas between 1963 and 1967 – a first in intra-arab conflicts – egypt failed to achieve its goals .
the reform process was led by oecd countries , opening up to developing countries only after this starting package was unveiled . today , there are 125 countries , formed a group known as the “ “ inclusive ” framework . beps were no doubt an important step toward tackling some of the most egregious tax-avoidance strategies used by multinational companies . for example , it started sharing among country-by-country tax authorities reporting on such firms ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ profits and tax payments . unfortunately , that norm will apply only to very large multinational companies , and news stories will not be publicly available , depriving civil society of an essential transparency tool .
and even eliminating accelerated depreciation would not broaden the us tax base enough to finance a rate cut to more than 28 % . likewise , while limiting the deductibility of net interest to corporations , as many other developed countries did , would widen the us tax base and discourage excessive reliance on debt financing , raising the fiscal burden on major investments in physical capital that are often debt-financed . reducing tax preferences for noncorporate business actors ( for example , partnerships ) that pass on their revenue through on behalf of their owners ’ ’ ’ individual returns would also widen the tax base . pass-through companies now account for more than 80 % of net business income ( by far the highest share among advanced countries ) . several of these entities are extremely large and profitable , enjoying the same legal advantages as corporations .
israel ’s disengagement plan presents the evacuation of gaza ’s settlements as an end to 37 years of occupation . at the same time , however , israel insists that it will have no attributes of its sovereignty , and that it will continue to be governed by existing arrangements covering most aspects of security and civilian administration . this implies continuing access to the israeli military into gaza , and maintaining control over border crossings , airspace , and territorial waters . nor will israeli troops withdraw from the land strip along the palestinian-egyptian border . these conditions exclude any possibility of forging a security plan that receives the backing of all factions , including hamas .
nearly 60 years later , america ’s agricultural employment peaked at 53 % of total employment . today , it is less than 3 % below the poverty line . in fact , since at least until the 1980 ’s , most countries have experienced large declines in agricultural employment . in some , such as portugal , malaysia , turkey , and indonesia , the proportion of agricultural employment has declined by more than 20 % . in others , such as greece , italy , bulgaria , bulgaria , hungary , estonia , poland , the philippines , and sri lanka , the decline has exceeded 10 % .
islamabad -- just as pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on february 18 , many observers are hopeful that the vote will usher in a period of stability and calm through lending of popular legitimacy toward the government . at times , however , when democracy serves the best of refusing participation in it . the upcoming elections , to be held under the illegal provisional constitutional order ( pco ) implemented following president pervez musharraf ’s state of emergency on november 3 , are such a case in point , precisely because my own party and its coalition partners are boycotting the vote . to be sure , post-election contesting would give my party a huge opportunity to take issues to the people . in fact , my party ’s support has grown stronger , with opinion polls now indicating that it is the second most popular in frontier province – and gaining ground in every other province .
and it ’s a good thing for the formal sector to devote more attention to joblessness – a very good thing . yet , sadly , this shift will do nothing to address the problem that devour on the social fabric of any society . just as bernanke and others wish otherwise – and just as bickering politicians seek to dump policy accountability on others ’ – central banks lack the right tools to deal with an component of an unemployment crisis that results from inadequate investment in education , skills training , and physical capital . likewise , they can not fix debt overhangs , repair broken home financing , or address medium-term fiscal-reform challenges on their own . the best that central banks can do is to buy time , albeit at an incremental cost , for other policymaking entities to get their act together .
in fact , china ’s dam builders are targeting most of the transnational rivers that flow out of chinese territory . much of china ’s ’s ’s internationally shared water resources lie on the tibetan plateau , which it annexed during the early 1950s . unsurprisingly , the plateau is china ’s new construction hub . indeed , china ’s ’s 13th five-year plan , released earlier this year , calls for a new wave of dam projects across the plateau . moreover , china recently cut off the brahmaputra river flows , the lifelines of bangladesh , and northern india to build a dam as part of a major hydroelectric project in tibet .
washington , dc – ten years after the failure of lehman brothers , we know that multilateral action was crucial to preventing a so-called great recession from becoming even worse than it otherwise would have been . back then , it was the global financial system that was tottering . today , it is the global trading system that is at jeopardy . over the last 70 years , multilateralism has served the world well . much to its credit , the united states has eschewed retribution and reparations after world war ii .
at the same time , schools were multiplying as the attendance surged . other public services became better , as when parents believed that their children would lead more prosperous lives than they and previous generations had . this was certainly true of my parents who sacrificed much to lift their nine-year-old children . they were not pleased when their older sons became communists in the 1860s , strongly opposing the brutal regime of hafez al-assad , syrian president bashar al-assad ’s father . but this was not farfetched to transformations in a town where people felt new identities – like the nasserist , baathist , islamist , or communist – downplaying their regional and tribal origins .
this scores of high turnover , owing to overwork , and an increased need for foreign-born health-care workers to fill the sorely needed positions . gcc policymakers were right to focus on increasing access and subsidies for quality health care . but the equitable distribution of health-care services across native and migrant populations often creates thorny policy issues . and now , policymakers need to devote more attention to the health-care workforce itself , ensuring that it is properly educated , and trained for challenges that await the region . training programs in gcc national health systems today do not focus almost enough on innovation or systems thinking to improve efficiency and effectiveness .
if the army collapses , it is algeria [ and ] france that collapses . the decisive moment came when de gaulle , in military uniform , went on tv to demonstrate his mastery of a new medium . “ well , darling and the old country , ” here we again face a heavy test , ” ” ” ” ” ” he declared . insisting that self-determination was the only way ahead ; it invited the army to reject an even passive association with an uprising , and devoted it to restoring public rule . should the state walt out before the challenge it faced , “ france would be no more than the wretched , shattered playthings on an ocean of insecurity , ” he cautioned .
just when the world reached the consensus that ahmadinejad was simply an instrument of supreme leader ayatollah khamenei , ahmadinejad appointed a vice president against khamenei ’s desire ( though later retracted his appointment ) . what we do know with certainty is that the regime is in disarray . these divisions will allow the new forces to emerge into iranian society . so all means should be found to reach out to iranian society at all levels . iranian students should be encouraged to visit and study in asian universities , where they discover how confident young chinese and indian students are about the future − potentially very likely to cause them to reflect on why young iranians are not sharing that optimism .
how can one evaluate the contribution of light infant-infaning against providing critical enablers like helicopters or air-to-air refueling refueling tankers ? over what time period makes your calculus ? common funding , with all members paying a share based on gdp , is one tool that can then be used for more equitable burden sharing . traditionally , nato has applied a policy of “ “ “ costs ” lie where it falls : each member has chosen all the costs to the operational contributions it has made to alliance operations . during the last few years , nato ’s post-brexit finance policy has been updated to permit common funding as an inducement to provide some kind of theater-level allowing capabilities , such as medical facilities , airports handling soldiers , and supplies or intelligence .
moreover , one might argue that easy money alone has contributed to an unexpectedly powerful deflationary forces perceived in recent years . owing to easy financing and regulatory forbearance , aggregate supply rose as “ zombification ” companies proliferated . meanwhile , aggregate demand was constrained by debt headwinds – yet another outcome of easy monetary conditions . given these conditions , continuing to insist on monetary easing appears to be especially nefarious . with so much potential dangers on the horizon , central bankers should at least consider the rethinking of fundamental assumptions underlying their policies .
so , among the wrong set of possibilities , the least bad appears to be cooperating with america . yet cooperation with the us may not gain much from the al-sauds , because saudi relations with america are strained to a breaking point . ever since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington last year , the regime — once central to american strategic interests in the region — has been made to feel dispensable by an american that drops powerful hints that there are alternatives to saudi military outposts , even to saudi oil . though the saudis were not included in president bush 's ’s side “ axis of evil , ” ” some american policymakers now view the country as the “ kernel of evil . ” al-qaeda ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s terrorist network is perceived directly by fundamentalist wahhabi doctrines that constitute an integral part of the saudi regime .
how victims remember trauma is the most controversial issue facing psychology and psychiatry today . many theorists of clinical trauma believes that battling , rape , and other terrifying experiences are seemingly graved around the mind , never to be forgotten . others disagree , arguing that the mind can protect itself by banishing memory of trauma from awareness , make it hard for the victims to remember their most horrific experiences until they are safe to do so many years later . while acknowledging that trauma is often all too memorable , these sorts of clinical trauma theorists assert that a condition known as “ “ traumatic dissociative ” amnesia leaves a large minority of victims unable to memory its trauma , precisely because it was so thoroughly terrifying . such clinical trauma theorists , however , do not argue that “ the repressed ” or “ dissociated ” ” ” ” memories of deadly events are either inert or benign .
in calcutta , with some younger kid arriving along and insisting on joining a play that my friends played , we would let the new kid in , but only after whispering into one another ’s ears the words , elé belé . an elé belé is a player who thinks he is participating , but in truth only steps through motions . everybody knew that a goal scored on him was not a valid goal . as a child , mastering elé ’s vicious art was important . when a new kid arrived , accompanied by a doting mother , we could convey to one another with a little more than a little watching that olmert would be an elé belé .
new york – the financial times stock exchange rose almost 22 % year on year in 2017 – its best performance since the post-crisis rebound in 2009 . as the growth pessimism of recent years fades , some of the warnings that they have made over the last few years seem to have become obsolete . northwestern university ’s robert gordon has argued , for example , that the american economy is bound to decelerate in a slowdown because today ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s technological innovations will not boost growth to the level they have experienced in the past . harvard ’s lawrence summers has drawn much attention from his argument that the world risks backsliding toward “ secular stagnation , ” ” ” ” ” ” because the interest rate needed to bring desired investment into line with desired savings was below zero . yet , while nil lower bound no longer appears to be a binding constraint , there are potential causes for concern , one of which concerns about debt levels .
in fact , china has been damming most international rivers flow out of tibet , whose fragile ecosystem is already threatened with global warming . so far , the only rivers on which no hydro-engineering works have featured are those indus , whose basin has collapsed mostly in india and pakistan , as well as the salween , which flows to burma and thailand . local authorities in yunnan province , however , are contemplating damming the salween in the quake-upstream region . india ’s ’s government has been pressing china for transparency , greater hydrological data-sharing , and a commitment not to redirect the natural flow of any rivers or to reduced cross-border water flows . but even a joint expert-level mechanism – established in 2007 simply for “ “ interaction and collaboration ” on hydrological data – has shown little value .
perhaps , but most students of monetary policy view quantitative easing as textbook policies for pulling the economy out of a zero-interest-rate “ liquidity trap ” – thereby avoiding the onset of persistent deflation in order to aggravate debt burdens . as for china ’s ’s renminbi , a highly political exchange-rate regime remains to be supported . in the end , china ’s ’s ’s ’s rapid growth will have to reflect a major rise in its currency , its domestic price level , or both . but , in 2011 , most equilibration will probably occur through inflation . finally , currency chaos is the safest bet for all , with sharp and unpredictable swings in floating exchange rates worldwide .
without such collaboration , it would damage china ’s aspirations only through domestic factors , such as a faltering economy , rising social discontent , worsening ecological crises , or vicious politics . that way , countries should take the lead in reining in china ’s revisionist ambitions ? with the us distracting from other strategic challenges – not to mention its domestic presidential campaign – asia ’s ’s ’s other powers – – – in particular , an economically surging india and a more politically assertive japan – are the best job candidates . both india and japan are longstanding us-led stakeholders , stressing in their own international relations the values that america espouses , like the need to maintain a stable balance of power , respect a territorial and maritime status quo , and preserving freedom of navigation . moreover , they have demonstrated their shared desire to reaffirm the contemporary asian order .
at the same time , developed countries should fulfill their pledges under the convention to provide financial aid and technology transfers to enable developing countries to address climate change effectively . moreover , adequate mechanisms and institutional arrangements should be established for adaptation , financing , and technology transfers . and developing countries will , when it comes to sustainable development , and with measurable , reportable , and verifiable support in terms of financing , technology , and capacity-building , take nationally appropriate mitigation steps . the global financial crisis has no doubt exacerbated the climate-change challenge . but , because climate change represents an even more far-reaching and serious challenge , the world must not waver in its determination and commitment to addressing it .
florence – earlier this month , jim yong kim abruptly resigned from his post as world bank president , leaving a pillar of an international financial order free of guidance or direction . kim would join a private-equity firm where he believes that he can “ do our utmost to affect major global issues like climate change . ” following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
a <UNK> ter-money version would be the purchasing of zero-interest-rate government bonds that will not be repaid , either because they are perpetual bonds , or because they are rolled over each time they mature . that is arguably what the bank of japan is currently doing . boj governor haruhiko kuroda has reportedly said directly to underwrite the budget deficit is not an option . moreover , he has initiated a policy of replacing government-bond yields on the boj ’s ’s balance sheet once they have mature , while steadily increasing the volume of government debt on the central bank ’s books . this comes after years of pronouncements by prominent economists , including berkeley ’s brad delong and former us federal reserve chair ben bernanke , that helicopter money provides a way for overcoming deflation ( with which japan has struggled for decades ) .
start in the summer of 2015 , he embraced extremist rhetoric appealing to nativism , islamophobia , and anger against gop elites . media outlets provided as much as $ 2 billion worth of free coverage , helping him grab , and hold headlines in polls and most sundays . trump ’s ’s ’s core supporters are unjustly thought of being displaced and economically insecure blue-collar workers . in fact , his electorate ’ median per capita income , some $ 72,000 , is well above the american median of $ 56,000 . his supporters resemble the tea partiers : overwhelmingly elderly , males , the middle class , and the white .
once a group of young people is viewed as irretrievable , attention shifts away from them as moral individuals . they become soulless bodies , and a moral circle closes in to exclude them . our reactions to soulless bodies are well illustrated in a story telling descartes after they were killed . descartes was known that descartes had an illegitimate daughter , a francine who died when he was five years old . by the story , descartes had so much hit with grief that he created an automaton , a mechanical doll built to appear identical to his dead daughter .
but the terrorist attacks in istanbul are unlikely to generate any nervous reaction to the restricting of democratic rights . if al-qaeda were to fall behind the attacks , it grossly miscalculated . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’s reaction summed up turkish sentiment : “ these bombs are aimed at destroying the zone of peace and stability in our country . we will not , therefore , change our course . if those bombings are intended to send a message , i sweep it off and crush it beneath the feet . ”
nevertheless , khamenei ’s invocation of the law echoes the claims by many conservative-pragmatists who lean toward mousavi , who are out of their positions for challenging khamenei ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s authority directly . mousavi has had to carry out his legal campaign carefully without compromising the trust that he won from most iranians . he must oppose his two principal demands : the null of the election and the establishment of an impartial committee to rule on the government ’s charges of electoral rule . should mousavi persuade khamenei to reconsider his position , the supreme leader ’s hold on power will be shaken . if khamenei holds fast , mousavi can not gain the presidency , but he will continue to represent the hopes of most iranians who differ dramatically with his rule .
there is also something even more important than one ’s ’s ’s ’s reputation . a political leader has greater opportunity than almost anyone else to help the people , and this should have been yanukovych ’s top priority . but , even if yanukovych were thinking mainly about his own personal interests , his quest for personal enrichment was irrational . imagine that he gave up to ask himself what would make him happier . imagine that , with that question in mind , he had compared the alternative to heedless lifestyle ( with a private zoo and pirate-ship restaurant ) with to living comfortably at substantial pay to which he was entitled while knowing that he was governing with integrity and doing his best to make better things for ukraine ’s citizens .
north korea , for its part , has been far less forthcoming about its intentions . it remains to be seen whether it is trying to engage the rest of the world in more constructive and consistent terms , or whether dprk officials and diplomats are merely placing good faces in order to deflect international attention from their country ’s reputation as a nuclear-armed weapons-better monger and a human-rights violator . indeed , the incheon visit comes in as part of mixed messages . two days before the north korean delegation arrived , the committee for the peaceful reunifying of korea ( cprk ) that is formally part of the korean workers ’ party denounced the “ south korean puppet force ” denounced the “ south korean puppet force in serious violation of north-south joint statements and pushed north-south ties into the worst disaster . ” on the incheon day of the incheon visit , north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s bellicose state news agency continued bellicose and derogatory language to south korea and the us : “ lurking behind this is an ulterior design to [ america ’s ] ulterior design ] zealously the south korean puppet forces into escalating the confrontation with the dprk and flashed [ tek ] a second korean war in a second korean war .
when an idea becomes both intuit and actually bogus , it is often because it applies on one level but not on the level at which it applies . yes , people do specialize , and should specialize , too . everybody benefits from each one of us becomes good at different things , and then exchanging our knowhow with others . it is not efficient for the dentist and the lawyer . but individual level specialization actually leads to greater diversification .
gene-drive organisms are intended to spread indefinitely , and mosquitos , particularly females , can surf air currents at relatively high altitudes ( 40-290 feet , or 131-951 feet ) , where winds can blow them hundreds of miles . this means that consent would have to be assured vastly beyond the release point.subscribe nowh4 { text-align : center ; } for a limited time ; get only unlimited access toon toon point ; the big picture ; and a ps archive plus our annual magazine , to just $ 75 subscribeyet in villages near bana , close to bana , authorities told us that despite meeting with targets malaria still suffering the consequences of adverse consequences . likewise , civil-society groups operating in and around the test-site villages have not been adequately consulted about target malaria ’s work.the more interviews i conducted , the clearer it becomes that the local people have not engaged in a genuinely participatory debate on the project of malaria , let alone extended their informed consent . by contrast , several people i interviewed called for the experimental release of genetically modified mosquitos until the risks and effects had been adequately investigated ; and civil society across burkina faso had completely informed.target malaria ’s lack of commitment to consent reflects its own rhetoric , which eschews the unequivocal word “ consent , ” but periodically uses terms like “ engagement ” and “ acceptance of community acceptance . ” this choice may indicate that the organization ’s leaders have already chosen to go along release.reinforcing this conclusion , following the un
many more have simply become discouraged and dropped out of the labor force altogether : rather than in school , rather than in jobs and not looking for work . they do not protest too much , but many end up in jail . the world 's labor markets are now interwoven together . young people in countries as diverse as egypt and the u.s. are in effect competing with young chinese and indians for jobs . china 's lowest-skilled , reasonably productive manufacturing workers , and high-quality infrastructure ( roads , power , ports , and communications ) have set the standard for competitiveness globally .
article 7 of the lisbon treaty provides for the eu to suspend the rogue eu member states ’ voting rights . but , because this “ nuclear option ” requires a unanimous vote by all eu member states , everyone knows that it will never be used . indeed , article 7 is such an ineffective deterrent that it serves rule-breakers ’ interests by all but guaranteeing not just that doing so will not go unpunished . orbán has been scamping the eu for years , and encouraging other populists to pursue his own authoritarian goals – and , with eu funds to boot . but the weakening of the rule of law is not only a domestic issue in hungary or poland .
in iraq , bush then pursued a unilateralist agenda , stating that there was an incontrovertible evidence of the links with the al qaeda , and that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction . even before the invasion , there was overwhelming evidence that bush lay . detection technology made it clear that it did not possess nuclear weapons , as the chief un inspector hans blix pointed out . it is possible that bush read these messages , but that they were beyond his comprehension . it is also conceivable that he did not believe what he had read .
all of these groups are driven by a nihilistic rage born of hostility toward non-sunnis and a rejection of modernity . sadly , as sri lanka ’s bombing and other attacks in asia demonstrate , defeating isis in syria and iraq has only intensified the challenge of terrorism , because battle-hardened combatants with operating exercises to stage savage attacks are now coming home . the presence of such returnees in sri lanka explains how obscure local groups managed to conduct sophisticated , near-simultaneous strikes on three churches and three hotels , use military-grade explosive devices . returnees is present in many other asian countries as well , from the philippines and indonesia to the maldives and uzbekistan . like osama bin laden and other al-qaeda leaders who cut their teeth in the us-backed war against the soviets in afghanistan , this new generation of jihadist veterans might haunt us security in asia , the middle east , and the west for years to come .
denver – angelina jolie ’s new film , “ “ in the land of blood and honey , ” is about the ethnic tensions that have spawned the bloodiest conflict in europe since the end of world war ii . the film has already championed two awards , and it is an emerging box-office achievement , attesting to enduring interest – and perhaps arcane – that the balkan countries hold for international audiences who were just as horrified by the 1990 ’s events . for those of us who have lived and worked in the region during this turbulent decade , the post-yugoslav wars remain fresh blows . as jolie ’s movie so ably revealing , neither the international community nor local leaders have made a concerted effort to avert the carnage . one exception , perhaps the sole exception , was keiziro gligorov , macedonia ’s president , who had died while sleeping at new year ’s day in 94 ’s age .
there is strong evidence of falling foreign investment , and this contributes to the economy ’s disappointing level of investment overall . moreover , this trend accentuates the challenges of weak productivity growth . there are also signs that uk-based companies have begun to trigger their brexit contingency plans , after an extended period of waiting , scheduling , and more waiting . in addition to shifting investment away from the uk , firms will also begin relocating jobs . and that process will likely accelerate , even if british prime minister theresa may manages to craft her proposed exit deal through parliament .
she advocates local decision-making whenever possible and efficient , but she also supports national and european-level decision-making where this is appropriate ; the key is that processes should be flexible and allow citizen participation . she recognizes that shared sovereignty will make europe more influential , thus empowering its citizens . and she views globalization as a good thing , but understands that it needs to be managed through durable , efficient international agreements and institutions . currently , opinion polls are being bouncing wildly , owing to fillon ’s scandal and a surge in hamon among left-wing voters outside the socialist party ’s socialist party . but if macron qualifies for a second round , he would pose a greater threat to le pen than the outright left-wing candidate would .
the european project represents a realist reaction to globalization and its challenge . it was initiated to create “ solidarités , ” promoting political stability and consolidating democracy and europe ’s social model . having achieved those goals , europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world development . this is not a form of nostalgia for the past glorification . an unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across europe , as was apparent in a collective mourning and a outpouring of compassion toward spain ; we need to build on that enormous potential to shape the cause of global solidarity .
for starters , there is his response to queen elizabeth ii ’s now-famous question : “ “ why did nobody see it coming ? ” krugman ’s ’s cheerful reaction is that the new keynesians surveyed looked the other way . theirs was an inability not of theory , but of data collection . crucially , they had “ overlooked ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” crucial institutional changes to the financial system . while this was regrettable , it raised no “ deep conceptual questions ” – that is , it did not demand that they rethink their theories .
the same can not be said for the kaczyński.another major difference is that eastern europeans tend to hold more materialist attitudes than westerners , who have moved beyond concerns about physical security to embrace what the sociologist ronald inglehart calls post-materialist values . one aspect of this difference is that eastern european societies have become more vulnerable to attacks on abstract liberal institutions , such as freedom of speech and judicial independence.this should not be all too surprising . after all , liberalism in eastern europe today is western import . notwithstanding trump and brexit phenomena , both america and the uk have deeply embedded cultures of political and social liberalism . in eastern europe , civil society is not only weaker ; it has also focused more on areas like charity , religion , and leisure than political issues.moreover , in the vastly different political landscape of europe ’s postcommunist states , the left is either extremely weak or totally absent from the political mainstream .
but that is a big thing to say , if one does . as for the eurozone , we seem to have been overly optimistic despite the fact that we foresaw the decline in potential growth rate to just 1.5 % . nowadays , most forecasters have placed the region ’s growth potential at around 1 % . unless germany can shift to a more domestic-demand-driven growth model , that projection will probably turn out to be right . yet , while most press coverage has focused on germany ’s falling exports and manufacturing output , the country ’s service sector remains strong .
the magnitude of such transfers , however , would depend on eu financial policies at their admission ’s moment , an outcome of accession negotiations , and economic upheaval in turkey . in any case , the eu ’s practice of “ capping ” its budget would prevent an explosion in the funding costs entailed by turkey ’s accession . immigration should not be a cause for undue concern , either . human mobility is limited , and turkey ’s workforce would probably be allowed to move freely within the eu only after a long transition period , possibly not until 2025 . given the expected upswing in turkey ’s economy , and its falling birthrate , the experts predict an estimated 2.7 million migrants figure by this point .
more than most people realize , the gospels treat recalcitrant jews – those who refuse to accept jesus like their messiah -- as the perpetrators of a crime that lives in each generation . anti-semites often cite passing a passage in matthew , in which a jewish mob cheers for christ ’s execution and voluntarily accept lasting guilt : “ his blood be on us and our children . ” matthew then attributes to jews a recurrent lie explaining away the resurrection and the disappearance of jesus ’s body : “ his disciples come at night , stealing it away while we slept . ” the later evangelist john concludes that , because jews deny the christian messiah they must be “ sons of the devil . ” just as whites attribute the extraordinary sex powers to blacks , the christian west ’s instinct is to treat the jews like the masters of extraordinary force -- including the power to slay the deities and control world finance .
but , with its over-stretched macho , soundly politics and provincialism , the reform never happened . so the notion that “ this country is different , ” that the rules of global finance did not apply has proved utter nonsense . by the time the crisis came , thailand looked like all the others rolling in its desperation to the imf . thailand ’s decision last may to cut interest rates made it a safe gamble to bet against bhat , an opening salvo in the crisis . emboldened by the illusion of a strong reserve position , the thai central bank took on -- and lost .
it was not least thanks to efforts to protest movements that france has now made concessions on both counts . but how can those concessions be secure under duress ? that is a task in which non-governmental organizations and protest movements are ill-equipped : they can stir up the public ’s conscience , but they can not formally commit governments . only other governments , too , can do that . hence the drive to nail down the concessions that the protests have extracted , the hour of governments arrived .
compounding the challenge , the cohorts of informed elites in russia are mounting . as the top russian propagandist , dmitry kiselev , recently acknowledged , “ higher learning in the humanities ( and the social sciences ) breeds social strife . not surprisingly , he has complained that “ “ “ too many ” russians study those subjects . ” ukraine ’s large population will not become well-informed overnight . but , as the regime is being forced to dedicate more resources to silencing informed , the majority will suffer economically .
london – officials at the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) have long insisted that the us will not weaponize the renminbi . and yet , implicit in its promise not to manipulate the currency for strategic ends is their ability to do so if it so desired . china ’s ’s monetary policies have come to the fore , now that us president donald trump has imposed import tariffs on a range of chinese goods . many wonder whether china will respond to trump ’s trade war by threatening a currency war . if it does , the world should call his bluff .
it would seem that , beyond contributing to the size and productivity of the labor force , migrants also often complement native-born workers ’ skills , help them earn more . my own professional focus on economics is thus what i have highlighted about the role of growth . but that clearly is not the only factor behind the rise of populist nationalism . changing culturally , perhaps even more , matters for developed countries as well . in america , for example , the foreign-born share of the population grew from 5 % in 1960 to about 14 % today .
that shift , in turn , clears the way for a generational shift in leadership – and , more important , a transition to post-oslo politics . plo ’s old guard – men like yasser arafat and abbas , who led the liberation organization from exile and returned home with the oslo accords – has dominated the palestinian political landscape up until now . after walking away from the scene , palestinian leaders born under occupation , and spent time in israeli prisons , will most likely fill the vacuum . the most prominent such figure is marwan barghouti , a student leader at birzeit university in the 1980 ’s and one of the leading organizers of the first intifada , resulting in his deportation by israel in the late 1980 ’s . having been arrested and sentenced to a long prison term on charges that he ran a second intifada that began over two years , rending some of its military assault .
these are the key ingredients in a nationalist thug that seems to appeal to the russians nowadays . judging putin ’s most recent address to the parliament , his regime seems acutely aware of the dangers posed by populist nationalists . the regime is likely to try to counter this eruption of nationalism , while preserving its powerful statist rhetoric . but , in defeating the far right , putin ’s regime will be forced to take its stand on more or less liberal ideological grounds . this will not be easy for a regime based on its twin pillars of red tape and security apparatus .
in taiwan , tsai is equally committed to this . last year , responding to public opposition to nuclear energy in the wake of japan ’s fukushima meltdown in 2011 , tsai vowed to make taiwan a nuclear-free by 2025 . today , coal and natural gas provide more than two-thirds of the country ’s ’s ’s electricity needs , with renewables accounting for 5 % . tsai has called on renewables to rise to 20 % over the next eight years , with capacity coming mostly from solar and offshore wind . this new load would easily replace rural electricity .
as production of these fuels grows , we will require policies , programs , and capacity to ensure that they use sustainably , without distorting food markets or compromising food security , which will always be the top priority . the pioneers of biofuels would most likely have been surprised by how little they contribute to worldwide fuel supplies today . rudolf diesel ’s first engine , designed in the late 900s , ran on fuel derived from peanut oil . henry ford once scouted florida in the hope of purchasing land tracts to plant sugarcane , convinced that the united states would not tolerate pollution from burning fossil fuels or dependency on importing oil in order to produce gasoline . in recent decades , biofuels have regained their initial appeal , owing to efforts to secure affordable energy , generate revenue , and relax dependency on which ford has warned .
many britons believed in the “ free-trade empire ” of the world . others fanned the flames of anglo-german antagonism , caricaturing protectionist germany as a barbarian society surviving on horse sausages and dog-meat ; lloyd george , a future prime minister told audiences that he was more fearful of the “ german ” sausage than he was for the german naval man . one reason that free trade defeated protectionism in britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people ’s emotion and identity , rather than just their aspirational interests of more wealth and cheap food . liberals and radicals organized traveling , color posters , and political amusement . in towns , displays in shop windows illustrated the cost of ordinary consumers .
inordinately lax regulatory environments have proven lethal , encouraging northern european banks to pad their balance sheets with southern european government and bank bonds . when the bubble bursts , it left in its wake in its woefully costly economies losing their competitiveness . europeans now should take advantage of calm on storm fronts to re-think europe ’s currency union from the ground up . the effort to create the european equivalent of the us dollar and to impose a fiscal union at the top of it , despite the absence of a common european state , is bound to fail . it turns member countries into debtors and creditors alike , stoking even greater animosity .
indeed , the latter now stands at more than 15 % of gdp . the hits chinese exports are likely to take as a result of the region ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s currency depreciations are , nevertheless , unlikely to be any immediate feeling . the rival asian economies will need to be stabilized before they can push their exports aggressively . moreover , inflation in some asean countries may rise with the coming of floating exchange rates . because of this , their exports ’ price competitiveness may bear recurring .
moreover , there are genuine disagreements within america ’s bureaucracy when it comes to assessing the threat that al qaeda in mali poses for american interests . following from above , therefore , there has been some operational and symbolic significance . operationally , it limits on isr and does not involve ground troops . symbolically , it means backing initial and substantial efforts undertaken by others . for europeans , this state of affairs is worrying about two counts .
the private sector experienced large foreign assets , while the government covered up about equal quantities of foreign liabilities . even so , argentina went bankrupt because wealthy argentines spirited their assets out of the country out of the whole , out of the reach of government , while poor argentines refused to pay the taxes needed to please foreign creditors ’ claims . on the other side , with a country ’s foreign assets held not by households , but by institutions such as pension funds could identify and taxed them . most of all , this is the case in europe today . this analysis suggests that the “ excessive [ current-account ] imbalances ” that are required under the ongoing reform of eurozone governance goes in the right direction .
disappointed in their political leaders , algerians stems largely from their shared love of soccer . the stars of barcelona , real madrid , chile , and milan are household names . but exposure to foreign tv stations also implies that many disillusioned algerians are looking toward escaping against italy , france , or germany as their only chance of employment and prosperity . will the coming months bring genuine change for algeria ? will social and economic reform be pursued to secure an equitable distribution of countries ’ oil and gas wealth ?
lower interest rates worked , but not so much because they boosted investment , but because they drove households to refinance their mortgages and fueled a housing-price bubble . in short , as greenspan departs , he leaves behind the american economy burdened by heavy household and government debt and fragile balance sheets – a legacy that already contributes to global financial fragility . still , it remains unclear what led greenspan to endorse the tax cut . was this massive economic misjudgment , or was he deferring favor with the bush administration ? the most likely explanation lies in the combination of the two , for he and bush pursued the same “ starved ” political strategy that calling for tax cuts to put revenues down , thereby pushing the public sector to downsize .
ethiopia is hardly the only recent example of how conflict over land rights can set the stage for political and humanitarian crises . competition for arable land contributed to the rwandan genocide in 1994 . an historic drought may have forged the conditions for syria ’s civil war . and food insecurity , owing to land mismanagement , is an important factor driving migrants toward europe . land-related issues will continue to threaten global stability , particularly if the effects of climate change exacerbate existing problems .
because they lead far more carbon-intensive lifestyles than everyone else , they would contribute far more per capita in the form of a carbon dividend . more to the point , they would pay far more in return than they get back , while the poorest 60 % of americans would get back more than they put into it . in short , a carbon dividend would redistribute money from predominantly wealthy high-polluters to predominantly low – and middle-income polluters all while cutting co2 emissions . on its own , this would represent a clever step in the right direction – one that would n’t invite a “ yellow vest ” reaction . but do n’t allow someone to tell you this ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s silver bullet .
a further lesson for germany ’s sarkozy is that an enlightened corporate state requires supportive political leadership as well as accommodating trade unions . german chancellor angela merkel does not make speeches attacking a strong europe and a european central bank ’s price-stability mandate . on the contrary , she supports an independent ecb , and has let germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s trade unions and companies know that they will have to live with hard currency and anti-inflationary monetary policies . this is not to say that merkel is a free-market capitalist – there is little evidence of this . rather , she simply understands that for an economy that needs a competitive , bad-mouthing europe and the ecb are sending the wrong signals .
because of its geopolitical weight , germany ’s perspective is now synonymous with this european union . and the eu is not that of a hegemon ; rather , it concerns the rule of law , integration , and a peaceful reconciliation of member states ’ own interests . germany ’s place alone makes nationalism a bad idea ; and , besides , its most fundamental political and economic interests depend on a powerful , prosperous eu – particularly in trump ’s age . germany lies in the same boat as all other europeans with respect to security . just as there can be no french security without germany , no german security can exist without poland .
the same applies to antidepressant drugs as well . there is no dispute that ect can cause short-term memory loss . but the critics have found it hard to demonize memory or other cognitive difficulties that endure beyond three months . nor can persistent autobiographical memory disturbances and the inability to recall lists be readily attributed to ect , because ect is rarely given on its head . indeed , very few of those receiving ect also receive the benzodiazepines , causing major autobiographical memory problems when given on their own , and a antipsychotic drugs that create difficulties in teaching lists or phone numbers , as well as other comparable ones .
if they were , there would be no need for domestic bankruptcy laws that spells out issues like precedence and fair treatment . but no government has found cacs adequate to resolving domestic restructuring . so why should we believe that they would be suffice in a far more complex sovereign-debt world ? in particular , cacs seem to have suffered on the issue of a “ dithering ” strategy . if a cac required , say , 75 % of holders of each bond class , the vultures could have bought 26 % of only one bond class , blocking total restructuring .
the eu should reinvigorate the case for an open dialogue and tough bargaining – precisely what has long been missing from western politics on the crisis in ukraine , and make the eu ’s post-soviet eurasian region irreversible . we have arrived at this point precisely because both russia and the west have spent more than ten years seeking unilateral privileges and eschewing negotiated compromises . holding talks in the current atmosphere of mistrust , mutual recrimination , and fearmongering will demand hefty investment of political capital for an extended period . moving beyond the current , adversarial approaches to finding common ground will take time . a quick deal will do little good .
but it also represents the global gold standard in many fields , including technology , defense , and research and development . contrary to china ’s ’s ’s ’s statist legacy , american ’s historical experience instilled in citizens and leaders ’ loyalty to liberty , including free markets and local autonomy . america ’s federal government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s size and power grew only very slowly until the 1930s , when the new deal – which included federal programs , public works projects , and funding reform and regulation – was carried out in response to the great depression . america ’s federal government expanded again during and after wwii , reflected the country ’s new global hegemony and the prosperity of its middle class ( created in no small part by a new deal ’s support for unionization and home ownership ) . the us government assumed a larger role in areas ranging from defense and foreign policies to health and social security .
the precise number of european combatants receiving training from isis and returning home are still unknown . abdelhamid abdelhamid abaaoud , who hosted the november 2015 paris attacks , has claimed to be one of the 90 isis-trained terrorists in europe . isis has reportedly trained 400-600 fighter jets for “ outside operations ” involving urban guerrilla warfare , improvisational equipment ( ieds ) , surveillance , counter-security , and forgery . isis has so far hit france and turkey hardest . france has incurred more than 230 deaths and some 700 injured , while turkey has endured more than 220 deaths and some 900 injured .
to account for learning crises in many developing countries , governments and development agencies should be looking for more opportunities to shape strategic partnerships with non-state providers . in bangladesh , for example , brac schools employ female teachers ( which is key to boosting girls ’ enrollment ) and outperform government-run schools in terms of learning outcomes . fortunately , the afghan government has begun to open its doors to innovative ngo models , like brac ’s community-based learning programs . but a shortage of qualified female teachers makes scaling up such efforts hard to impossible . women account for just one-third of all educators in afghan primary and secondary schools , partly owing to an exceptionally low level of female literacy .
these economic shocks have exposed the massive costs of each country ’s ’s sectarian-based political system . and protesters , fueled by economic grievances , were emboldened by the upgrading of broader security conditions , owing to the defeat of the islamic state and the wind-down of the war in syria . in all four of these countries , the severity of economic mismanagement reflects the long-standing use of state expenditures to fund the regime ’s own allies and clients , rather than benefiting entire populations . these regimes dominated each country ’s private sector through cronyism , not only to extract and distribute rents to their clients ; they also blocked the emergence of autonomous entities that might finance an opposition movement . as a result , capital and skill were misallocated ; the commercial climate deteriorated ; and competition , innovation and growth suffered .
but the decreased flexibility in responding to economic shocks will surely test this . at present , it brazenly emphasizes the disparate , even discordant , fiscal reactions now being embraced by european union governments . this raises the old question of whether a currency union can function without a fiscal union , or at least a stronger and more binding fiscal rules ( the maastricht deficit liabilities are too easily violated ) . to this , we need to add coordinated financial regulation and bailout policies as deposits flow rapidly across borders in response to national guarantees and insurance in the eurozone . will the euro ’s second decade really be as successful ?
today , language barriers keep many immigrant parents from making any sort of homework because the texts get only in english . but imagine a world in which textbooks align with many learning styles and translated into myriad languages . today , pluto remains on the planet ’s list in science textbooks , and who knows how long it will take to break free . but imagine a world where textbooks are continually updated and corrected with a legion of contributors . such a world was just a dream a decade ago .
after all , if only they could take their seats in china . one powerful school of thought that emerged almost as early as the killing began in 1989 is that the more radical student 's leaders were reckless . it should have been obvious to them that a violent crackdown was unavoidable . by provoking a regime , students derailed any chance of slow political reform , which their more moderate elders purposed carefully in train . indeed , so the proponents of this school often added , china was not yet ready for democracy .
delivery challenges abound in war zones , but not everywhere . yet international donors are dragging their feet on meeting existing commitments and making new ones . and all of the world ’s aid will not stop the killings . it is too late now for non-military instruments of coercion to have a lot bearing , even though the security council ’s threat of international criminal court prosecutions on atrocity crimes – including any use of chemical weapons – must remain on the table . but what type of military-response options still strongly favored by many policymakers and pundits ?
for example , with trump calling for america ’s reduction of america ’s military involvement in the middle east , he is simply echoed by obama . yet , by repudiating his nuclear deal with iran , trump has been waging war in the region ever more likely . and , by coming out of his way to ease north korea ’s path of international isolation , while gaining almost nothing in return , he has strengthened china ’s standing in east asia . trump ’s global trade war is equally self-defeating . by lamenting tariffs on america ’s ’s ’s ’s closest allies , he is driving them practically into china ’s arms .
every country could devise a council that represents public bodies ( transport , public works , customs ) , and major users ( exporters and logistics companies ) that must work together to identify ways to lower logistics costs . communications between users and government services are vital to achieving any real improvement . it is only as vital , though , for committees to develop along similar lines in each country ’s provincial fields . merchandise need n’t pass through capital , as it does in most latin american and caribbean countries with associated cost increases . regions then may be turned to the engines of growth .
the fdp ’s thinking has broad backing in germany and among german economists ( and sharing a host of other european economists ) . and they are in line with the positions adopted by germany ’s federal ministry of finance under its previous government . but policies that might work in an open world of efficient and resilient financial markets could prove dangerous if applied in highly imperfect real-world markets . just as we saw a decade ago , financial institutions operating in an environment of uncertainty can become fragile and fall , imposing high costs on society . the idea of a temporary euro-exit is especially ill-advised .
will returning to robust growth , or will there be an anemic recovery , à la japan in the 1990 ’s ? right now , i cast my votes on the latter , particularly given that an enormous legacy of debt is likely to supplant enthusiasm for the huge stimulus that is required . without a sufficiently large stimulus ( amounting to more than 2 % of gdp ) , we will face a vicious negative spiral : a weak economy will mean more bankruptcies , pushing down stock prices and interest rates up , undermine consumer confidence , and weaken the banks . consumption and investment are set to shrink further . many wall street financiers who received their gobs of cash go back to their fiscal religions of low deficits .
prague – global free trade provides the single greatest opportunity to advance human well-being in the coming decade and a half . it has already helped lift more than one billion people out of poverty over the last quarter-century . lowering trade barriers even more could dual incomes in some of the world ’s poorest region over the next 15 years . yes , there are the costs of freer trade that must be addressed better ; but the costs are vastly outweighed by benefits . still , in rich countries today , sentiment has turned against free trade .
nevertheless , muslims in sub-saharan africa , like most muslims around the world , exhibit the “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ us versus them ” mentality . ” when muslims form a minority , they have tended to co-exist peacefully with other religions , but where their populations are substantial ( as in nigeria ) tend to assert themselves . whatever the ethnic and other divisions that are at stake , “ american-led versus them ” sentiment has played a great role in fomenting religious conflict in nigeria . nevertheless , nigeria ( and perhaps zanzibar ) remains an exception in islamic assertiveness in sub-saharan africa , making the idea of an active “ islamic world ” encompassing only a relatively limited segment of sub-saharan african muslims . whether they like or not , most sub-saharan african muslims are represented by states that tend to be secular , christian , or dominated by other religions .
indeed , piketty argues that our “ obsession with growth ” is simply “ serving as an excuse for doing nothing about health , education , or redistribution . ” and it is an obsession rooted strongly in the present . “ we forget ” that for centuries , growth was basically zero-sum , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” he writes . “ one per capita real growth implies doubling in size to your economy every 30 or 35 years . piketty sees this as grounds for being somewhat optimistic .
for good reason , many europeans remain sensitive to human-rights issues in hong kong , xinjiang , and elsewhere . europeans , too , are justifiably worried about economic issues . as the european commission warned earlier this year ( under its previous leadership ) , china is a “ economic competitor ” in the pursuit of technological leadership , as well as a systemic rival promoting alternative governance models . this language represents a sharp departure from this past formal eu communiqués . the coming year will be critical .
though the democrats have frequently criticized trump ’s approach , they are not proposing further trade liberalization . a final question to consider when assessing america ’s presidential candidates is whom each would appoint as america ’s next chair of the us federal reserve . trump , who has repeatedly criticized current fed chair jerome powell for pursuing too little monetary-policy easing , would most likely pick up with an dovish candidate . left-leaning democrat might just do the same , given the left ’s fascination with risky ideas that advocate a massive volume of fed-financed debt . center-leftists – biden , amy klobuchar , pete buttigieg – might reappoint powell , who has done fine work or elect a moderate democratic economist such as former fed vice chair alan blinder or former us treasury secretary larry summers .
the boston globe , for example , ran an article by the man – identified only by its first name , danny – whom the brothers carjacked three days after the attacks . danny claimed that the single brothers ' only word ’ conversation that it understood to be “ manhattan , ” ” ” ” ” and that terrorists asked whether his car could leave the state – say , getting to new york . the globe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s one-source report proved nothing – and was unverifiable by other reporters or citizens – but suggested much , leading to the spate of equally unverifiable news that new york had been targeted . other recent “ terror ” “ ” ” ” ” “ related reporting was as flimsy . in charles savage ’s recent account of the guantánamo “ uprising , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” the new york times credulously reproduced the arsenal that gitmo officials showed reporters on a video still .
at the same time , those gains were not equitably distributed , and sub-saharan africa saw far less progress than other areas . a second study , funded by ifad and recently released by the international food policy research institute , examines the worldwide economic downturn starting in 2012 against rural populations . it finds that as a result of the downturn , an estimated 38 million more people will remain in extreme poverty in 2030 than are likely to have otherwise , with farm households in middle-income countries especially at risk . this poses a grave challenge to the poverty-reduction sdgs in all of its forms everywhere , ” ” and reinforces the case for policies and investments that are explicitly targeting rural areas , where poverty-reduction interventions are needed more and will have a greater impact . rural areas of change so far reveals their future potential .
such policies could then be entirely subjugated to demands for the gold standard and for free capital mobility . but , once the political franchise was enlarged , the working class got organized , and mass politics became the norm , domestic economic goals began competing with ( and overwhelm ) outside regulations and constraints . a classic case is britain ’s short-lived return to gold in the interwar period . the attempt to reconstitute the pre-world war i model of globalization collapsed in 1931 , when domestic politics compelled britons to opt for a domestic reflation over the gold standard . the architects of the bretton woods regime kept this lesson in mind once they re-designed the world ’s monetary system in 1944 .
washington , dc – more than 60 % of all employed women in sub-saharan africa go to agricultural labor . yet the region ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s women farmers often reap meager harvests not because of weather or poor soil quality , but because of their gender – or , more fundamentally , due to a dense web of laws , policies , programs , and the customs that place them at a considerable disadvantage . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
beyond the need to ease the human misery that fills the television screens and the front pages of papers , the imperative is not to miss the significant medium-term opportunities that migration provides . while there are pockets of high unemployment today in europe , the ratio of working to the elderly will decline considerably in the longer term . and , already , labor-market flexibility has been undermined by structural inertia , including the difficulty of retooling and retooling workers , particularly the long-term unemployed . as the german government and some corporate leaders , including the ceo of daimler-benz , have already recognized , an open-minded approach to refugee absorption and integration can help cushion some of europe ’s protracted structural challenges . after all , a substantial share of the incoming refugee population is said to be educated , motivated , and committed to building a better future in their new homes .
for example , if an independent worker drives one hour for uber , walking a dog for the next hour ’s rover , each platform would contribute an equal amount toward his or her benefit . doing so would enable independent workers to accumulate and manage their benefits , and eventually acquire safety nets like having full-time contracted employees . with digital commerce having estimated that benefits at least 80 million young africans by 2030 , opportunities for gig workers would grow . and if access to a wide prized benefit , from health insurance to pensions , is made conditional on registering their business and paying taxes , they would have a powerful reason to formalize their work . digitization could enable the formal sector to offer a spectrum of workforce benefits and responsibilities to employers .
for starters , they must take action to protect rural environments , ensure animal welfare , and improve education , knowledge transfers , and entrepreneurship training for farmers and agricultural laborers . british policymakers must also move beyond the ad hoc responses to natural and man-made disasters , by building more efficient and credible protection systems . for example , they could facilitate the provision of affordable insurance for farmers , or establish some kinds of mutual-assistance scheme . implementing ( and funding ) such initiatives will require sustained political will . at the same time , the uk must ensure that its agricultural sector can leapfrog the new technology landscape .
frankfurt – the european central bank is at the center of a large , high-risk experiment . key interest rates have remained near zero for six years now . financial markets are flooded with liquidity , as they have done . crisis management has led to major market distortions , with some segments of everything ’ performance no longer explainable through fundamental economic data . the unintended consequences of this policy become increasingly visible – and will become increasingly tangible with the american federal reserve ’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy .
it is easy to forget that years ago , telephones had no buttons or dial – you had to pick up a handset and ask a operator to make connections . the telephone dial did n’t seem until 1919 , when a first group of self-designated “ user-connected scientists ” at west electric regarded what our most intuitive form should be . when improved a computer interfaces , form is the crucial . we ’ve seen hints at the new paradigm in apple ’s ’s ’s ’s iphone , which enables a gestural finger motions but in the intelligence community , concept visualization can be so radical that most ordinary users might barely recognize what it was . designs are inspired by cognitive sciences , arts , even sciences fiction .
but that , too , is not yet the whole story , either . as plato tells us , prometheus ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s name implies “ foresight ” “ foresight , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” because it invariably looked ahead , unlike its carefree brother , epimetheus , whose very name implies “ “ hindsight ” . as the more rational and justifiably paranoid of the two , prometheus tried to warn his brother ’s failure to embrace zeus in a dangerous gift . but epimetheus was charming a pandora , and heedlessly welcomed it in his lifetime . only later , did he come to realize his terrible mistake .
the chances are that they will do so again . indeed , downplaying the gravity of the latest crisis is simple : one can argue that the immediate cause of the breakdown , when examined closely , does not really all that serious . the crux of the problem is that the draft constitution would give the eu a new and much easier means to take majority votes at the council of ministers . under the method adopted at the nice summit three years ago , every member state has some kind of vote , weighted according to population , but the small countries are protected by having proportionally more votes than the big countries . that system , like the qualified majority , is known for this system .
rome – the prices of many staple foods soared dramatically during 2007-2008 , creating a food crisis for many poor and developing countries alike . indeed , international prices for maize , rice , and wheat , for example , reached their peak in 30 years , generating political and economic instability and fueling food riots in many countries . several factors contributed to the crisis , including soaring oil prices , high demand for crops from the bio-fuels sector , the falling global stockpiles of food commodities , and lower cereal output . robust economic growth and expansionary monetary policies boosted this trend further , as did protectionist measures , such as export restrictions . while these factors undoubtedly placed upward pressure on food prices , they alone can not explain steep hikes .
the similarities with the islamic state ’s views are glaring . in a video produced after the battle for mosul dam in august , the group called for the “ “ end of the sykes-picot ” group , ” ” and proclaimed the need to redraw the middle east ’s western-imposed political map . erdoğan ’s own aspirations to rebuild turkey ’s primacy in the sunni world are driving him to collude with this challenge to the western-devised regional order . indeed , turkey has offered logistical support to the islamic state , even as it has enabled kurdish members to massacre thousands of civilian kurds and the yazidis in the syrian town of kobani on turkey ’s ’s doorstep . this highlights another matter on which turkey and the islamic state converge : the kurds .
so far , it has refrained from claiming outright that these markets act at the behest of “ world jewry ” ( architects , too many turkish islamists trust , of the 1908 young turk revolution of 1908 turk and of the secular republic that arose after world war i ) . but its core supporters hear the dog whistle at its condemnations of finance – forces that now seem to be demanding higher interest rates . but perhaps no current leader is more susceptible to misbed-science and half-baked conspiracy theory than american president and wannabes , donald trump . it should never be forgotten that trump has capitalized his way in us politics by promoting the racist “ birther ” argument that asserted that us then-president barack obama did not give birth to the american people and thus did not qualify for the offices he held . since entering the white house , lunacy has only grown .
at the same time , the us does its utmost to make ukraine attractive to foreign investors . in the energy sector , we are privatizing state-owned energy distributors . in order to ensure full transparency on the tender process , as well as to eliminate problems that exist in the past , western advisors are aiding the us . for our intent , it is to attract large western energy firms with experience in this field as strategic investors . ten leading international energy firms , indeed , will participate in the privatization of the first group of companies .
even so , chinese political choices strongly influence other asia-pacific countries , with china ’s “ state-capitalist capitalist ” economic model , which now mimicked elsewhere in the region . to be sure , japan , korea , and singapore also had similar policy models in the past ( although they later adjusted them in line with their gdp growth ) . now , however , these countries are once again espousing forms of state capitalism and a return to industrial policy ( encouraged in the case of the 2008 global financial meltdown that gave fresh grounds for a return to government interventions ) . in japan , the postal services that were once privatized are to re-become nationalized , boosting the role of government finance . japan ’s near bankrupt lines were rescued by a government bailout , a device that looks increasingly common .
without the ecb ’s current commitment , in place since 2012 , to prevent sovereign-debt yields from soaring , a persistent risk to the eurozone – and , indeed , an entire edifice of europe ’s sovereign-debt defaults . but at least europeans have benefited from falling commodity prices . by contrast , many emerging-market economies , heavily reliant on commodity export earnings , have stressed the commodity-price reset , sluggish growth in developed economies , and slower growth in china . capital flight would materially add to their plight – in some cases , disastrously . since the 2008 financial crisis , the world has become accustomed to such linkages and spillovers .
let the world recall that gaza ’s crisis is manmade catastrophe . and let the world acknowledge that conditions are worse today than at any time since occupation began . seventy-nine percent of gaza ’s households live in poverty ; eight out of ten depend on food aid . nearly half of the labor force is unemployed ; local industries have collapsed . water and wastewater systems fail ; garbage accumulates in the streets .
new york – the european union needs to accept responsibility for the lack of a common asylum policy , one that has transformed this year ’s growing influx of refugees from a manageable problem into yet another political crisis . every member state has selfishly focused on its own concerns , often acting against those of others . this precipitated panic among asylum-seekers , the general public , and the institutions responsible for law and order . asylum-seekers have been their primary victims ; they have been their primary victims ; they have always been unable to overcome them . the eu needs a comprehensive response to the crisis , one that reasserts effective governance over animal flows so that they take their place in a safe , orderly way , and at a pace reflecting europe ’s capacity to absorb them .
the economists would concede that xi ’s campaign has also conveniently eliminated many of his potential rivals . but they would argue that his strengthened position now enables him to substitute for a credit-fueled growth model with something more sustainable . of course , whether they are right about it remains to be seen . despite xi ’s ’s success in consolidating his power and extending his hold on it indefinitely , there is every reason to doubt that he would be willing to risk a new economic model if sustainability proves incompatible with sustaining rapid growth . this is where the technologists originate in , by offering new ways to correct or avoiding potential mistakes .
the american economist martin feldstein wrote in 1997 that the monetary union would create pan-european conflicts . at that time , he was derided and viewed as an entrenched challenger to the european project . unfortunately , his insights were correct today : european countries back in loggerheads not in spite of the common currency , but precisely because of it . history suggests that international disputes over debt and transfer constitute a grave danger . in the 1920 ’s and the 1930 ’s , representatives of european states devoted countless meetings to resolving them ( at a time primarily german-reparations ) .
whereas a key distinction in nineteen eighty-four is between rulers and ruled , in a brave new world , people are divided into separate social orders defined by disparate tastes and lifestyles . the same could be said for china today , where the gaps between rich and poor , urban and rural populations and coastal and inland cultures are so large that it is far harder than before people from a diverse life walks to feel that they share common plights and targets . to be sure , no single novel provides a perfect lens through which to view any society . occasionally , such as when violence was recently used to quell south chinese peasants protesting official land grabs , the ccp still demonstrates its willingness to apply “ boot-on-the-face ” ” suppression . still , there have been more moments lately that favor huxley ’s vision of a political order over that of orwell .
here , too , there are similar trends across many european countries , particularly in southern europe . this suggests that progressive politicians who envisage an active government role in reshaping economic opportunities face an uphill battle in winning over voters . fears of losing this battle may explain timidity about the left 's reaction . yet the lesson from recent studies is that beliefs about what a government can and should do are not immutable . they are susceptible to persuasion , experiences , and changing circumstances .
copenhagen – in one of its first-ever public-policy pronouncements as america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s president-elect , barack obama has focused attention on climate change and clearly stated both his own priorities and the facts on which those priorities rest . sadly , both seem to be weak or even wrong . obama ’s ’s ’s ’s policy-outline was presented via videos to california governor arnold schwarzenegger ’s governorships ’ governorates , and has again been shown in poznan , poland , to the leaders assembled to flesh out the roadmap of global warming . according to obama , the few challenges facing america and the world seem to be more pressing than the fight against climate change . such pronouncements are now commonplace for most political leaders around the world , despite ignoring the question of how much we could do to help america and the world through climate policies versus other policies .
before the creation of an overseas empire – first in north america and the caribbean , then in india and southeast asia – the english built a land empire by expanding from the south of the british isles to the northwest . thus , while the “ outer empire ” allowed for convergence in the uk ’s various national identity around a shared british identity , “ an inner empire ” was decidedly english . still , for centuries , the british empire generated wealth , supplied raw material , and created globe-spanning professional opportunities for all inhabitants of britain ’s isles . its “ civilizing ” mission created a sense of collective purpose , as did the narrative of uninterrupted democratic and economic progress . but the fusion of identity was always incomplete , not least in ireland , where the fallout from independence still reverberates a century later through the insecurity generated by the northern irish “ backstop ” .
free speech and other forms of fundamental rights are not elitist luxuries , as authoritarians claim . they are indispensable to safeguarding free societies . moreover , a concerted anti-corruption campaign could serve as a unifying force in countries with deep political divisions . while a majoritarian administration may ride roughshod over minority interests , corrupt regimes are stealing from all . this is one reason why corruption sparked mass protests from bucharest to brasilia over the last year .
trump ’s ’s geopolitical and economic insights should be put on trial against this backdrop of disenchantment , rather than an ideal of moral or economic standards . in other words , trumpism might be the solution to the liberalism crisis , rather than the portent of its disintegration . viewed in this way , trump ’s ’s isolationism is a populist way to say that america needs pulling back from the commitments it has neither strength nor a willingness to honor . the promise to work with russia to bring an end to an savage conflict in syria is reasonable , though it implies the victory of bashar al-assad ’s regime . disengaging peacefully from exposed global responsibilities will be trump ’s greatest challenge .
madrid – back in 1996 , binyamin netanyahu won a general election by mobilizing large constituencies against the then-prime minister shimon peres ’s purported intention to “ partition jerusalem . ” almost two decades later , netanyahu remains committed to the old , vacuous slogans about a “ united jerusalem ” – a conviction that might yet again unravel the israel-palestine peace process . as us secretary of state john kerry prepares to present the framework convention for a conclusive round of israeli-palestinian peace negotiations , netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s hardline stance on jerusalem is simply a non-starter . in his last-ditch effort to improve his proposal ’s chances of success , us president barack obama – who had largely avoided assuming a proactive role in the israeli-palestinian peace process during his second term – met with netanyahu in the white house in order to urge him to moderate his positions . but transforming netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s mind will not easily – not least because of the domestic political pressures he faces will .
new haven – the year ’s closing day marked the beginning of yet another futile policymaking season by two of the world ’s big central banks – the american federal reserve and the bank of japan . the fed did nothing , which is precisely the problem . and the alchemists at the boj have unveiled yet another feeble unconventional unconventional policy gambit . both the fed and the boj are pursuing strategies that are woefully disconnected from the economies they have been envested to administer . moreover , their latest moves reinforce a deepening commitment to an increasingly insidious transmission mechanism between monetary policy , financial-market , and asset-dependent economies .
today , in a strategic environment marked by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , russia stands a high part of the solution . unless the prague summit passes any grand new initiative , it is simply because we already initiated the new nato-russia relationship last may at our special summit in rome . the new nato-russia council , created in rome , offered us an effective and flexible mechanism for common analysis , common decision-making , and even joint action . much has already been accomplished over the last six months to turn rome ’s political message into practical collaboration . it was henry kissinger , who argued following the terrorist attacks on new york and washington of 2001 that the tragedy could turn into opportunity .
to the outside world , suleimani was the mastermind of the regime ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s terrorist activities outside iran , as well as a puppet of its proxies throughout the region , not least hezbollah in lebanon . still , to iranians , he was an even more complicated figure . while regime hardliners viewed him as a hero , many iranians , who had lost loved ones in peaceful demonstrations , or who oppose the regime ’s attacks against iranian dissidents in the diaspora , saw him otherwise . nonetheless , over the last few years , the regime has pushed the shrewd public-relations campaign to depict suleimani as napoleon – or caesar-like warrior-poet . and , as one of the few islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) commanders not tainted with corruption allegations , he was mooted as a likely presidential candidate in the coming elections .
yet it also wants to boost an economy with a € 50 billion ( $ 55 billion ) stimulus package and expand the welfare state . to square the circle , macron needs growth and relies on supply-side reforms to deliver it . he plans to cut the corporate-tax rate from 33 % to 25 % , and to exclude financial investment from wealth taxation . a vocal critic of protectionism would press the eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreements , and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the united states . his backing the el khomri law , making it easy to fire workers and his opposition to the 35-hour workweek , denounces his desire to make the french labor market more competitive .
prague : many americans seem overdrawn by the feeling that because the soviet empire was collapsing , the dangers of war can be crossed by a list of potential risks . america , they say , should pay attention to its own problems and should not get involved in a world in which its attempts to do good are rewarded with ingratitude . isolationism has a long tradition in america ; it returns in fits and differing forms . never in modern times has isolationism protected america from dangers ; instead delayed engagement when conflagrations turn out to be ablaze . in the end , america is paying a thousandth of times as much for its initial lack of interest than it could pay ever pay to become engaged at the start of crisis , or better yet in the past .
here , too , a creative solution can be found . using the asset-backed security model , we recently joined with the un ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s green climate fund and china to structure a $ 450 million “ green bond ” facility . this will enable pension funds and insurers to fund precisely the necessary facilities upgrades in mom-and-pop shops and workshops , from tijuana to tierra del fuego . there are many other areas , where those committed to fighting climate change may follow our example . traffic-clogged cities need better public transportation , and funding an extension of bus rapid transit ( brt ) systems is a proven way to limit congestion , emissions , and commuting costs .
once again , eurobonds , a green partnership with china , and unity within europe could make all the difference . such an alliance would also allow for a new european foreign policy , one promoting peace and sustainable development , underpinned by a new security guarantee that does not depend so heavily on america . europe , a magnet for hundreds of millions of would-be economic migrants , could , should , and i believe , regain control of its borders , allow it to strengthen and enforce necessary limits on migration . the political terms of a grand coalition government would seem obvious . the spd should hold out for ministerial leadership on economic and financial policies , while the cdu/csu holds the baggage of inclinations .
fortunately , that is precisely what abe plans to do . at any rate , the success of monetary policy is hard to deny . as the deflation gap narrows , however , the total impact on monetary policy will wane , as it increasingly influences prices more than output . that is why the time has come for japan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders to shift their focus from the demand-focused first and second arrows to the supply-oriented third arrow : the new growth strategy . when enough excess supply exists in the us economy , promoting supply-side productivity is practically useless without demand-boosting efforts .
race has always been a provocative subject when the need for science and our statistics intersect with politics . now that the debate is heating up again in france , because the planned introduction of “ “ ethnic statistics ” created a fierce dispute that touches the very heart of french republicanism . under a law that dates back to the french revolution and reconfirm in 1978 , french government officials are forbidden in collecting information on a citizen ’s own ethnic or racial origins , both genuine or perhaps also allegedly , when conducted a census or other effort to gather statistical information about populations . there are two major reasons for this , but not all . the former is the republican principle , enshrined in a constitution that recognizes only citizens and accepts any distinction between them due to origin , race , or religion .
no one prefers living in a society in which bribes must be paid to secure basic public services like health care and education . eliminating corruption will be possible only with an effective mix of clever prevention strategies and robust enforcement strategies , underpinned by a belief that greed can be unlearned , accountability can teach , and impunity can end . prevention should start with education aimed at boosting citizens ’ expectations . in both politics and entrepreneurship , integrity and accountability must be the rule , not the exception . knowledge-sharing across countries could illuminate the most effective strategies for achieving this goal .
in these countries , ministers are being forced to resign over petty infractions that would seem trivial in other countries as well . compelling american , russian , nigerian , or chinese citizens who suffer from corruption might indeed seem like a futile task . but the goal certainly stands to evoke , for the evidence is overwhelming : impunity does not just be morally noxious ; it is also economically costly and deeply corrosive of well-being . recent studies have shown that when “ generalized trust ” in a society is high , economic performance improves and life satisfaction rises . commercial agreements are more readily achievable and effectively implemented .
as they put it , putting the use of fiscal adrenaline could be limited just when it is needed most . there is an urgent need for reining in the emergency arsenal , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” when there is relatively little scope for relax monetary policy . the fed has started a process of normalizing monetary policy , but it has failed to finish the job , and president donald trump does what he can to avoid , by heckling from the sidelines . the three musketeers remain positive about some elements of a post-crisis program . bank capital has been greatly strengthened , while making the transparency of derivatives markets effective .
human rights need not take a back seat to do business with china . as a case in point , many western observers thought that norway ’s trade relationship with china would be undermined when the dissident liu xiaobo was invited to receive the nobel peace prize in december 2010 . china complained loudly , refused to allow liu to pick up the prize , and even threatened norway with financial repercussions . the same month , by contrast , one of china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largest oil companies concluded drilling deals with norway ’s statoil , clearly signaling that diplomatic tensions would not stop doing business . so western diplomats negotiating with china should call lower-level officials a high level of bluff and focus on the signal-to-noise ratio , bearing in mind that , ultimately , decisions are conducted softly at the height of pragmatic leaders indeed susceptible to pressure .
that said , the system ’s focus must shift from a speculative , proprietary trading to lending and job creation to one that entails reform of financial-sector regulation and an antitrust and corporate-governance law coupled with adequate enforcement to ensure that markets do not become rigged in casinos . after all , globalization has made all countries more interdependent , in turn demanding more global cooperation . we might hopeon that america would show more leadership to reforming the global financial system by advocating for stronger international regulation , a global reserve system , and better ways to restructure its sovereign debt ; address global warming ; and provide aid to poorer countries . americans should hope for all of this , although i am not sanguine about getting a lot of it . & on getting a lot of it right now , americans should muddle through – here ’s another small program for struggling students and homeowners , an end to bush ’s tax cuts for millionaires but no wholesale tax reform , serious cutbacks in us defense spending , or any meaningful progress on global warming . with the euro crisis likely still unabated , america ’s continuing malaise does not bode well for global growth .
that issue , of course , is entirely outside israel ’s control . an ongoing struggle in the muslim world between sunnis and the shi’a recalls the struggle between protestants and catholics in seventeenth-century europe . little wonder , then , that the saudis , jordanians , egyptians , and the gulf states are bent on resisting iran ’s ’s hegemonic ambitions in the region . nevertheless , the stakes are far higher than at the turn of the seventeenth century , for iran represents a threat that combines fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons . indeed , iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another un member .
the strategic significance of the dramatic heights , overlooking most of the north israeli region of galilee , is obvious . because syria , bereft of soviet aid , is less of an existential threat to israel , jerusalem may be more elastic than before , when the golan was a glacis defending israel not only against syria , but against a bloc seemingly stretching all the way to vladivostok . so , despite today ’s interruptions , a context for negotiations exists , as do the political will on both sides . nonetheless , both parties ’ agendas are different : whereas syria focuses on the symbolic meaning of the golan ’s return , israel wants specific , entrenched safeguards regarding the safety of its northeastern border , as well as the cessation of syrian-supported hizbullah incursions from lebanon – a country that is practically a syrian protectorate . for israel to return the golan is no part of paper with normal platitudes about peace and coexistence .
in the fall of 1989 , east german troops joined with their fellow citizens in the protests that brought down the berlin wall . during the same year in china , however , the protesters in beijing were crushed by troops from inner mongolia , who failed to understand mandarin , and had little sympathy for big-city dwellers . whereas army units or riot squads ( omon ) stationed in moscow are overly disgruntled recent police and military reform to engage in bloody clampdown , special-operation force forces from the provinces , staffed with chechen veterans , might cherish the excitement of sticking it to moscow fat cats . likewise , army officers from poorer regions are more grateful for the wage hike announced by putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s united russia party , with much fanfare , shortly before the recent duma elections . but , while some parts of the security apparatus might have supported an initial crackdown , violent repression would have been hard to sustain .
but not fitting would have been a disaster , too . the crisis of 1992 turned out to be an unstable proposition of today ’s system . not moving forward with the euro would have set europe for even more disruptive crises . this is why europe ’s leaders have taken the ambitious steps that they have done . not proceeding now with bank recapitalization and government bond purchases would similarly lead to catastrophe .
america , of course , argues that it , too , knows all about democracy . but its diplomatic cognitive dissonance criticizing the egyptian regime , while continuing to supply it with military hardware , may serve only to undermine the bilateral relationship , just as the same american approach to musharraf has thoroughly eroded us-pakistani ties . moreover , the consequences of such foreign-policy waffling extend far beyond the middle east . in november 2009 , after obama visited japan for the first time as us president , he stressed that he was from hawaii and proud to be “ american ’ first pacific president . ” two years later , then-secretary of state hillary clinton released “ the americas in the pacific century ” ” ” ” ” indicating a shift in america ’s global strategy .
mr. bush 's international credibility , they should emphasize , does not suffer through avoiding a war but gains further through mastering iraq 's hitherto covert military effort . to give additional credence to their praise , they should leave no doubt that if war were to become america 's only option . at the same time , however , they should underscore that war is not the only , and certainly not the automatic “ grave consequences ” that follow from the iraq non-compliance . to be sure , some of america 's allies are better suited than others to get these points all across an audience on the other side of the atlantic . alas , germany 's government , through its conduct in chancellor schroeder 's campaign for reelection last september , has maneuvered itself off from having any authority on the issue .
africa ’s ’s ’s ’s small family-owned farmers – already burdened by soil degradation , climate change , and resource competition fueled by surging populations – confront an even tougher bureaucratic hurdle : no paper to show that the land they call home is theirs . insecure about their farms ’ ability to make control over their farms over the coming season , farmers ’ ’ planning horizons shrink . rather than invest in terraced fields , planting trees , and purchasing high-quality fertilizers , africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s farmers are seeking to maximize short-term gains . this is particularly true of female farmers , who face an additional thicket of discriminatory land laws and customs . studies show that there is no path to reducing poverty , improving nutrition , or achieving other key development goals without strengthening land rights , particularly for women .
my view is that germany would be better off in ten ten years under more neo-liberal policies . but this does not seem to be what germany 's electorate wants , and this makes the complexion of german politics four years from now incalculable . coupled with all this is northern european discontent with central bankers , specifically with the ecb and the euro . it is not that the end of the european monetary union is on the agenda ; it is only that people began thinking of potentially low probability futures when the end of emu might be placed on the agenda . that is enough to shake asset prices globally .
its organizers , of course , are loath to describe it as a sunni party . rather , it is described as a national party inviting people of all orientations to participate . that vision has great appeal among those who wish to see a less sectarian-based form of politics in iraq . but , within iraq , there are very few people – sunni or shia – who see no view iraqiyya as a party dedicated to restoring sunni leadership . the results of march 2010 general election gave iraqiyya 91 parliamentary seats , two more than nestor finisher , maliki ’s state of law-enforcement coalition .
but many are “ zombie banks , ” ” ” ” with too many branches , too few deposits , and financing costs far exceeding those of their more successful peers . indeed , according to the international monetary fund , some one-third of europe ’s ’s ’s banking sector , representing assets worth an estimated $ 8.5 trillion , remains weak and unable to generate sustainable profits . all of this generates significant downside risks for the eu economy , and , ultimately , europe ’s entire political experiment . restoring stability in europe ’s banking system by the imf ’s own estimates that at least one-third of european banks will require closing or mergers . for the deutsche bank , market speculators already seem anticipating mergers like the commerzbank , another german institution .
they should take specific care to avoid a real-estate bubble , because real estate constitutes an enormous amount of overall wealth and a vital source of collateral in finance . but the strong rise of low quality leveraged loans should also worry . none of this will be readily available for governments , regulators , or central banks . monetary tightening can temporarily slow growth ; prevent bubble-driven growth is notoriously difficult ; and the types of structural reform needed to secure a shift away from debt-fueled growth hardly seem popular . today , ’s febrile political environments surely will not streamline matters .
so it might well be a good idea for the eu to prepare a mechanism that spells out how debt can be retoyed . many economists argued this case against the arithmetic calculus . but the european central bank , notably by ecb governing council member lorenzo bini smaghi , had elegantly spelled out the case against reducing debt – a case that is both politically momentous and profoundly moral . indeed , the principle of not reneging on public debt is deeply ingrained with the evolving capacity of legal certainty , representative governments , and a modern democracy . in the wake of the lavish 1688 revolution , when britain revolted against the spendthrift stuart dynasty , the british government adopted a new debt-reduction approach .
in fact , some conservative republicans object to another of their appointments , j.p. mellon university ’s goodfriend of daring to suggest that the fed might need a fresh approach to monetary policy ( negative-interest rates ) to confront the next very deep recession or financial crisis . and , though someday , the fed will almost surely embrace this advice ( i have also published on the topic ) , fareed goodfriend ’s nomination barely survived the american senate banking committee . but , by and large , the us senate gave trump what he wants , and many republican colleagues would have embraced a disrupter – for example , the disciple of ron “ end the fed ” paul – or another conservative preaching a return to the pre-world war i gold standard . sadly , the battle for the fed ’s independence is far from complete . trump may just keep his powder dry until a true conflict erupts .
yet india continues to face many challenges : almost 300 million people living in poverty ; the spread of the naxalite rebellion ; the risk of terrorist attacks ala mumbai ; and the sprawling urban slums . moreover , how will singh balance the trade-off between pro-market and pro-poor policies ? how will he manage a rising middle class ’s hopes for improved infrastructure , expanded access to healthcare and education ; uninterrupted electricity and water supply ; and more efficient transportation facilities ? these problems will not be solved overnight . but the mounting conviction that tomorrow will make india ’s polity stable .
empirically , few firms get this right : american ’s national public-radio service , and the bbc have both recently been hacked by sea , while mcdonald ’s ’s ’s ’s and burger king recently had its twitter accounts compromised . the proliferation of security lapses means that people are more likely to shrug their shoulders than to put a first-stone at a company that is being violated . finally , aqap is not likely to face financial penalties for this mistake . a lawsuit regarding the losses stemming from a hoaxed tweet would confront near-insurmountable obstacles . because few mechanisms can block proliferation of thuggish tweets , and in light of high-profile reactions that successful hackers may expect , twitter will remain a malicious hoaxes vehicle , even as technology barriers force attacks on a larger scale .
detection means determining whether an extreme event is part of usual weather-related fluctuations or a symptom of a deeper , long-term change . attribution implies that the ability to assign the likely causes of the event to human activity or other factors . a new science of detection and attribution stifles our knowledge – and also gives us an even greater cause for concern . several previous year studies have shown that scientists can indeed detect long-term climate change amid the rising frequency of extreme events – such as heat waves , heavy rains , severe droughts , and powerful storms – in the process . by using cutting-edge climate models , scientists are not only detecting long-term climate change ; it is also attributing at least some extreme events to human causes .
the mutual assessment process on which the g-20 countries have agreed is a crucial ingredient of a rebalancing program , for it is where the pieces of a cooperative growth strategy will be identified , evaluated , and assembled . if it works , what will emerge will be pledges by g-20 countries to commit policies that are globally beneficial on the condition that others hold onto their pledges . america can reduce its deficits at a faster pace than it would in the non-cooperative case , but only as long as surplus countries work to shrink their excess savings . rebalancing is not the only cooperative imperative . the international exchange-rate system , at least partly , is broken .
given the strength of big tech firms to fend off competition , reversing these trends will require government intervention . and , indeed , taming big tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the united states . notably , us senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have shown , in my opinion , the two strongest candidates vying for the democratic party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nomination to challenge us president donald trump – have been calling for breaking up big tech firms . but the solutions that have been proposed , including by legal scholars like hina khan , have tended to focus on making better use of antitrust laws . this approach is unlikely to work , because markets have changed dramatically since antitrust laws were conceived .
throughout my field visit , i marveled at how these efforts affect women ’s ’s ’s ’s lives . on one recent trip , i met with rasmata , a young mother telling me that , through the safety net of her savings group , she managed to encourage her family despite her husband ’s emigration abroad , her father ’s recent deaths , and lingering droughts . she was diversifying her income , managing her finances , and even adopting climate-clever farming techniques . the best part was that she described herself as hard-headed , deferential , rigorous , and ambitious woman . those are adjectives that women everywhere , regardless of their financial circumstances or education , deserve to ascribe to themselves .
when you are a prudent and prudent investor , contemplate this possibility for a while . stock values in the fossil-fuel industry – which relies on the assumption that companies will extract and burn all known reserves – plummet . investing in these companies turns out to be extraordinarily risky . as anyone who receives investment statements knows well , “ past performance ” is no guarantee of future performance . that reality implies another compelling case for divestment .
only by the late 1970s and the 1980s had it become obvious that the soviet system could not compete with market capitalism . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the subsequent soviet collapse that gave way to the g1 +n order , in which all other countries ( bill ) became unable to rival america as the sole global superpower . the ensuing quarter-century was the era of liberal rules-based multilateralism . democratic and market-based capitalism had seemingly triumphed in what francis fukuyama famously called “ the end of history . ” the u.k. broadly championed such a order – the iraq war of 2003 being a clear exception – and , like most countries , benefited enormously from globalization and the emergence of new , complicated value chains .
instead , after four years of falling real incomes , the government has announced deeply unpopular pension reforms , which included increases in retirement ages . resolving russia ’s study of economic grievances will not be easy . russia ’s economy is under severe strain due to western sanctions over crimea . more important , russia ’s state-capitalist model has led to weak competition and declining incentives for private-sector investment and entrepreneurship . with few rallying possibilities for public sentiment , putin may well decide that it is time to remind ” russians that he is under assault .
first , eu member states say that they want to develop a common european foreign policy . at maastricht in 1991 they established new institutions for doing just that ; at amsterdam last year , they ostensibly strengthen those institutions . yet , in practice , there has been no detectable progress in practice . this stands in stark contrast to other aspects of the european union ’s agenda . the targets for economic and monetary union and the single currency that were adopted at maastricht in 1991 are courageous , even a revolutionary agenda ; some critics say reckless ; but the reality is that the single currency will play a reality in just two months ’ time .
but broad international support will not come forward where military operations are perceived as some form of western neo-imperialism . this last point has stood at the heart of the problems in iraq . augmenting us and british troops with other “ western ” powers would not , particularly at this late stage , change a crucial perception of that intervention , both in and outside of the arab world , change . only an explicit , up-front approval of a reformed un security council can ensure the legitimacy and international support that military action – except for clear self-defense – demands . this applies to the actions contemplated by individual nations , temporary alliances , or more lasting alliances , such as nato .
this regional re-alignment needs not necessarily anti-western , but it surely will if israel and/or the united states attack iran militarily . meanwhile , a civil war rages in syria is raging , accompanied by a humanitarian disaster . to be sure , syrian president bashar al-assad ’s ’s regime will not survive , but it is determined to fight until the end . syria ’s ’s balkanization among the country ’s ’s ’s diverse ethnic and religious groups represents a clear predictable outcome . indeed , bosnia-type scenario can no longer be ruled out , while the prospect of a syrian government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s loss of control of its chemical weapons poses an imminent threat to turkey ’s military intervention , israel , or the us .
in newsrooms from serbia to south africa , taxpayer-generated financing tends to grow . unfortunately , while this windfall might place more programming on the air , only deepening the industry ’s woes . governments have played a major role in domestic media for decades , taking advantage of broadcast frequencies and licensing requirements to shape markets . yet , in recent years , governments have also stepped up their budget influence . today , government budget allocations are among the leading sources of media revenues .
new york – the concept of humanitarian intervention following the genocide in rwanda and the balkan wars of the 1990 ’s was the order of the day . as a result , international law came to recognize the “ “ right of protection ” against the governmental arbitrariness and states of crimes against their own people , even as enforcement remains quite precarious . finally , similar trends in politics and international law led to the establishment of an international tribunal for the international court of justice . with its establishment , resulting from a long and horrible experience , the fundamental idea of modernity – that the strength of states and their rulers should be subject to the rule of law , thereby placing individual rights above state sovereignty – took a giant step forward . this development was anything but accidental , but it was not .
axelrod holds tournaments among leading theorists and political scientists to identify the most efficient approach in a prisoner ’s repeat play ’s dilemma . the victor – a strategy most likely producing a cooperative outcome – was an anatol rapoport ’s tit-for-tat ( tft ) strategy . according to the tft approach , a bilateral game should start with collaboration : if another player behaves cooperatively , so should you . only if another player ’s flaws – that is , comes to view an non-cooperative behaviors – should you do the same . of course , when a second player cooperates , it might be tempting for a defect , in order to maximize one ’s own payoff and potentially even make a windfall .
as for the right threat from the right , anyone hopes for peace in the region and reduces tensions within india among religious communities are being relieved by the defeat of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) . the bjp ’s strategy of painting the us congress as its soft on terror and demonizing muslims as an existential threat to india badly misfired . unfortunately , however , the economic trajectory that the us congress is feeling , though it may well boost growth in the short term is ultimately on a collision course with both equity and sustainability . notwithstanding rhetoric about “ inclusive growth , ” india ’s wealth gap has widened during the years of exceptionally rapid economic expansion . most of the rest of the world ’s malnourished children live in india .
but it is fairly obvious that , even during the 1860s , there was little empirical evidence in supporting friedman ’s ideas in order to justify his rising dominance . and , indeed , there can be no denying the fact that friedman ’s cure proved to be an inadequate response to the great recession – strongly suggesting that it would have collapsed similarly short had it been tried during the great depression . friedman ’s dominance at the start of the great recession had less to do with the evidence supporting them than because the science of economics was all too often tainted by politics . in that case , the contamination was so bad that policymakers were reluctant to go beyond friedman to apply keynesian and minskyite policies on a massive enough scale to deal with the problems presented by the great recession . admitting that the monetarist cure was inadequate would have required mainstream economists to swim against the neoliberal currents of our age .
berlin – ever since the global financial crisis erupted in september 2008 , the european union has been at a time of turmoil . on the one hand , europe has protected the eurozone , particularly germany ’s export-driven economies , from speculative attacks and disorder to currency volatility . on the other hand , the second stage of the crisis mercilessly exposed europe ’s ’s ’s achilles ’ achilles ’ heel : the absence of economic or financial unification within the eurozone . rising tensions within the eu have , on the whole , been the inevitable outcome . germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s actions throughout the crisis have been plainly at odds with each other .
after all , the repressive nature of the regime in khartoum is at the root of the multiple conflicts plaguing the country apart . if the government in khartoum persists in undermining the reform process , and derailing a referendum on self-determination promised for the south in january 2011 , a return to full-scale civil war , with calamitous repercussions for sudan and all parts of the region , presents a real possibility . sudan ’s commitment to the cpa has always been equivocal . indeed , since ending the civil war in 2005 , the people of sudan ’s liberation army ( spla ) in the south have frequently been forced to confront militias operating as government-imposed proxies . moreover , sudanese security forces continue to arm arab tribes straddling the north-south border with the goal of destabilizing the predominantly christian south .
( hydroelectric power generation emits no co2 , but there are only a few remaining places in a world where it can be scaled up without major environmental or social costs . ) a second solution is to capture co2 emissions for storage underground . but this technology , called carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) , is not yet proven on a massive scale . one approach is to capture co2 at a power plant as coal or gas is burned . another is to capture it directly from the air using specially designed chemical processes .
in the post-crisis financial order , governments need to take on the role of surveillance and regulation in financial firms ; otherwise , the perverse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily recur . it is important to distinguish between the two sources of concern for pay in financial firms . one set of concerns arises from the perspectives of shareholders . figures recently released by the new york times ’s attorney general , andrew cuomo , indicate that nine large financial firms were paying their employees aggregate compensation above $ 600 billion between 2003 and 2008 , a period in which their aggregate market capitalization declined substantially . such patterns can raise concerns among shareholders that pay structures are poorly designed to serve their interests .
such manufactured even-handedness is tantamount to “ fake news . ” it is time to call a spade a spade : the republican party is overwhelmingly accountable . consider the issue of “ bump stock , ” ” ” ” gun modification that the culprit of the las vegas massacre used to fire at a faster pace . some republican senators have now drawn praise for indicating that they would endorse the facility ’s ban . but , when democratic us senator dianne feinstein proposed a similar ban in 2013 , republicans overwhelmingly opposed it .
by 2000 , that share had fallen to 22 % , and by 2010 , to just 11 % , with slightly more than 3 % living at outright destitution . chile today is very different from the chile of 20 years ago . with its new aspirations and targets , the country ’s 29 % population that left poverty behind , the region is now the world ’s incipient middle class , with its new aspirations and goals . as a result , demands for more opportunity and improved living conditions have grown louder . chileans are clamoring for adequate housing , access to improved health services , safer environments , and access to higher education – all the more critical factor underlying social advancement .
clinton is the only person known to have initiated her campaign twice . ( a first attempt , in iowa , where she spoke with some eight people in the closed sessions , did n’t work very well . ) this impressive , remarkably smart woman simply does n’t have a feeling on politics that is being demanded at the top . success in america ’s presidential politics requires superb intuitions , parfit fast on a single legs , and , more importantly , a compelling rationale for running . true , clinton is offering multiple programs that she would press as president ; but , to borrow from winston churchill , there is no theme in her pudding .
only a year ago , at the imf ’s annual meeting in washington , dc , did senior staff tell anyone to listen that an entire european sovereign-debt panic was a tempest in a teapot . using slick powerpoint presentations with titles like “ default ” in today ’s advanced economies : pointless , undesirable , and unlikely , the fund sought to persuade investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock . even for greece , the imf argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , owing to expectations of growth and reform . never mind the obvious flaw in the fund ’s rationale , namely that countries like greece and portugal are facing policy and performance risks far more similar to those of emerging markets than to truly advanced economies like germany and the united states . as matters deteriorated , one might have guessed it that the imf would mark its own beliefs about the market as it was , adopting a more cautious tone .
another alternative , backed by a huge and growing body of research into economics and psychology , takes a direct measure of well-being or happiness . surveys of reported well-being are now available for many countries , and the idea of slashing to send it through that as the metric for prosperity had strong proponents . but that option has several drawbacks , including by allowing disparate indicators of well-being to change little over time . happiness surveys in rich countries , for example , typically show a score of six or seven on a 0-10 scale . one way to make such indicators more directly relevant to policy would be to track the ways people use their time and attach well-being measures to each .
if it were the metric , then , despite its accomplishments , thatcherism turned out to be a failure . the shift toward finance that thatcher promoted heightened inequality , making the economy even more volatile . her “ right ” to buy ” ” ” ” policy triggered an upward spiral in house prices , thereby encouraging households to take on more and more debt . the “ big bang ” ” ” ” ” of 1986 , which de-regulated financial services made risky behavior at the urban norm . such reforms sowed the seeds of the 2008 financial crisis .
yes , the imf maintains an impressive analytical edge , owing to its talented and dedicated staff , as well as its unique linkages to countries . yes , it has made important strides toward improving its understanding of the relationship between financial markets and the real economy . and , yes , it has valiantly taken the lead in shining more light on the economic implications of gender inequalities and climate change . but its forward-thinking analyses have all too often turned backward , with its own quantitative projections having consistently subjected substantial revisions . even more worryingly , the fund ’s policy recommendations – particularly those pertaining to the advanced economies – have little impact ( to put it bluntly ) .
this is particularly necessary because the circumstances of women are one key benchmarks that the outside world , and particularly the west , uses to evaluate the arab world . and , unfortunately , such assessments tend to focus on the sdgs that derives from islamic norms that obscures the knowledge of the real changes taking place . indeed , the predominant view of arab societies often stifles outsiders ’ ability to break free of their belief that islam confines all arab women to the same level at a time when in reality they experience very different terms . this precludes many from seeing , much less assess , deep shifts taking place within arab societies – and how women drive those changes forward . the west thus risks depriving itself of an important key key to understanding the arab world today and , like tomorrow , that will exist .
in a lone mob , the american sociologist david riesman identified three broad cultural species : tradition-directed cultures that seek to inherited rituals , morals , and guidance values ; inner-directed cultures in which people behave according to self-nourished values ; and other-directed cultures that react predominantly to outside norms and peer influences . riesman ’s framework has specific resonance in the arab world these days , where rising literacy rates and quick advances in communications technology stirred a maelstrom of competing cultural narratives , with his three types competing to define the region ’s future . ironically , it is the combination of elevated literacy and modern technology , fanning the flames of conflict between the two kinds of “ “ reformers ” – a – – religious revivalists and western-oriented modernizers . taking advantage of their ability to massachusetts and instantly disseminate ancient religious texts and western-originating literature , both camps are fighting for the hearts and minds of otherwise traditional societies . according to the lebanese publisher samar abou-zeid , however , religious books are among the most downloaded works of literature in the arab world .
until recently , there was very little reason to question this question . china ’s ’s ’s economy was growing at an astounding average annual rate of 10 % or higher for more than three decades . china overtook japan as the world ’s second-largest economy in the world . hundreds of millions of chinese entered the middle class , with much of it . china ’s model of authoritarian efficiency seemed appealing to many other developing countries , particularly in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis , which began in the united states , and appeared to discredit american-style liberal capitalism .
after that , the u.s. established permanent normal trade relationships with china , and refused to brand its government a currency manipulator . the reason that this narrative is wrong is straightforward . there are good reasons why america adopted policies that encouraged poorer countries to grow rapidly through export-led industrialization . in helping mexico , brazil , and other developing countries grow , america gains richer trade partners . moreover , there is a strong case for improving american national security if 50 years from now , schoolchildren around the world learn how america helped their countries prosper , rather than try to contain them as poor as they could be .
but it is an open question whether an still highly fragmented digital-payment sector will help customers more than those companies offer pay-for-success solutions . there is one more central problem with the arguments for a catherine company : most people , at least within the eurozone , do n’t want it . according to an as-yet-unpublished european central bank study of 65,000 eurozone residents , nearly 80 % of all point-of-sale transactions are conducted in monetary terms ; and more than half of all payments come from cash . as is often the case in europe , variations among member states are voiced : the share of monetary transactions ranges from 42 % in finland to 92 % in malta . but , overall , the public ’s commitment to monetary affairs remains strong – and becomes stronger .
tel aviv – the crisis in the sinai peninsula appears to have crept dwarfed by sunday ’s drama in cairo . yet egyptian president mohamed morsi ’s civilian coup , in which he dismissed general mohamed hussein tantawi , the leader of the army ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s supreme command , has done nothing to lessen the significance of the trouble there . earlier this month , jihadi terrorists ambushed an egyptian military base in sinai , killing 16 egyptian soldiers . then , they hijacked two armored personnel carriers , and sped their way to the frontier with israel . one vehicle failed to break through the border crossings ; further intruded israeli territory before being halted by israel ’s self-defense forces ( idf ) .
but , as countries that rely largely on active diplomacy and soft power , they have everything to lose from an extended and escalating geopolitical conflict in which they would come under pressure to choose sides . to defend their own interests , they must ensure that global trade is free from targeted dispute-settlement mechanisms . a commitment to multilateralism is not an endorsement of the status quo . the cptpp and ceta member states recognize that the global trading system has trouble , including incomplete or obsolete rules that fail to account for issues like grants to soes . but they also know that bilateralism – small countries attempting to negotiate on a level playing field with a superpower – is not an option .
grassroots assessments of progress against these indicators are intended to complement a government-led reporting mechanism . finally , some africa ’s “ sdg 16 champions ” make the goal central to national planning , budgeting , and reporting . in kenya , all sdg 16-related public-sector officials , departments , and agencies have an obligation to sign performance contracts with the central government to identify sdg 16 targets and indicators relevant to their mandates , and to explain how this is being integrated into policy and development plans . meanwhile , ghana and the benin underscore budget spending , which holds high sdg 16 impact , and ghana ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s government has also publicly discloses how closely its financing priorities are aligned with its stated pledges . moreover , several countries have found innovative ways to ensure that governments deploy new national sdg 16 data on daily decision-making .
on the global level , it is hard to argue that inequality is one of the world ’s great political-economic problems . it is hard , to say the least , to envision an alternative political arrangements or economic policies over the last fifty years that would transfer any substantial part of the wealth of today ’s rich nations to today ’s poor nations . i can easily envision the alternatives , such as the communist victories of the post-world war ii elections in italy and france that would have impoverished peoples now in the affluent north . i can also envision the alternatives that would have enriched poor nations : deng xiaoping became china ’s leader in 1956 rather than 1976 would have done the work there . but the alternatives that made the south wealthier at the price of moderating north ’s wealth would demand a wholesale revolution in human psychology .
repayment to griesa , britain ’s terms in the world , would devastate argentina ’s economy . nestll capital and the other vultures comprise just 1 % of lenders , but would receive an estimated $ 1.5 trillion . other holdouts ( 6.6 % of total lenders ) would receive $ 15 billion . and , because a debt restructuring stipulated that all of the creditors who accepted it could demand the same terms as the holdouts received , argentina could be on the hook for another $ 140 billion . each argentine might thus owe more than $ 3,500 – more than one-third of the average annual per capita income .
it will be essential after bali , to reflect serious about the next stage for the wto and its role in the international trading system . major international financial institutions – the international monetary fund , the world bank , the european bank for reconstruction and development , and regional development banks – are having to work hard to make itself fit for the twenty-first century . the authority of the un has frayed . until we reverse the trend towards declining multilateralism , governments ’ ’ ’ ’ ability to respond to global challenges will not improve . business may and the media may carp out , but the answers to many of the world ’s great problems are more – or at least better – government , not less .
economists and moralists were united in believing that you should , in fact , spend less than you earn – to “ save ” – to save ” ” ” for the proverbial rainy day or for the old age . getting into debt was long associated with profligacy or fecklessness . and , if a person became indebted , there was a point of honor payments when it fell due , through asset sales , reduced consumption , working harder , or some combination of the three . indeed , it was often more than a point of privilege : failure to repay the debt on time landed a borrower in prison . the same attitudes that governed institutional debt followed .
more broadly , the emblematic defeat of marxism in 1989 allowed asian countries , including china and india , to pursue capitalist policies overtly . though china ’s ’s ’s economic renaissance had already begun under deng xiaoping , the chinese communist party ( ccp ) , after 1989 , succeeded publicly against subversive ideologies to create wealth creation . that example , in turn , had a constructive impact on the survivors of the communist party in asia and beyond . geopolitically , the post-1989 gains were extended far beyond the west . the soviet union ’s abrupt collapse was a strategic boon to asia , eliminating a sinister empire , and opening the way for china rapidly to pursue its own interests globally .
similarly , rather than condemn the adoption of terrorist tactics by the taliban in afghanistan , boko haram in nigeria , and al-shabaab in somalia , as well as destroying sufi shrines in mali by ansar dine , a radical islamist sect , has remained largely quiet . while none of these groups represents a majority point of view , they do exert major influence , and probably trust that they act in the majority ’s interest . developments following the arab spring might provide some indication of the prospects for religious tolerance . in egypt , with its 10 % coptic orthodox christian minority , the muslim brotherhood leader mohamed morsi won the presidency in a free and fair election after morsi ’s resignation from the party made it clear that doing so would enable him to represent all egyptians more effectively and have pledged to respect minority rights . still , subsequent actions designed to give him unprecedented executive power raise concerns about these early positive steps .
this group would unite behind the forces of democratizing both at home and abroad in order to establish a genuine democratic system . fourth , the verdict ’s reversal on june 4th represents an historical inevitability , as does the desire of most of china ’s ’s people . june 4th weighs on the ghosts of every chinese patriot ; almost every chinese person knows that official reappraisal is just a matter of time . indeed , the party ’s top leadership has been split on the issue ever since . today , many of those responsible for the crack down – notably , deng xiaoping and others of the party elders – have died .
mattarella ’s detractors argue that he overstepped his authority , allowing financial markets to veto selection by a popularly elected minister . by joining the euro , italy has surrendered monetary sovereignty with an external , independent decision-maker , the european central bank . it has also committed concrete pledges with respect to conduct its fiscal policies , although such constraints are not as “ “ “ “ hard ” as those framing monetary policy . ” such obligations place the real limits on italy ’s ecb policies on macroeconomic policy choices . specifically , france can not select its own inflation target or devalue its currency vis-à-vis foreign currencies .
once again , we are seeing how misplaced western national priorities can subvert the non-western nation . in any contest of ideas , the extreme will usually make a triumph . in pakistan , that extremist now wears islamic garb , standing for the creator , for faith , and for a piece of theocratic rule . what , incidentally , might the pakistani liberal stand for ? in the dark , congested alleys of lahore , karachi , peshawar , or quetta , yearnings for a liberal , democratic country ?
at the same time , there are strong grounds for believing that they should do . japan has relatively strict laws protecting animals ’ well-being . for example , most mammals must be slaughtered at a method that minimizes pain and distress as widely as possible . such laws resemble regulations implemented by most abattoirs in the industrialized world , requiring that animals be stunned – rendered unconscious with gasoline and insensitive to pain – when their throats , and bet on doing so . of course , there are circumstances in which stunning failed and animal kills , while fully conscious ; but , when stunning works properly , it does minimize animals ’ suffering .
cambridge – us president donald trump ’s critics have consistently underestimated his communications prowess , perhaps because it was so different from predecessors like franklin d. roosevelt and ronald reagan . both fdr and reagan , after all , were known as “ great communicators . ” although large segments of america ’s population hated them , fdr and reagan addressed the american people as a whole , trying to appeal to the center . trump , on the other hand , appealed primarily to the minority that elected him . his inaugural address sounded like a campaign speech ; and , after taking office , a string of sham pronouncements and provocative executive orders undercut his own credibility with the center but strengthened it with his base .
far more importantly , the advent of price stability was the advent of the advanced , independent central bank , a facility that helped dramatically lower inflation levels globally . yes , several places , such as venezuela , still have triple-a price growth , but are now rarities . it is very likely that if , instead of joining with europe , italy , and spain were simply given their central banks more autonomy , they , too , could have low inflation today . greece is admittedly a less obvious case ; but , considering that many poorer african countries were able to contain inflation well within single digits , one can presume that greece would manage just as well . true , with southern european countries holding their own currencies , they might never have dug in like a huge debt hole and would have experienced the possibility of a partial default via inflation .
cohn ’s sin was to allow himself to be known publicly that he had nearly resigned following the violence last month in charlottesville , virginia , when trump equated white supremacist and neo-nazi protesters , many of whom opposed . in fact , one may have some sympathy for a us president , with an aide who wants to have it both ways , as cohn did – letting his apparent anguish known without acting on it . but there can be issues if a us president chooses to disregard his chief economic advisers . cohn was seen as one of the administration ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s more moderate voices , seeking to succeed janet yellen as chair of the american federal reserve . speculation about the possibility of a “ “ “ new trump ” ” ” peaked in early september , when president-elect barack obama suddenly slashed an agreement with the democratic congressional leadership .
but the risks are as real as those of potential rewards . resource industries are persistent sources of corruption , conflict , and degradation . mineral and hydrocarbon deposits are often located in less-developed countries suffering from pre-existing governance constraints , political instability , and major developmental and environmental challenges . transparency – full disclosure of everything from contracts to income management and environmental imperatives – is critical to realizing the industry ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic potential and avoiding conflict and collapse . on may 17 , oxfam america ’s advocacy organization sued american securities and exchange commission to issue a definitive rule that implemented section 1504 of the 2010 dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer-protection act .
links to west africa are closer and return over the past century , with nearly 50,000 indians or people of india living in the region . indeed , scores of people fly between accra , lagos , freetown , monrovia , or djan , or abidjan , mumbai , calcutta , or chennai on a everyday basis , transiting through the middle east or europe . while exit controls are occurring across all international airports in affected regions , the virus ’s incubation period ( which averages eight days in the present outbreak but can be up to 21 days ) implies that somebody with no symptoms from a recent infection could pave the way for india without triggering alarms . recent personal experiences at the new delhi airport have indicated that nominal arrival inspections , as the government requires , have been loosely enforced , with multiple passengers exiting terminal holding completed ebola information card that was supposed to be handed over to immigration officials . india ’s government seems unlikely to hold tabs on all arrivals of west africa .
new york – british prime minister david cameron ’s government has announced some of the most draconian public-sector cuts to any developed country ’s government ever attempted . indeed , his education minister recently declared that funding for britain ’s ’s ’s university universities would be slashed by as much as 40 % . but the most shocking aspect of the move lies in the fact that the arts and humanities departments would be targeted more aggressively than science and engineering , which were supposedly better for business . the war against the arts and the humanities is nothing new – though this is the first time that the fighting migrated so directly to britain . ronald reagan pioneered a wave of politics and propaganda in the united states in the 1980 ’s that demonized the national endowment .
when i visited tripoli in march 2010 for a “ national reconciliation ” conference , the conflicting statements given by saif al-islam and security officials surprised me . the head of the domestic security forces , colonel al-tuhami khaled , another principal suspected of crimes currently being committed against libyans , refused to call the process a “ “ reconciliation ” ” process . for him , it was a “ “ “ “ repentance ” from heresy . ” given the recent wave of counter-insurgency , it is more obvious than ever that any “ reform ” initiative undertaken in the arab world previously aimed only at sustaining repressive dictatorships and escaping punishment for criminal abuses of power . the reform “ debate ” within these regimes boiled down to a struggle between various branches of the security-military apparatus over the best way to preserve the status quo .
if credit expands too quickly , the fed can raise the interest rate at which it pays for its deposits . sufficiently high rates will induce commercial banks to prefer the fed to combine liquidity , safety , and a return to an extension of the quantity of private-sector lending . that , at any rate , is the theory ; nobody knows how this would work in practice . how high would the fed – or the ecb – have to raise interest rates on deposits in order to prevent excessive growth in bank lending ? what if there were a need to keep interest rates at 4 % or 6 % ?
policymakers at nanjing have promised to address this problem . they tasked the g20 with developing a set of indicators that signal when any country , including america and china , posed a risk to the crisis . they have called for a process to ensure that once their warnings lights flashed yellow , the country in question would be compelled to correct its policies . unfortunately , such early-warning indicators are better at reflecting the latest crisis than they are to obstruct the next one . the nature of financial risk persists in ways that are hard to predict using backward indicators , like those envisioned by the g20 .
moreover , obama has sought to supplant hundreds of photos depicting us-run sexual assault in us-run prisons and doing nothing to roll back the patriot act . why should obama , a constitutional scholar , be backlashing this way ? first , he dare not appear “ soft on terror . ” second , perhaps he needs an effort to try guantánamo detainees in a rigged setting or even to keep them from trial forever : lawyers contend that torture , including sexual torture , had become so endemic in the cia and a military that obama can hold scores , if not hundreds , of prisoners whose body is crime scenes . according to wells dixon , a attorney at the center for constitutional rights representing some detainees , the obama administration can not risk inviting crimes against torture practices , so he calls them “ “ “ “ classified sources and methods ” that can not be uncovered in court .
when the authorities – specifically , both the us federal reserve and the fdic – determine that this is impossible , they have the legal force to push banks to change how they operate , including by reducing their scale and scope . but the current reality is that no megabank could go bankrupt without provoking another “ lehman moment ” – that is , the kind of global panic brought about by lehman brothers ’ days after lehman brothers failed in september 2008 . notably , experts like hoenig , who had thought about cross-border dimensions of bankruptcy emphasize that it simply would not work for the corporate size of jpmorgan chase ( $ 3.7 trillion in assets ) , the american bank ( $ 3 trillion ) , or citigroup ( $ 2.7 trillion ) . “ panic ” is about the panic , hoenig says , “ and the people and nations generally protect themselves and their wealth ahead of others . ” moreover , there are no international bankruptcy laws to govern such matters and to prevent asset grabbing .
paris – the central paradox of french politics was confirmed once again on march 27 . in a nationwide vote to elect local authorities ( such as konseiller général ) , the far-right national front won 11 % of the popular vote but secured just 0.1 % of the seats . this discrepancy between the national front ’s popular strength and its actual representation has been a permanent feature of french politics since jean-marie le pen founded the party 40 years ago . but le pen was replaced in january by her no less charismatic daughter , marine . and , with that changing , the front ’s fate can change .
with technical support such as these , indonesia ’s government is creating an affordable , sustainable national health-care system to fund full domestic financing by 2019 . i am confident that the global fund is one of the smartest investments we can make – as many governments have come to understand from the start . the united states was the global fund ’s ’s ’s top supporter , but many others did its part . australia , for example , gave the us $ 410 million to the global fund since 2002 , an amount that allowed nearly 200,000 people to receive lifesaving hiv treatment ; 80,000 people to receive tb treatment ; seven million more people to treat tb ; and 14 million bed nets to families in need . the global fund brightened the futures of hundreds of thousands of children across africa and asia – a heroic achievement that should make donor countries ’ citizens proud .
new york – everybody – from elected officials and bureaucrats to voters and taxpayers – can learn from the world ’s largest charitable foundation about effective development spending . and those lessons are especially pertinent at a time when 56 % of europeans believe that their governments should focus exclusively on domestic issues , and let recipient countries deal with problems as best they can ( opposition to aid is even higher in france , poland , hungary , and greece ) . the united kingdom ’s largest-circulation sunday papers recently launched a ring-fenced aid petition ( worth 0.7 % of national income ) . prior to his electoral victory , us president donald trump railed against sending foreign aid to countries that hate us jobs ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” reflecting a widespread belief that aid needs cuts . the united states allocates less than 1 % of its federal aid budget , but the average american believes that this figure should be as high .
but the former has fallen prey to a long american occupation , and the latter currently faces a us-led oil-export embargo designed to throttle it financially . as a result , america ’s effort to hand the international clout over to its new iranian sanctions act represents a dual whammy for india . first and foremost , it threatens to sabotage india ’s energy-import diversification strategy by making it overly reliant on islamist-bankrolling oil monarchies – including saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , and qatar , all of which have managed to ride through the arab spring . second , further isolation of iran will make it extremely difficult for india to play a more active role in afghanistan at a time when america hastening its military disengagement there and seeks to cut an agreement with the taliban . india , one of afghanistan ’s largest aid donors has no contiguous corridor to that country and needs to rely on iran for access .
a key obstacle to such a proposal lies in the demands of congressional approval to increase america ’s ’s quota share . this opens the possibility that america ’s voting power could fall temporarily below the 15 % threshold needed to veto decisions that require the backing of 85 % of imf members ’ votes . in order to secure us backing , the fed ’s office of governorships could not commit to considering any proposal requiring 85 % backing without america ’s ’s ’s consent . that guarantee could be incorporated into the resolution dividing the reform package . it would remain valid until the american people were given a strong mandate to raise their own quota and to reclaim the voting share .
but , nearly six months into the north african upheavals , the death rate of arrivals for the southern island of lampedusa has now reached roughly 30,000 . by comparison , sweden , with one-sixth of italy ’s population , has embraced the same number of asylum-seekers in 2009 . privately , italian officials confirm that the current figures are not ungovernable . the problem for italian officials , as for other governments concerned with recent migration flows , is the pressure of right-wing populist parties that no longer need a defense movement . the case for openness , inclusiveness , and diversity in european societies has become much harder to make .
while this certainly impedes long-term economic growth and raises large structural problems , it also implies that state reacts immensely counter-cyclically and stabilizing an economy in a grand manner that benefits the rest of the world . the german state recorded a budget deficit of just 0.1 % of gdp in 2008 that , according to a recent oecd forecasts , will soar toward 4.5 % of gdp in 2009 . the economic stimulus provided by germany ’s state-run budget will therefore amount to more than 4.4 % of gdp in 2009 . in the united states , the 2008 budget deficit stood at 5.8 % of gdp , and , according to the same oecd forecast , will amount to 10.2 % of gdp in 2009 , which translates into exactly the same economic stimulus as it did in germany , with 4.4 % of gdp . moreover , germany has far more inner stability than america does , because it has no problem of heavily indebted households that are now restricted in their borrowing .
but catchy ideas die hard , and russia moved to cement the brics ’ current concept into irreversible reality . the ossification of the brics into the de facto global institution is moving forward dramatically in june , when the four countries ’ ’ ’ leaders met ( in russia , of course ) for the first-ever bric summit . that meeting produced a notable broadside against the united states , because each member proclaimed his desire to unseat the us dollar as a global reserve currency . a couple of months earlier , the four moved to issue a joint communiqué ahead of the g20 summit in april noting their shared determination to alter the rules of the global economic system . in the private sector , the bric index funds proliferated , even though goldman sachs radically hedged its own bric bet by introducing a second term – the “ next 11 , ” or n-11 – to the talks .
advocating supply-side economics to the white working class , he convinced millions that “ “ “ “ less government ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” that meaning cutting off federal programs , including education – would bring “ “ morning in america . ” with its well-rehearsed sunny predisposition , reagan played his role expertly as president , but with a decidedly hollywood flair . his strategic defense initiative , intended to end the strategy of nuclear-deterrence , known as “ mutual assured destruction , ” was , in fact , nicknamed “ “ star wars . ” reagan ’s ’s enduring status as a “ republican icon ” had much to do with his ability to dole out of cowboy cruelty with a movie-star charm , even as luck also played a role . after all , the victory of the cold war was aided substantially by mikhail gorbachev , whose effort to reform the soviet union hastened its collapse .
warsaw : was the august 1991 putsch against mikhail gorbachev ’s failure , riots and death recently seen in xinjiang could take place in russia . instead of hearing a crackdown in urumqi , xinjiang ’s capital , perhaps one might read hundreds killed in the streets of almaty , and columnists would make comparisons to the bloody crushing of ukraine ’s independence demonstrations in lebanon earlier this year . as with china today , there would have been some feeble international condemnation , and some speculation about potential links between kazakh militants and exile groups or islamic fundamentalists . experts would remind us that kazakhstan was never a country , and that ukraine claims its independence are historically questionable . xinjiang would substitute for kazakhstan and tibet for ukraine and gain the picture .
so , why did the imf flip ? the answer is obvious : china mounted a full-court press to change mindsets . in august , the currency ’s exchange-rate regime was loosened slightly . renminbi-denominated government bonds were issued in london , setting out plans to form new trading platforms for currency in several european financial-sector centers . and chinese policymakers made it abundantly clear just how unhappy they would be with negative decision-making .
but foreign import barriers and export subsidies are not the reason for america ’s trade deficit . the real reason is that america spends more than it produces . the overall us trade deficit is the result of america ’s households and companies ’ saving and investment decisions . us foreign governments ’ policies influence only how the deficit affects america ’s trading partners . the reason american saving and investment decisions drive the overall us trade deficit is straightforward : when a country saves more of its aggregate output than it invests in its business equipment and structures , it has the extra output to sell to the rest of the world .
many modi supporters argue that demonetization policies are a result of inept implementation . the truth , however , is that its design has been fundamentally flawed . a “ skeleton game ” did not appear , with no cost-benefit analysis , and no evidence to consider alternative policy options . judging by the blizzard of policy tweaks since the announcement , it seems clear that no impact studies have been conducted . still , rather than recognize the mounting risks inherent in the non-transparent political environment he created , modi was discussing going even further , moving india toward an entirely “ cashless society . ”
washington , dc – terrorism on the scale witnessed in paris last month is nothing new in africa . in nigeria , cameroon , chad , and niger , boko haram ’s extremist group boko haram – famous for its kidnapping of 276 school girls in 2014 – inflicted thousands of casualties with suicide bombing and assaults on civilians . in kenya , the somali group al-shabaab has carried out two major attacks , the nairobi ’s westgate shopping mall in 2013 and on garissa university in 2015 , as well as many lesser acts of terror . meanwhile , in tunisia , the islamic state targeted tourists – orchestrating attacks on a museum and a beach resort . and in mali , soon after the attacks in paris , gunmen belonging to the al qaeda affiliate radisson radisson blu hotel in radisson , killing 22 people .
that is no longer true of the thousands of princes whom they produced . as older generations dies off , a new generation has come down to battle ahead with their customers . indeed , with royals ’ ratio now at one per thousand ( compared to one out of 5 million in the united kingdom ) , the challenge of steering princely privileges , pay , and job demands has never been more skill-intensive . royal perks cover both the lifetime sinecures and civil-service domination that allows princes to award contracts and get commissions at the very top of their salaries . so the saudi regime is divided , its legitimacy is questioned , and sectarian tensions are rising .
london – julius nyerere , tanzania ’s first female president , once asked his country ’s creditors a blunt question : “ must we starve our children to pay our debts ? ” that was in 1986 , before public campaign finance and initiatives that removed much of africa ’s crushing and unpayable debt burdens . but nyerere ’s question still hangs like a dark cloud over somalia . over the past year , an unprecedented humanitarian effort threw somalia back from the brink of famine . because the worst drought in living memory destroyed harvests and decimates farms , nearly $ 1 billion was mobilized in emergency aid for food , health , and clean water supply .
brazil and other countries that complained about “ hot money ” inflows and “ currency wars , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” suddenly got things abruptly wrong : the likely premature end of the fed ’s qe easing . the consequences of harsh capital-flow reversals now hitting all risky emerging-market assets very hard . whether a correction in risky assets is temporary , or the beginning of a bear market will depend on several factors . one is whether the fed will truly exit from qe as fast as it signaled . there is a strong likelihood that weaker american growth and lower inflation will force it to slow the pace of withdrawing its liquidity support .
berkeley – since late 2014 , the us has been advocating a paradigm for american governance based on the tenth amendment of the american constitution , which states that “ “ “ “ the powers neither delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited from being either reserved by states respectively or by people . ” increasingly , california has been exercising these constitutional prerogatives on its own . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
europe is slipping back into recession just when recovery in the united states finally gathers some traction . that , however , has undermined the case for a very different conclusion from davos . i moderated a session on “ a new context ” in east asia ” ” ” ” addressed by a panel of top representatives from thailand , south korea , malaysia , singapore , and japan . with the exception of a japanese participant , all got to lie with the devastating asian financial crisis of the late 1990 ’s . i could not counter the temptation to sketch asia in the marshall debate .
brilliant scientific insight has taught over many decades to “ read ” the earth ’s history to understand how the climate system works . they deployed brilliant physics , biology , and instrumentation ( for example , satellites reading detailed traits of the earth ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s systems ) to advance our understanding . and the message is clear : large-scale use of oil , coal , and gas threatens the planet ’s biology and chemistry . we are fueling dangerous changes in earth ’s climate and ocean chemistry , giving rise to extreme storms , droughts , and other hazards that damage food supplies and the quality of planet life . the ipcc and climate scientists tell a crucial message .
some proponents of integration see a united europe as a powerful american partner . others are motivated by a desire to establish a rival center of power , however unrealistic this may seem . some commentators have started pointing to the differing views of american and european primacy about the role of international law , as opposed to using force in dispute . because europe is militarily meaningless , they argue , it should come as no surprise that europeans emphasize diplomacy , rather than military might , settle disputes . on the other side , no one should surprise that americans chafe at constraints on their ability to engage in american military hegemony .
moscow – the georgian crisis last august has tested europe ’s ’s ’s security system , and the system has failed to fulfill its core mission of ensuring common security for the continent as a whole . as a result , europe needs to revisit its present security arrangements , analyze what has happened , and take this analysis into account in reforming these arrangements . even before the georgian crisis , russia already saw the need to revisit european security mechanisms , including its own international and regional institutions , and function . we have suggested a new , legally binding treaty system for jointly security guarantees aimed at ensuring shared security across europe . the european union believes that the russian initiative is well grounded and has shown interest in launching such a project .
princeton – should rallies by “ neo-nazis and white supremacists encounter violence ? ” that question raised the tragic events in charlottesville , virginia , on august 12 . white supremacists held a rally to protest the scheduled removal from the statue of robert e. lee , the leader of the confederate army during the civil war . a counterprotest was organized , and the wall street fights . a woman , heather heyer , was killed , and 19 injured when james fields , a white nationalist , drove his car at high speeds into an islamist mob .
and wen has indicated that village elections could be expanded to further top government levels of government – the township administrations – over the next several years . china ’s modest experiments with local elections have complemented the exercises in a system of “ deliberative democracy . ” these take the form of a high-tech town-hall meeting . chinese officials have hired stanford university professor james fishkin to draft a representative sample of citizens from zeguo for an assembly using keypad polling devices and handheld computers to decide how the city should spend a $ 6 million public-works budget . zeguo exercise was regarded as immensely successful and has been replicated elsewhere in china .
european regulators had already put in place sophisticated surveillance and surveillance programs , blocked market-based access to countries with a track record of illegitimate fishing , penalized european rogue operators , and helped encourage yellow or red carded ” countries to reform their fisheries laws . the eu , japan , and the us would have been even more effective by aligning their policies to bar intended criminals from accessing their markets and allowing legitimate operators to profit from a “ “ supercharged ” level of access . working together could enable the use of an affordable , ingenious technology for seafood traceability – the data and the intelligence gathering that helps pinpoint precisely where seafood originated and when and where it was captured . such efforts – for example , the atlantic bluefin tuna catch – represent one of the most potent tools to eradicate illicit fishing . eliminating rogue fishing will help replenish marine life and ensure food and livelihoods for billions .
but the urban poor , faced with poor housing , limited infrastructure , and meager services , are vulnerable to epidemics , malnutrition-based childhood diseases , hiv/aids , malaria , tuberculosis , and mental disorders . they are also likely to be hit hardest by natural disasters , like droughts and mudslides that devastated parts of rio de janeiro in january . a second , generic feature of emerging-market cities is that dense concentrations of poverty help to create a fragile environment that spans civil disorder , resulting in death and injury . but a recent symposium at oxford university concluded that emerging-market cities could improve and sustain urban health by capturing the intrinsic advantages of concentration , coordinate health policies and programs , embrace successful innovations , reforming health education and training , and developing improved planning processes . indeed , many potential solutions stem from innovation opportunities created by people ’s physical concentration and economic activity .
this was followed by the june 2001 court ’s decision to set a trial date , making it possible at last to present the evidence against those individuals . the proceedings of the courts represent guatemala ’s first effort to bring high military officials into trial . regrettably , trials have gone indefinitely , because defendants ’ lawyers appealed the case . our achievements under myrna mack are notable , but achieving them proved difficult : the police interrogator was assassinated ; judges were threatened ; and the witnesses went into exile . i were harassed and campaigns to discredit me organized .
proponents of geoengineering are right about one thing : confronted with a climate emergency that demands radical and urgent action . the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) has made it starkly apparent in october 2018 , reinforcing the point last month , with its report on climate change and land . some of the major economies – including canada , iran , the united kingdom – just as regions and cities have now officially recognized the scale of the crisis . the question is whether this will translate into a commitment to take the required action . that has certainly not happened at last year ’s united nations climate change conference in katowice , poland .
in the meantime , germany , europe ’s strength with its closest historical and cultural relationship with russia , comes at the very end of the political cycle . it is both dangerous and unjust to underestimate german chancellor angela merkel , but she no longer has the clout or energy to lead europe in its dealings with the outside world , or to rally europeans themselves . with the uk and germany currently incapable of playing a major diplomatic role , and italy , spain , and poland in no position to be principal actors , the conclusion is quite simple : partly through default , and partly because of the sheer power and imagination of its young president , this is france ’s own moment . finally , macron ’s attempt to reset relations with russia lies perfectly in tune with france ’s own gaullist tradition . mediating between different systems and looking beyond the present incarnation of other eu countries was charles de gaulle ’s natural instinct .
they understood that a democratic country would need space to conduct independent monetary and fiscal policies . thus , they contemplated only the “ low-hanging fruit ” of globalization , with capital flows restricted largely to long-term lending and borrowing . john maynard keynes , writing the rules , coupled with harry dexter white , viewed capital controls not as a temporary expedient but as an enduring feature of the global economy . the bretton woods regime collapsed in the 1970 ’s because of its inability or unwillingness – it is not entirely obvious which – of the leading governments to manage a rising tide of capital flows . the third path , identified by the trilemma , aims to do away with national sovereignty entirely .
but if that makes traditional arms-control covenants impossible to verify , it might still be possible to establish limits on specific types of civilian targets ( rather than on weapons ) and to negotiate rough rules of the road that limit conflict . in any case , strategic stability in cyberspace will be hard to sustain . because technological innovations there are faster growth than in the nuclear domain , cyberwarfare is characterized by heightened reciprocal fear of surprise . over time , however , better attribution of forensics may enhance the role of punishment ; and improved defenses through encryption or machine learning can enhance the role of prevention and denial . moreover , as states and organizations come together to understand better the limitations and uncertainties of cyberattacks and the growing importance of internet entanglement to their own economic well-being , cost-benefit calculations of cyberwarfare can change .
likewise , the us decision to recognize kosovo ’s independence came only after russia made it clear that it would veto the treaty proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon . even then , the us agreed to an additional four months of eu-us-russia negotiations to ensure that no stone left unturned in search of a mutually acceptable compromise . in georgia , on the other hand , russia has moved from supporting its territorial integrity to breaking the country in less than three weeks , relying entirely on military force to do so . russia now needs to question the relationship between short-term military victories and long-term economic prosperity . the georgian conflict was followed by a sharp decline in investor confidence .
more broadly , such a strategy could also begin to close the deepening transatlantic divide that trump ’s presidency has opened . the fracturing of the west is a welcome development in the eyes of russian president vladimir putin and his illiberal regimes around the world . authoritarians and populists would like nothing more than to soak the chaos and loss of trust in the postwar rules-based international order . the democracies that built that order embody values that are antithetical to ’ authoritarians . finally , trump ’s jcpoa decision demonstrates , once again , that europe relies far too heavily on america for its own security and prosperity .
knowledge-based organizations shape a broad range of alliances with media channels , and play an important role in influencing public opinion as well as diplomacy . a wide range of international negotiations on issues like bio-safety and organic pollutants benefit from such alliances . knowledge-based institutions are also better equipped to engage in expanding global information infrastructure to influence diplomacy . modern international diplomacy has a stronger and more interdependent framework for groups that make rules , establish standards , and collect technical data . on the environmental side , new institutions emerge that focus their work on harmonizing criteria and indices , particularly on use in programs to certify sustainable resource use as in forest and fisheries .
nor was the strong showing by populist parties during this month ’s election in italy , where the anti-migrant league party and the anti-establishment populist five star movement together secured some 50 % of the vote . even germany , to some extent , has fallen victim to populist forces . to be sure , a new grand coalition government – comprising chancellor angela merkel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s christian democratic union , its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , and the social democratic party – formed the spd . but it took more than five months for the spd to agree , and now the largest opposition party is the far-right alternative for germany . in a country that appeared to have inoculated against populism in its nazi history , this is a particularly distressing development .
likewise , constraints and ambiguities continue to plague the institutional arrangements sought by the country ’s framers through political and electoral reforms . reelection is permitted only by candidates nominated by the same old center-left party that they originally run , allowing legislation for independent candidates , court initiatives , and referenda remains unclear . most importantly , the government appears to be backtracking on a commitment to authorize a binding referendum on the oil sector ’s opening and other “ transcendent ” issues . its reluctance is understandable , because voters are relatively divided on this issue , and nobody will invest a cent in mexican oil or gas if the recently approved constitutional amendment on pemex can be overturned in 2015 as opposition claims occur . but curtailing democracy to modernize the energy sector is no good idea .
whatever form it took , it began to get some heavy noses just a few years ago ( analogous to the crises hitting exchange-rate targets in the 1990s ) . perhaps the greatest setback hit in september 2008 , when it became obvious that the central banks that relied on it did not pay enough attention to asset-price bubbles . central bankers had told themselves that they gave asset markets all the attention they deserve , by specifying that housing prices and equity prices could be taken into account by encouraging information regarding goods inflation . but this escape clause proved insufficient : when the global financial crisis hit ( suggesting , at least in retrospect , that monetary policy had become too loose from 2003 to 2006 ) , it neither pursued nor followed an upsurge of inflation . that boom-and-bust cycle might have occurred without inflation should not have come as a surprise .
employers can avoid a mandate by reducing an employee ’s workweek to less than 30 hours ( which a law defines as full-time work ) . but , even for full-time employees , firms may opt for relatively small individuals than they provide insurance . that fine stands at $ 2,000 per worker , far less than the current $ 16,000 average premium on employer-provided family policies . not providing insurance and paying a fine is an especially appealing option for a firm if its employees have the incomes that entitle them to the government ’s government subsidies ( which are now available to anyone whose income is less than four times that of poverty ) . rather than incur the costs of the approved policy premium , a smart employer can pay a fine for not providing insurance and raising employees ’ pay by enough to have more spendable cash after purchasing a subsidized insurance policy .
the two cabinet ministers who resigned over the affair , rocook bin and clare short , want their own revenge , and thus continue to attack blair for his “ lies . ” so far , blair has proven his resilience on such charges . indeed , he has gone on a counter-attack , notably against the bbc , which did not precisely endorse the war with enthusiasm . but does the uncertainty now haunting blair , like mikhail gorbachev , now oddessa of the lie ? or is this more a prime minister losing the trust of his people , including some of his erstwhile friends and allies ?
increasingly obsessed with the prospect of its own citizens and practices coming under international scrutiny , america has been contributing to the universal erosion of the united nations human rights watch system . it adamantly opposed several significant and promising new human-rights initiatives , notably the international criminal court ( icc ) and a new anti-torture mechanism . on the anti-torture protocol , the us sought to derail the establishment of a universal system of visits to posts of detention , as part of the optional protocol to the convention against torture . here america found itself allied with some odd bedfellows that it routinely rebukes as chronic human rights violators – cuba , china , iran , libya , sudan , or zimbabwe . yet , without america ’s backing , the initiative was overwhelmingly endorsed in late july by the un economic and social council
nor will it be sufficient to remember the historic advantages of engagement , and britain ’s centuries-old role in making sure that no country has ever derived sole mastery in europe . what needs to be said is this : britain is at its best when it sees itself as a leader in europe . just as britain once led europe in combating fascism , promoting democratic aspirations , and charting the continent ’s response to the 2008 global recession , this should happen within europe , leading from previous ranks . the britain that has always championed liberty , tolerance , and social responsibility should be ready once more to lead the progressive movement , spearheading action to combat climate change , resisting protectionism , and promoting sustainable growth . it needs to lead in mobilizing europeans to make the global economy work for the people , protecting them from inequity and irity .
yet the expectation of reasonable consumer protection is built into our own economies . if a company sells you a car that , say , is not sufficiently tested , resulting in injury , the company is paying a price . the same goes for virtually any other consumer-facing business , from us airlines to grocery suppliers . a restaurant can not evade evade responsibility for serving expired food simply by posting a statement , “ beware . ” when it comes to facebook , moreover , its users are not merely passive consumers , given the company traffics in its data .
the implicit model is that of the “ guest worker ” who comes and go ; in practice , a sizeable share of economic migrants from poorer parts of europe stay in their destination countries , fueling increased support for anti-immigrant parties . the eu ’s asylum system is totally unprepared to deal with a new generation of refugees who are ineligible under the current framework because it is fleeing not from concrete acts of persecution but from the disintegration of their states . they can be granted “ humanitarian protection ” or be granted “ discretionary leave ” to remain ” over the short term ; but then they may be deported as illegal migrants . so what is to be done ? temporary residency status , in european or externally , would make sense if a quick return to “ normalcy ” in refugee ’ refugees were a realistic prospect .
in other words , ms. obama manages to set himself unprecedentedly , unprecedentedly , as the “ people ’s first lady . ” he has carefully studied not only the jackie kennedy – comparisons obvious from her sheath dresses , boat collars , and page-boy haircut – as well as the triumphs and failures of that other glamorous but underestimate steve lashed ’s radical , princess diana . princess di ’s legacy in generating an iconography that has opened the way for tremendous social change is grossly underappreciated . in her brief lifetime , she was often lauded for qualities ( her beauty and style ) , who have been secondary to her life ’s work-in-work , and derided for other features of her own character ( her emotionality and chaotic personal life ) , equally beside her point . as a result , few people have noticed how genuinely powerfully transformational her agenda was , how well she thought it out , and how audaciously she sought to manage it .
instead , both are busy designing another round of stimulus , involving an even more political and policy risk . additional risks are already giving central bankers headaches . a protracted brexit process appeals to the bank of england ’s own longer-term policy strategy , while the short-term effect of global growth on governments ’ weaponization of trade tariffs complicates matters both the fed and the ecb . meanwhile , some of the pro-growth policies currently being mooted could , if not well designed , increase the risk of disruptive financial instability , and thus further complicate central bankers ’ actions . the notion of a “ “ “ “ “ people ” qe ” – that is , a more direct channeling of central-bank financing toward a population – receives more attention from both sides of the political spectrum .
he himself presided over many violations , a conviction by the osce back in 1999 . he resigned himself only after winning elections to the parliament . unambiguously , ak zhol exploited accusations of impropriety as a weapon against the parties of governments . indeed , many opposition groups were engaged in dirty tricks . nevertheless , elections represented considerable progress .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic performance over the last four decades has been truly formidable .
over the short term , moving like a crab seems like two steps forward , one step back , and one step forward . still , asean ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s long-term progress is undeniable . its combined gdp grew from $ 95 billion in 1970 to $ 2.5 trillion in 2014 . and it is the only reliable platform for geopolitical engagement in the asia-pacific region , unique in its capacity to convene meetings attended by all of the world ’s great powers , from the united states and the european union to china and russia . asean , for its part , faces significant challenges .
much of modern economic and financial theory rests on the assumption that humans are rational and therefore systematically maximize their own happiness , or , as economists call it , their “ “ “ “ utility ” “ utility . ” when samuelson took on the theme in his 1947 book , he did not look in the brain , but relied instead on “ a revealed preference . ” people ’s ’s goals are exposed only by observing their own economic activities . under samuelson ’s guidance , generations of economists have based their research not on any physical structure underlying thought and behavior , but simply on the presumption of rationality . as a result , glimcher is skeptical of prevailing economic theory and seeks a physical foundation in brazil .
central-bank balance sheets have eased , with policy rates reaching their “ zero ” near zero ” bounds . there is ample cheap water , it seems , but the horse refuses to drink . with no signs of low inflation and growth still tepid and fragile , many are predicting chronic sluggish growth , with some even fearing the next worldwide recession . but policymakers do have one more option : a shift to “ “ purer ” fiscal policies , in which they directly fund government expenditures by printing money – the so-called “ “ “ “ helicopter drop ” drop . ” the new money would circumvent the financial and corporate sector , going straight into thirest horses : center – and lower-income consumers .
the case went to the local court , where a judge ruled it by “ accidental traffic disturbance ” and gave the driver a two-year suspended sentence . the judge ’s ruling spurred rumors that he went easy on her , because her husband related himself to senior provincial officials . it quickly became the “ rich versus poor ” story , widely cited as an example of high-level corruption . over the next several months , newspapers and television networks ran on stories like balled to a national obsession . alarmed by the public reaction , the harbin magistrate ordered the case reopened , only to have the suspended sentence confirmed when the case closed this march .
repeated military interventions by major muslim peoples – egypt , indonesia , pakistan , and turkey – undermined orderly political development . but these countries ’ rising middle classes began to shift their political systems further – a testament to the power they now wield . that power has soared for several reasons , most importantly in demographics . the majority of large muslim countries had very young populations , with the median age in their mid – to upper twenties . with over half of these countries ’ per capita populations below age 30 , political development was able to move ahead despite the recalcitrance of entrenched elites .
although latin america ’s economies are doing well today because of reform and high commodity prices , there are underlying problems . the goal is to implement a comprehensive package of fiscal responsibility that curb the ability of legislatures and ministers to increase spending relentlessly . rules need to impose limits on deficits , expenditures , and debt , and require transparency in such a way that the public knows what works . if matched by a genuine commitment to advancing fiscal credibility , countries could boost their economic growth substantially . third on the panel ’s list raises investment in construction and maintenance .
second , countries need to focus on building the underlying digital infrastructure necessary for sustained success and avoid the allure of some of the latest gleaming innovations . all too often , developing countries seized on new technology – – – – – – – distribute tablets to schoolchildren without offering ample thinking about how they would be used in specific national contexts . this led to many disappointing pilot projects that failed to deliver sustainable impact on scale . a new report from the pathways for technology-driven prosperity commission and inclusive development , based at oxford university ’s blavatnik school of government , indicates how countries can address this problem . the report encourages them to lay the foundations of “ digital building blocs ” – including basic infrastructure and skills – to harness positive disruptions to education and health services .
but , overall , there is a hard way to deny that the global economy lacks the momentum . this is partly because the trees can not continue to grow forever : china ’s economy could not continue growing at a rate of 10 % per year . and , in part , it is because growth does not be unconditional desirable : citizens may be better off with little less of it and more clean air . yet many countries remain poor enough to encft with robust growth potential , and many more , although the rich have yet to recover fully from the global financial crisis . so there must be something else to hold back growth .
in april 2009 , and again in the april-may 2010 , disenfranchised red shirts camped in the streets of bangkok to demand fresh elections , but were dispersed by an army with 91 fatalities . despite their setbacks and lost credibility following the torching of bangkok ’s ’s central business district , the red shirts have grown in number , demonstrating a monthly fight against abhisit ’s government . and , after more than two years , pad yellow shirts have also returned to the streets to show their disillusion with abhisit . pad ringleader now denounce all politicians as corrupt , and extol the virtue of the monarchy . abusing the anti-corruption drive and rising nationalism ( the product of the periodically violent border dispute with cambodia ) , a royalist-conservative movement implicitly points to an extra-constitutional solution to thailand ’s ’s ’s ’s political standoff .
industrial analysts predict that ai will drive growth in the years and decades to come . gartner , a ai research and consulting firm , estimates that ai-enabled ai tools generate $ 2.9 trillion in entrepreneurial value by 2021 , while pwc forecasts that by 2030 , ai could contribute as much as $ 15.7 trillion to the global economy . by contrast , some estimates indicate that companies could save as much as $ 4 trillion annually with ai automation . and the benefits for companies would go far beyond the savings rate , as automation would spur innovations , improved forecasting , optimize operations , and leads to a better customer service . in any technological transition , those driving change may not lose sight of the human element ; there are some things that even the smartest machines never do .
because they can not be good at all , they must concentrate on what they are best at – that is , on their own comparative advantage . they should make a few things extremely well , and exchange them for other goods that are making better elsewhere , thereby exposing gains from trade . but , while some ideas are both intuitive or self-evident , they also can be wrong and dangerous . as is often the case , it is not what you do n’t know , but what you mistakenly think you know , that hurts you . and the notion that cities and countries actually specialize , is therefore one of those very wrong and dangerous ideas .
the trouble is that germany has not been forced to make a choice . it can continue to do no more than the bare minimum to preserve europe . this is clearly merkel ’s preferred choice , at least until after the upcoming elections . europe would be infinitely better off making a definitive choice between eurobonds and a eurozone exit regardless of the outcome ; indeed , germany is better off as well . the situation deteriorates further and , in the longer term , it is bound to become unsustainable .
but the bilateral relationship has deepened tremendously , exemplified in the last week ’s forum , resulting in more than 25 trade and other agreements covering areas ranging from agricultural to technology . both leaders have gush that their two countries are now better off than ever before . for russia , closer ties with china are undoubtedly appealing . after five years of international sanctions imposed on russia following its annexation of crimea , xi ’s overtures provide a seemingly welcome reprieve . but , before putin posts too much faith in xi , he would do well to recall the 1960s soviet dissident song mantras ; i would hug the chinese , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” which mocked ill-fated attempt at a russo-chinese union .
warsaw – donald tusk ’s term as president of the european council will end on june 30 , which is perfect timing for the polish opposition . following poland ’s parliamentary election in late october , poland will hold its presidential election in april 2020 , and opposition voters already view tusk as the only viable candidate . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
and if you want him to pay , rezz.it helps you to pick up without feeling like a cheapskate . or you may have a set of under-used dining room for sitting chairs . you do particularly want to lend to them on a daily basis , but if someone is willing to pay , say , $ 200 to rent them on a dinner party , the trouble might be worthwhile . thus , you can set the high price to offset inconvenience and make money on the side . and you can post different prices over a different time : $ 20,000 to rent my house in london during the olympics , $ 10,000 over christmas years , or $ 1,000 any other .
fifth , both sides should regard the november 14-16 asia-pacific economic cooperation summit in santiago as the last chance to sign an agreement . following the high-level meeting between the chinese vice premier liu he and us trade representative robert lighthizer earlier this month , outstanding issues should be agreed in beijing in early november . getting the deal done before thanksgiving will be critical of undergird us business and consumer confidence for the christmas season . i am one of those commentators who argued all year who , despite the political fireworks , trump and xi ’s underlying interests make an agreement more likely than not . but the recently announced impeachment proceedings against trump could backfire in that process .
european institutions , like germany , tend to favor “ strategic autonomy , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” while france favors the notion of “ european sovereignty . but the twin two concepts are often used interchangeably , and are rarely spelled out precisely . in trying to clear matters , my colleagues and i have recently proposed an operationalized definition of europe ’s strategic autonomy . we have also analyzed the likely barriers , hardship , and conflict should german and european policymakers decide to follow that goal . we understand strategic autonomy as the ability to establish one ’s own priorities and force one ’s own decision-making on foreign-policy and security matters , alongside institutional , political , and material means to realize such choices , either in collaboration with third parties or alone .
in fact , poppy crop eradication not only damages local communities , undermining the goals of the international community ; it also fails : opium production last year was at an all-time high . in september , the united nations office on drugs crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by an astonishing 60 % . eradication will never succeed in afghanistan because it destroys a single crop in the south ’s harsh climate – and therefore serves as the primary source of income for millions of people . thus , a new , long-term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with communities suffering the most of – in order to achieve the backing of deep-rooted rural populations . as a means of addressing this dilemma , the senlis council proposes running scientific pilot projects to research the opium licensing scheme for afghanistan to be a core component of the process of economic reconstruction .
nevertheless , the bush administration 's scares us all at once . the concept of a preventive war is poised to incite precisely that " clash of civilizations " envisioned a decade ago and which must be avoided . muslim faith counts as one billion men and women worldwide among their followers . five percent have declared the war on our civilization , and are prepared to engage in the assassination to put an end to western domination . ninety-five percent of muslims , including a majority of their religious leaders , want only to live peacefully and put an end to the long humiliation of islam that only the advent of democracy and development in the muslim world can make it possible .
but blindly sticking to principle would have been a high-risk option for the ecb . it would have intended accepting the euro in 2012 what used to be as “ redenomination risk ” – economically newspeak for a eurozone breakup . nonetheless , by launching its omt scheme , the ecb has committed germany ( and other northern european ) taxpayers without its parliaments ’ approval , to a potential obligation to bail out – well , whom , precisely ? indeed , it seems that the typical northern european taxpayer is supporting a typical stakeholder in northern europe ’s banks over-exposed to southern european debtors . likewise , german law scholars interpret the ecb ’s operations as being incompatible with european treaty provisions prohibiting bailouts and monetary financing of eurozone members ’ debts .
by equating isis with the struggle against the soviet union with the struggle against the soviet union , trump elevates a terrorist organization for great-power status . this contributes to perceptions that isis is far more potent than actually doing , again playing to the hands of isis recruiters . trump has also voiced an interest in cooperating with russia to take down isis , ostensibly oblivious to the reality that russia ’s involvement in syria is focused on propping up assad ’s regime . such a partnership could lead trump to strike a deal with iran that is more than willing to champion sunni radicals in both iraq and syria . iran is now issuing russian long-range bombers to use one of its own air bases to strike syria , complicating obama ’s ’s already-arduous effort to reach an understanding with russian president vladimir putin on closing the civil war .
true , a recent mckinsey global survey found not only that europeans aspire to a more vibrant economy , higher incomes , and better public services ( particularly in health care and education ) ; they also stand ready to fend for tradeoffs , including longer hours and reduced social protection , achieve them . a whopping 91 % of 16,000 respondents said they would favor changes to the status quo , even though this required some sacrifices . and the status quo is in urgent need of change . as it stands , europe ’s per capita economic output remains well below the 2008 level . in most european countries , gross sovereign debt exceeded the threshold ( 60 % of gdp ) established through the stability and growth pact .
colombo – sri lanka was deservedly praised for the progress it made since the end of the war against the separatist tamil tigers in 2009 . the economy grew at an average annual rate of 6.7 % on average , and the statistics of education and health are impressive . all developing countries are facing myriad challenges , but this is especially the case for a country that has suffered an intensive thirty years ’ civil war . governments will need to fix priorities ; but success will require a comprehensive approach . underlying wars like the fighting with the tamil tigers , typically , social and economic grievances like actual or perceived discrimination and government failure to address wealth and income disparities adequately .
the western democracies , as most historians now admit , played a comparatively minor role in the great military struggle . the pope believed either he could condemn both totalitarian powers , or had they condemned neither . but any denunciation by pius of communism would have exploited nazi propaganda as support for hitler ’s war-effort . and the denunciation of nazism might have been misinterpreted as an attack not against nazism , but against germany in its life-and-death struggle against stalin ’s communist regime . very few people at the vatican – indeed , in europe at great – had any real knowledge in those days of the great industrial might of the united states .
the data driving instantaneously worldwide are indifferent to national boundaries . i am convinced that the economic and social effects of such data will rival even surpasses that of petroleum and the internal-combustion engine that played in the twentieth century . by its nature , data easily overcomes physical constraints . networked , its effects and advantages multiply , and then multiply further . conversely , should the equivalent of even a single closed-off room appear anywhere , the resulting losses extend to the entire network .
serious trade reform , meanwhile , did not begin until 1991-93 . governments in both countries had focused excessively on scarce political capital and administrative resources on areas other than on trade liberalization . because both india and china experienced sharp increases in trade substantially , both are regarded as globalizers by the criterion of the world bank . but , as their experience reveals -- together with those experience in many others like south korea , singapore , taiwan , and vietnam -- deep trade liberalization hardly seems a factor in spurring higher growth and broad-based free trade . it is good to see the world bank catching on to this straightforward reality .
feeling the sort of prodigious , restless power that i suspected it could not have turned off had it wanted to . early on , i felt that the request was a test – one that i was prepared to take , as i conducted my observation with me in forward , air-control aircraft . he seemed deeply engaged , but made no comment , asked me only whether i had anything in writing . i said i did , but that it was in longhand . he suggested that i produce a typed copy .
at present , these types of innovations are not featured prominently in most hunger-happy strategies . but that is changing slowly , particularly as more people in emerging economies link to mobile networks , with apps designed to collect and share agricultural information becoming more widely available . in egypt , for example , sudan , and ethiopia , local extension services are bringing real-time weather data into vegetable farmers through sms . in west africa , private companies like ignitia are expanding the accuracy and precision of sms weather alerts to distant farmers . in mongolia , rural herdders are finding information on disease outbreaks to help them sustain their animal health .
brussels – as the world ’s financial elite converges on washington , dc , to the annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank , they can not get away with yet another honored call to roll back the retreat of globalization . faltering trade is supposed to be the adverse trend . but the premise is simplistic at best . the problem lies in the lack of understanding of what drove the growth of trade in commerce in recent decades . to be sure , efforts have been made to grasp the current slowdown .
finally , a renminbi-depreciation policy would lead to a sharp escalation in the global currency war . during an era of unprecedented quantitative easing , competitive currency devaluation became the norm for major global exporters – first the american people , then japan , and now europe . had china joined this race to the bottom , others would have been tempted to escalate their actions , and global financial markets have been subject to yet another source of severe instability . just as china withstood the temptation of renminbi depreciation during the asian financial crisis of 1997-98 – a decision that may well have played a pivotal role in arresting regional contagion – needs to stay the course today . that is all the more relevant in a disorderly climate of qe , where china ’s role as an international currency anchor may take even greater significance than it did in the late 1990s .
and , even if fiscal policymakers were to become more responsive , they would start out of the question of relatively high deficits and debt . prolonging the current expansion will require taking great care . policymakers , particularly in the us congress , need to avoid big mistakes and minimize the risk of market crashes , while doing more to support growth . the us needs a well-targeted approach to modernizing and upgrading its infrastructure . likewise , policymakers and business leaders need to be more sensitive to how the fruits of economic growth are shared ; better protections for the most vulnerable segments of society and stronger automatic stabilizers .
for many years , the imf has engaged its member countries in a process known as “ surveillance , ” in which tracing , analyzes , and consults on every country ’s economic policies – both exchange-rate policies and relevant domestic policies . these regular checkups are helping to identify potential vulnerability and sustain economic stability . nevertheless , the increasingly complex policy challenges of a globalizing economy are demanding a fresh look at the process . this june , the imf ’s executive board did just that , reaching a broad consensus on updating to make it more focused and efficient . this is one of the most significant reforms to the fund ’s workweek in the 30 years since the surveillance process was designed .
four measures are needed to achieve this . first , there is a need for a debt conference , with the creditors of southern european governments and banks forging a portion of their debt . the creditors relinquishing part of their claims must include public entities , first and foremost the ecb , that has now largely replaced private-sector lenders . second , eurozone members , whose path to regaining competitiveness through prices and wages reduction , are too long and grueling , and whose societies risk being swamped by the necessary imposition of austerity , must temporarily an exit the monetary union . exiting the pain of exiting should bear in the face of communal financial assistance that would not be necessary for long , because a new currency devaluation would quickly restore competitiveness .
this matters , because ukraine has only partly met the imf agreement it signed in 1994 , 2008 , and 2010 . finally , the eu should insist that ukraine halt all the politically motivated criminal cases , freeing those who are incarcerated for political crimes . selective use of justice has done badly to damage the yanukovych administration ’s reputation . steps in this direction would vastly improve ukraine ’s government ’s relations with the eu and the american people . these three steps would not resolve all difficulties in ukraine .
arguing that his efforts at improving relations with russia are in america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s national interest , trump , shortly after the summit , had invited putin to visit the white house in the near term . putin has just reciprocated with an invitation for trump to come to the kremlin . but trump ’s enthusiasm ( and his desire to defy his critics ) is no substitute for genuine openness to mutually beneficial cooperation , like that saw in 1959 , when dwight eisenhower invited nikita khrushchev to visit the us , and again in 1986 , when mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan met in reykjavík . instead , trump ’s actions seem like more kowtowing to the hackles of other american leaders . for many members of america ’s security establishment , putin ’s apparent leverage over trump poses an existential threat to american democracy , much as the soviet union did at the height of the cold war .
washington , dc – this month , europe ’s citizens head to the polls to elect the 751 members of the european parliament to represent 507 million people . the manner in which the election campaign unfolded marks a small but significant step in stemming the first supranational political space in european – indeed , world – of history . to be sure , european parliament elections brought smaller shares of voters back to the polls : 43 % in 2009 , compared to nearly 60 % in 1978-1994 . meanwhile , the participation rate over the past decade is comparable to an average turnout in the american congressional elections . given the perceived remoteness of the european parliament , and widespread frustration with the european union ’s bureaucracy , the level of participation and movement toward supranational politics , is notable .
the bombing , however , was not incased in metal , and terrorist was the only person killed . to an outsider , the episode looks like a colossal security failure , as if the head of the fbi had personally greeted one of bin laden 's ’s ’s ’s lieutenants at his garden party . but it is only this highly personalized form of policies adopted by the saudi royals with defecting al-qaeda ’s members . indeed , that policy , even with its risks , partly explains al-qaeda ’s defeat in saudi arabia . highly personalized politics forms part of what might be called saudi arabia ’s churn of state that keeps the royals firmly in power .
it used to be prime minister levi eshkol that she spoke seven languages , all in yiddish . of eshka might say that she spoke ten languages and all of them with an oxford/cambridge accent . still , what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of israeli politics . perhaps eban was too urbane , too much of a scholar and gentlemen ’s power – in disraeli ’s phrase – to the summit of greasy . together with golda meir and moshe dayan , he was forced to leave government in 1974 in the yom kippur war .
but whether europe as an entire avoids decades of economic growth still hangs in its balance , and depends on whether southern european governments can regain rapid competitiveness fast . the process by which southern europe became initially uncompetitive was driven by market price signals – through incentives for those signals created for entrepreneurs , and by how entrepreneurs ’ individually rational response played out in macroeconomic terms . northern europeans with money to invest were willing to lend at extraordinarily easy terms to those in the south who wanted to spend , and ample pre-2007 expenditure made employers willing to raise wages fast . as a result , southern europeans adopted the economic configuration in which their wages , prices , and productivity levels made sense only so long as they spent € 13 on each € 12 that it earned , with northern europeans financing a missing euro . northern europeans , meanwhile , adopted wage and productivity levels that made sense only as long as they spent less than one europe on every euro that it earned .
a worldwide economic downturn is the last thing that the world needs at a time when it is already beset by risks , including possible no-deal brexit and populist gains in may ’s european parliament election . of course , while trump does not spare his allies , his primary target remains that of china . after all , competition between the us and china extends far beyond trade . though the us maintains militarily , technological , financial , and soft-power supremacy , china was steadily catching up , leading to bipartisan support in the us for a more confrontational approach . last october , us vice presidential candidate mike pence bluntly accused china of engaging in technology theft , predatory economic expansion , and military aggression .
they can be answered , and periodically through an iterative process of strategic interactions between public agencies and private firms . a common theme that emerges from studies of so-called place-based policies , such as regionally targeted employment subsidies and infrastructure investment , is the heavily contingent nature of success . few policies work out a shelf and reliably through a variety of diverse settings . competitions among states and localities to attract large employers with tax and other subsidies work especially poorly . recent high-profile deals for foxconn and amazon , in wisconsin and new york respectively , blow up .
shanghai – china faces the hard task of managing a soft economic landing after decades of spectacular expansions . naysayers abound , but never really mind them . china has the advantage that other countries in today ’s troubled global economy lack : a clear path forward . if china performs a sustained , comprehensive commitment to raising productivity , it can address its growth challenges , reduce the risks of the financial crisis , and complete its shift to a consumption-driven , high-income economy with a large and affluent middle class . if it does , its annual gdp could be an estimated $ 5 trillion greater by 2030 than it is probably if policymakers continue to pursue investment-led growth .
london – as governments across western europe started bailing out banks and their depositors , east europeans watched nervously , uncertain about what would mean for them . now that the storm has hit , europe ’s fragile bonds of european solidarity are being put to the test . two countries – hungary and ukraine – have already asked for big support packages . several more could have done this next month , if frozen credit markets are no thaw . if things continue until the end of a year that can not be excluded , many more countries could experience severe banking crises .
but the big question for health professionals is whether the quantity or quality of foods is really to blame . this is an important distinction , because quantity is determined by the user , whereas quality is determined by the industry . some health experts argue that particular components of processed foods – notably , sugar – are as addictive as cocaine and heroin . sugar , for example , is consistently an ingredient with the top score on the yale food dependence scale , which measures people ’s food cravings . the processed food industry argues , “ you need the sugar to live .
a tightly coordinated effort amongst the private sector and the public sector partners to deliver an oral polio vaccine to every child under five was the key to success . globally , international donors and un agencies have worked closely with national governments , revisit the precise needs of massive polio immunization campaigns focused on reaching hundreds of millions of children . last year alone , the world health eradication initiative delivered nearly two billion polio vaccine doses to 575 million children in 94 countries alone . in every country , partner institutions including health secretary , the world health organization , unicef , other un agencies , service groups such as rotary international , representatives from donor governments , private-sector agencies , and non-governmental organizations , jointly , and cautiously planned each immunization campaign . every detail , from the volume of bicycles and boats needed to deliver vaccines to otherwise inaccessible areas , to refrigerators and cool boxes needed to keep the vaccine potent , even the batteries needed to power them have been counted and budgeted .
in an increasingly deal-based world , a new g6 could offer a defense of a rules-based system . still , one wonders if the eu manages to place a united front . with the bloc splintering into distinct political tribes , it becomes easier for other powers to pursue a divide-and-conquer strategy . this has long been russia ’s strategy , and it is embraced by china and the us alike . in 2016 , for example , southern and east eu member states that relied on chinese investment managed to irrigate a joint eu statement on china ’s territorial encroachments in the south china sea .
corruption is one of africa ’s endemic problems . indeed , it is a key issue in nigeria ’s approaching presidential election , given president olusegun obasanjo ’s high but unsuccessful struggle to curb it . but the headwinds from globalization were intended to blow the cobwebs off from bribery and inefficiencies . harvard political scientist deputy kapur suggests why this does not take place . evict the state from direct economic activity , curb its own discretionary powers , and both economic efficiency and governance will improve .
florence – europeans , anxious to revive the continent ’s ’s unification process , have lately been turning their spotlight on the founding of the united states . many , however , reject the american precedent on the ground that today ’s problems are too dissimilar from those encountered then . still others , accepting that federalist principles might well be comfortable addressing europe ’s common market problems , despair that europe ’s “ “ “ “ “ europe ” people ” who might bring about this new political edifice . but there are striking parallels between america ’s founding years and europe ’s current ongoing political and economic crisis . in fact , by establishing the american constitution and the birth of the american people , the europeans offer reasons for hope that some of the toughest issues facing europe may one day be addressed .
moscow – ongoing street protests in hong kong and moscow are no doubt spooked by the authoritarian duo of chinese president xi jinping and russian president vladimir putin . moscow ’s protests , the largest in many years , must hold putin up at night or avoid dispersed with such unabated brutality . yet , rather than hold a dialogue with the people , putin has shown himself to be in control , even pretenses for pictures in tight leather outfits with his favorite motorcycle gang . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
the next year , the persian emperor , yazdegerd iii , fled to the frontier province of khorasan and arabization of persia began , with persians taking arab names and shifting to islam . by 651 , almost all of the major urban centers in persia were brought under arab control , adding momentum to the process . the mass conversion to islam among persians was a first step toward establishing a first caliphate , a political-religious state that includes all of the muslim lands . at various times in history , the caliphates have extended across asia , africa , and parts of europe . efforts by different forces seeking to control or rebuild the caliphate are a recurrent theme throughout islam ’s history .
the russian government ’s reluctance to fight corruption and bolster the country ’s ’s legal institutions reflects a perverse – yet stable – political equilibrium . in 2010 , tsyvinski and i predicted a 70-80 scenario ” in russia in the coming years : just as oil prices , which had plummeted to $ 40 per barrel ; recovered and surpassed $ 70-80 / barrel ; russia would return to the stagflation of the 1970s and 1980 ’s . sure enough , gdp growth from 2010 to 2012 , although averaging an astonishing 4 % , turned out to have been fueled by a post-crisis recovery and an additional spike in oil prices to $ 100/barrel . now all of these short-term factors have been depleted , and an brezhnev-like period of stagnation has begun . russia ’s political elite understands that the economy is capable of 5-6 % annual growth .
left-wing proponents of so-called “ modern monetary theory ” argue that larger , more permanent fiscal deficits are sustainable when monetized during times of economic slack because there is little risk of runaway inflation . following this reasoning , in the uk , the labour party has proposed a “ “ people ” of qe , ” whereby the central bank would print money to finance outright fiscal transfers to households rather than to bankers and investors . others , including mainstream economists like adair turner , former chairman of the uk financial-services authority , have called for “ helicopter drops ” : direct cash transfers to consumers through central-bank-financed fiscal deficits . still others , such as former fed vice chair stanley fischer and his colleagues at blackrock , have proposed a “ standing emergency fiscal facility ” ” ” ” ” ” that would enable the central bank to finance large fiscal deficits when a deep recession hits . notwithstanding terminology differences , all of these proposals are variants of the same idea : large fiscal deficits monetized by central banks should be used to stimulate aggregate demand in the event of another slump .
most developing countries , which i know , are spending too little money devising good projects . when the private sector does , transforming its ideas into bankable projects is often extremely difficult , because many difficult-to-coordinate public-sector choices or steps are involved . so , let ’s presume that a toll road project is being approved , a concession deal is ready , and companies offer it . bidders need a five-year plan for two phases : engineering , procurement , building ( epc ) , and phased phases when toll revenues are accumulated to recover incurred costs and expected returns . there are plenty of uncertainties in both phases , but particularly during the epc that may last 3-7 years , depending on the project .
besides , there is a clear business rationale for prioritizing the green finance.investors and rating agencies increasingly scrutinizing investment portfolios for potentially “ stranded assets , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” such as oil - and gas projects that will become outdated as more renewable-energy technologies become commercially viable . many existing fossil-fuel projects already have shorter life spans than were previously expected , with financial portfolios relying heavily on such assets increasingly at risk of devaluation . with some governments abandoning previous emissions-reduction pledges , one might think that the global effort to combat climate change is losing steam . but we should not underestimate the force of financial pressure to effect change ; nor can we ignore the determination of local governments and the private sector to act where national governments do not . nonetheless , to get and hold all governments on board , low-carbon transitions must be inclusive .
to defend “ family values ” , whatever that means . more recently , a group of parliamentarians ( quite large enough on parliament ) left a majority of post-solidarity party , and formed a new “ polish family ” party with the slogan that the ruling coalition is in “ the service of brussels . ” a less agressive anti-europeanism comes from a tendencies that struggles for old values like honor and virtue . in practical terms , this movement also tends to motivate little more than fear of change . but here people , acting in the former “ solidarity ” movement – for them a community movement and not of individuals , a movement for public rather than private freedom – form a new bloc of euro-antagonists .
that may be part of the story , but competition for consumer talent and customers seems intense between investment banks and others , yet they have been collectively extravagantly rewarded at the expense of these customers . an alternative hypothesis that seems comfortable with facts recently emerged recently from paul woolley ’s center for study of dysfunctionality in capital markets at the london school of economics . the researchers there argue that in fragile , speculative industries ( and finance has certainly been in that category over the last few years ) , it is hard for investors to monitor those managing their money . they may see short-term returns , but they have little understanding of how those returns are generated . managers can demand higher and higher returns in a downward upturn .
the united nations is consistently ranked among the top ten countries for innovation , including by the insead ’s ’s ’s worldwide innovation index . yet , on the global peace index , it ranked 88th out of 153 countries worldwide . likewise , the united kingdom and the netherlands rank , respectively , one-fifth , and sixth on the innovation index , but just 28th and 29th , on their peace index . conversely , bhutan ranks among the top 20 most peaceful nations , but does not even make it onto innovation indices . to be sure , crime , terrorism , conflict , and political instability are severe enough to bring about a complete breakdown of law and order substantially hamper creativity and innovation .
but merkel still defected to weber , and , in addition to macron and dutch prime minister mark rutte , most eu leaders remain reluctant to confront the european parliament on the spitzenkandidaten issue . that may shorten the odds for margrethe vestager – coming not from the epp , but who is feeling the liberal spitzenkandidat while completing them to michel barnier outside the epp but is not spitzenkandidat . if the council succeeds in ruling out weber and his populist supporters , macron will argue for this as an achievement . ultimately , the election provides a check on german hegemony within the eu more broadly . germany ’s christian democratic union ( cdu ) has been weakened .
on january 1 , 2007 , ban ki-moon , south korea ’s former foreign minister , will become united nations secretary general , following kofi annan ’s ten-year tenure . annan has inspired the world with his diplomacy and management for poverty reduction and human rights , but the war in iraq has divided the world , drawing attention and financial resources away from crisis regions and critical long-term issues , such as climate change , disease control , sustainable energy , and access to water . with the recent elections in the united states and the rise of asia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s global sphere of influence , an opportunity exists to turn the world into one of the most critical challenges facing our planet . beyond the longstanding challenges of poverty , environmental , nuclear proliferation , and un reform , the new secretary-general will inherit a long list of hotspots : iraq , iran , afghanistan , palestine , lebanon , somalia , myanmar , sudan , north korea , and elsewhere . recent attempts at impact developments in these countries through threat and sanctions , and at times of war , have failed .
this is why a catastrophic free-for-all in us trade policy during the 1930 ’s greatly aggravated the great depression . many complain that something similar , if less spectacular in scope is taking place today . an outfit , called the world trade alert ( gta ) at the forefront , has raised alarm bells about what it calls a “ protectionist juggernaut . ” gta ’s most recent report identifies no fewer than 192 separate protectionist actions since november 2008 , with china as its most common target . that number has been widely cited in the us , where the financial press has come out .
if people come into a country to earn higher wages , the pie available for redistribution gets larger ; but if they come for socioeconomic benefits , the pie gets smaller . given this , why not have a system in which host countries and countries alike share the welfare costs of migrants ? host countries could assume responsibility for administering benefits like unemployment insurance , keeping sick pay , and pension earnings . and countries of origin could continue to provide the labor-related benefits , such as child allowances , staying at home , and service to those who are too old or sick to work as they arrive . such a change would create win-win conditions for the eu because it would minimize the destructive appeal of welfare magnetism and give the british grounds to rethink its exit decisions with its head held high .
for a long time , what needs to be done has been clear . the price of a monetary union ’s survival , in turn , is more a community : a banking union , a fiscal union , and a political union . those who oppose this because it fears common accountability , transfers from the rich to the poor , and the loss of national sovereignty will have to embrace european re-nationalization – and thus its exit from the global scene . no alternative – and certainly no statusquo – will at work . it has become common knowledge in europe that the ongoing crisis either destroys the eu or brings about a political union ; and , lacking solidarity-based solutions to existing debt and partial mutualization of new debt , europe can not save itself .
the eu is not deprived of tools – the so-called “ “ structural funds ” that fund investment in poorer regions but have no strategy for using them . so the outcome of months of discussion might well be better characterized as a “ “ emu 1.7.3 ” than “ emu 2.0 . ” more bugs will need to be fixed , including new bugs found in fixes . for investors , the reform process might seem impossibly long and hesitancy . but , by standards in international negotiations and european governance , it has produced exceptionally fast .
though educational opportunities and structures have gradually diversified , important shortcoming remains : students have too few choices , and teachers , if they want to remain in occupations , must adhere to severely compartmentalized pedagogy . as with corporate monopolies , consumers ( students ) often see themselves as a homogeneous mass where all students can be educated on the basis of the same pedagogical approach . but schools need to meet the needs and capabilities of individual children in ways that make learning a stimulating adventure . other countries might find sweden ’s system worth studying . their schools fund local communities and work within the framework of the national curriculum proposed by the parliament and the government .
from this moment , they are in and out of a prison system , and have little chance of ever regaining a legal job that provides ample reason for them to escape poverty . their children grow without parents at home – and without hope and support . children of drug users often become drug users themselves ; too , frequently ends up in jail or suffer violence or early death . what is crazy about this is that the american missed an obvious point – and has missed it for 40 years . to break the poverty cycle , a country needs investment in its children ’s future , rather than in the incarceration of 2.3 million people every year , many for nonviolent offenses that show symptoms of poverty .
the non-residential construction boom this created helped not only to absorb the labor force leaving rural areas , but also to achieve a spectacular reduction in inequality . within this services-export-led growth strategy , skill shortages did not turn into a major problem , owing to the reasonably open immigration policy that allowed the country to exploit the talents that colombia , among other countries , had been unable to contain . the comparison between the two approaches is unmistakable . colombia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s policymakers were hoping that if they enact the best-practice laws and regulation , somebody would come . and , if they do n’t , they might still bask in an international accolades that they receive from foreign entities .
moreover , there is now massive re-leveraging of public-sector deleveraging in the advanced economies , with huge budget deficits and public-debt accumulation driven by automatic stabilizers , countercyclical keynesian fiscal stimulus , and an enormous cost to socializing the financial system ’s losses . at best , we are facing a protracted period of anemic , below-trend growth in advanced economies like deleveraging by households , financial institutions , and governments are beginning to feed through toward consumption and investment . at the global level , the countries that spent too little – the united states , the united kingdom , spain , greece , and elsewhere – now need to deleverage and spend , consuming , importing less . but over-saving countries – china , emerging asia , germany , and japan – are not spending more to compensate for falling spending by deleveraging countries . reviving global aggregate demand will therefore prove weak , pushing global growth far lower .
the current crisis , the fall of wall street , is to repeat the neo-liberalism of the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . the global dimension of this crisis , unsurprisingly , has a positive side as well . the international community is now charged with thinking about how to reform the financial sector and minimize the risk of similar disaster in the future . until now , a major part of the problem was ’ ’ ’ commitment to cooperation . earlier demands for tighter regulation came to nothing , owing to the financial sector ’s opposition .
just as importantly , the liberal state should be neutral on such matters , leaving it to every citizen to determine whether it should give away its financial support to the church of rome or one at bayreuth . in contrast to the militant liberalism of the french tradition , this neutralist , liberal philosophy strives to prevent either side from taking sides in the ongoing culture war from using state-coercive powers of taxation as a weapon in the struggle for the souls of men . in advocating the disestablishment of both religious and secular orthodoxies , i do not wish to trivialize the importance of their ongoing contest over the meaning of life . it is because of the infinite importance of this grand discourse that the state should strive to be neutral . after all , when an state ostentatiously take sides in this conversation , it can not avoid denigrating the ultimate convictions of many of its dissenting citizens .
new york – twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of communism , the world confronts another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization : international capitalism and state capitalism . a former , represented by the united states , broke down , with the latter represented by china on the rise . following the path of least resistance , the international financial system ’s gradual disintegration will lead to the international financial system ’s gradual disintegration . a new , twentieth-century multilateral system must be invented . while international cooperation on regulatory reform makes it difficult to achieve on piecemeal basis , it may well be attainable in a grand bargain restoring the entire financial order .
mario monti , italy ’s european union commissioner for competition policy , is often in the spotlight , typically to popular acclaim . over the years , italy has won important victories restricting state aid to entrepreneurship , one of europe ’s most pernicious economic maladies . today , however , the benefits derived from its accomplishments are at risk , owing to a plethora of stunning courtroom defeats . with the software giant microsoft seemingly in the offing , monti will need to rediscover his footing fast . within a period of just a couple of weeks , the european court of justice ( to which private parties can appeal to the commission ’s decisions ) voided three of monti ’s decisions in rejecting proposed corporate mergers .
so many proud and dignified people were stripped of their livelihoods and forced upon them to rely on one tiny food per day or nothing at all . worse still , these tragedies were thoroughly disproved ; we recognized these crises . droughts and hunger slow-motion calamities that , with adequate planning and sufficient resources , can be averted . yet , again , time and time , humanitarian aid in africa came short , as it did in somalia in 2011 and 2012 ; in niger in 2005 ; and in ethiopia during the 1980s . then , as now , food insecurity was forestalled long before its first hunger pangs felt .
the bottom chessboard includes supranational relationships that cross borders beyond the control of governments – everything from drugs to infectious disease to climate change to cyber-terrorism . on this board , power is chaotically distributed among non-state actors . no government can dominate outcomes without the cooperation of others . here the american people need help , and it makes no sense to call this “ uni-polar ” world either . on this bottom board , there is also an important degree of close civilian cooperation that affects a country ’s attractiveness or soft power .
the translation : the orderly resolution of global megabanks is an illusion . as long as we allow cross-border banks at or near their present level , our political leaders will be unable to tolerate their failure . and , because these large financial institutions operate by any reasonable definition “ too big to fail , ” ” they can borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case . making matters worse , they have both a motive and a chance to grow even bigger . that form of government support amounts to a massive implicit subsidy for the big banks .
and , by raising the costs of extracting fossil-fuel-based fuels , it would contribute to the eventual phase-out of an already-secure sector . fortunately , the world will not need to await the moral suasion to bear the day . meanwhile , fossil-fuel companies and governments are already facing intensifying legal pressure . typhoon survivors in the philippines have conveyed their complaint with the country ’s united nations human rights commission , calling for an inquiry into big fossil-fuel companies ’ responsibility for causing climate change . dutch group urgenda and almost 900 co-prosecutors have successfully sued the dutch government , forcing it to adopt tougher climate policies .
several years ago , for example , chip-maker national semiconductor managed a complicated delivery system connecting its three factories and three subcontractors in asia to its worldwide customer network . it decided to out-source that operation to a federal voice , using a sophisticated on-line system for managing global deliveries and sales . as a result , the national semiconductor saw its delivery cycle to cut off customers from four weeks to a single week , and the distribution cost cut from 2.9 % of sales to 1.2 % . several steps are needed to encourage a massive increase in internet use in these other locations : * liberalization of telecoms , including the entry of new private service providers , is crucial for reducing costs and spreading benefits .
as long as governments run larger fiscal deficits and finance this not with interest-bearing debt , but with central-bank money acts as a way to combat nominal demand , producing some mix of higher inflation and higher real output . as a result , the alternative of so-called “ “ helicopter money ” to pursue economic growth is becoming more intense . nonetheless , the debate over it is riddled with confusions . it is often argued that monetizing fiscal deficits would commit central banks to keeping interest rates low forever , an approach that is bound to generate excessive inflation . it is simultaneously argued ( sometimes the same thing ) that monetary finance would not stimulate demand , because people will fear a future “ inflationary ” tax .
geneva – when lehman brothers declared bankruptcy ten years ago , it suddenly became unclear who owed what to whom , having been able to repay greece ’s debts and whom it would go down next . the result was that interbank credit markets froze , wall street panicked , and firms went under , not only in the united states but around the world . with policymakers struggling to respond to the crisis , economic pundits were left wondering whether the “ great moderation ” of low business-cycle volatility since the 1980s had turned into another great depression . in hindsight , complacency about the run-up to the crisis was apparently unconsciences . and yet , in its aftermath , little did change .
coalition partners disagree on how urgent to sort out this question . nonetheless , they have agreed that , in less than a year , a commission would grant different options and models to protect germany ’s parliament ’s rights , while at the same time providing assurances to germany ’s ’s ’s ’s european partners that the country would be a robust contributor to troop deployments . should the spd , which will vote on a coalition agreement in early december , block the formation of a new government ( an unlikely development but not completely off the issue ) , disputes over security and defense matters would not be the culprit . a couple of minor particulars aside , consensus prevails . for some , that is fueling ambivalence .
badly needed biosafety legislation in nigeria and uganda , for example , has already gone behind . much of the issue lies with a small team of anti-gm activists who object to the technologies on “ moral ” grounds . they typically argue that gm crops are unsafe – a view flatly rejected by the scientific community over the past two decades . likewise , the world health organization has acknowledged that “ no effects on human health ” have been shown as a result of consumption of such foods . indeed , every new gm crop variety must meet rigorous health , ecological , and efficacy standards .
perhaps regulators will find that they need to require that the regulated have the provisions of desired contracts . that solution will be incomplete , however , because not all derivatives traders are closely regulated financial institutions , and because many lenders would find ways to circumvent the contract and the requirement . when coverage is not complete , one can expect the regulated to complain that they were placed at a competitive disadvantage . regulators may well need to turn over to bankruptcy laws to fix the problem . regulators ’ call for voluntary action will not amount to much if it merely requires that the derivatives industry act against its own financial interests .
the outcome was section 124a of the penal code under which each person who used “ words , signs , or visible representation ” … to excite disaffection against the government ’s ” can charges of sedition and potentially condemned to life imprisonment . in other words , no free speech for indians could have been made permanent . but even that was inadequate to britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders , who tightened the law further in 1898 , makes it even harsher than sedition laws in england . the british had concluded in the words of a british lieutenant governor of bengal , that “ sedition laws ” adequate to a person ruled by a nationality and belief can be deficient or , in some respects , unsuited to a country under foreign rule . sedition thus stood explicitly as an instrument to terrorize indian nationalists ; indeed , mahatma gandhi was among its prominent victims , albeit far from its last .
seoul – china – already the world ’s largest exporter , manufacturer , and a international-reserve-holder – is poised to overtake the united states as the world ’s largest economy ( as measured by purchasing power parity ) this year . now it uses its growing clout to reshape global economic governance . indeed , the country ’s era ’s following deng xiaoping ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s injunction to “ hidden brightness and an cherish obscurity ” is long gone . after decades of actively participating in international economic institutions – including the g20 , the international monetary fund , the world bank , and the world trade organization – china began to resemble a revisionist power seeking to forge a new world order . last month , china and 20 other asian countries signed the memorandum of understanding to establish a new multilateral development bank , the asian infrastructure investment bank ( aiib ) .
in fact , progress on the single market has helped foster competitiveness . new free-trade agreements give europe ’s economies access to major markets worldwide . achieving a global climate agreement promises not only to protect the environment , but also to cement europe ’s role as an sustainability leader . and eu enlargement has enhanced europe ’s security substantially . these are , by all reasonable standards , remarkable uk-led achievements .
a special report on semiconductors – vital to american national security and economic competitiveness – for president barack obama ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s council of science and technology advice ( pcast ) gives some answers . the message , written by an nonpartisan group of business and academic leaders ( i was a member ) , has proposed that america work with its nato allies to enforce international law , press china to comply with its world trade organization obligations , and to strengthen export controls and inward investment restrictions . the european union , japan , south korea , and taiwan all have prominent roles in the global supply chain for semiconductors , and some have already tightened security on the flow of semiconductor ip to china , as well as to acquisitions of us semiconductor firms by chinese investors . the pcast ’s report recommends adopting similar tactics , calibrating export controls , and inward investment limits according to china ’s own behavior . proposed bipartisan legislation to expand the jurisdiction of america ’s foreign-investment committee ( which reviews and acquisitions of domestic companies through foreign entities ) to a broader range of investment , including chinese venture-capital and private-equity investments in american startups – fits this recommendation .
business-led innovation and market-based solutions can drive a decisive global shift from crippling fossil-fuel dependency to more fuel-efficient renewable-energy systems . rocky mountain institute ’s reinventing wildlife-analysis shows that such a future is possible , offering a market-driven strategies for powering the american economy that is 158 % larger in 2050 – without reliance on oil , coal , or nuclear energy . swift and determined action to make buildings more energy-efficient , design automobiles that require little or no fossil fuel , and raise the proportion of renewables in electricity supply could ensure a substantially hotter , less pleasant world of 2050 that the ipcc warns against not materialize . our livelihoods , not to mention those of future generations , should not be held hostage to our ongoing dependence on fossil fuels . four decades ago , countries not only endured the imminent economic impact of opec ’s embargoes ; they leveraged the potential of the resulting oil shortages to spur innovation .
the captured uranium was not weapons-grade ; international inspectors removed all of the sensitive materials from iraq following the 1991 gulf war ( thus why it was absent when the united states invaded in 2003 ) . but what an international response , if any , would have been triggered if the cache was highly enriched ? by the same day , hamas had launched three powerful , iranian-designed rockets from gaza at israel ’s dimona reactor . luckily , two had missed the target , and israel had managed to intercept a third . but the episode represented a severe escalation of hostilities , serving as an important reminder of the vulnerability of nuclear reactors in warzones .
while dollar appreciation has pushed some downward pressure on non-us economies , which depend on us exports or foreign capital , has raised the risk of an gaping currency war . at the same time , not all of the indicators are gloomy . labor markets remain largely sound , even in otherwise anemic economies like germany , and household consumption remains strong in most major economies . moreover , the september credit boom , which raised fears of another negative growth shock , has since burst . america ’s economy reflects this dichotomy .
in personal-computing business , which moved from apple ii to the sleek and smart iphone 4s ( announced a day before steve death ) , steve was the only true showman of what is now one of the world ’s largest industries . he inspired broad public enthusiasm for the quality of his products and his personal charisma . ( others became “ business ” leaders , but only steve was known and admired by millions – including the romanian waiter at british airways where i sit now . ) i first met with hegel back in 1979 or 1980 at the personal computer forum of ben rosen . for some reason , it was held to the playboy resort in lake geneva ( never again ! ) .
cambridge – america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s real gdp growth rate of 3.2 % for the first quarter of this year is impressive , as was the 3 % average growth in 2018 ( measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 ) . from the end of the great recession – from 2011 to 2017 – the american economy has grown at a mere 2.1 % annual rate per year , on average . so , what accounts for the recent upturn ? following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
in closed-list systems , candidate listens should be zippered : male , women-women-owned , women-owned , ( or vice versa ) . in open-list systems , a 50 % quota should be adopted in open-list systems . there is no way to predict any accuracy of the impact of the rising quota percentages within the open-list systems that currently have an effective quota legislation . but if these countries replace open lists with close lists , the percentage of women elected should , all other than the rest , rise to around 10 % . the impact would be greatest ( the resulting number of women elected ) in systems that currently lack effective quota legislation .
trump systematically defied the separation of powers at the heart of america ’s constitutional system . for example , frustrated that the us congress had denied him all the funds it wanted for its phantasmagorical wall along its border with mexico , he simply plucked the money from funds that the us congress allocated to the department of defense . he also flouted the constitutional prohibition of accepting emoluments – money or personal gain by foreign governments doing business , sometimes by extravagant share , at his various hotels and golf clubs , and found other ways to monetize the presidency . moreover , trump has sought to steer government contracts toward favored companies or away from those it dislikes – for example , amazon , whose co-founder , jeff bezos , also owns the washington post . and , according to special counsel robert mueller ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s report , trump has sought to obstruct the investigations into his 2016 campaign ’s investigation into his 2016 dealings with russia .
when debt becomes unsustainable , there are several potential bargaining outcomes . sometimes debt-service payments are rescheduled and perhaps stretched out over a longer period , thus giving the debtor country time to recapture its paying capacity . sometimes , lenders agree to exchange old bonds for newly minted ones , which have either low-face value or lower interest payments . few governments refuse to pay at all , in any form . argentina defaulted on its debt in 2001 .
this ‘ tipping point ’ strategy is extremely cost-effective , so that it can help . a strategy , however , can be “ “ cost-effective ” only when it is achievable . while ring prophylaxis might work in minneapolis , toronto , or zurich , in parts of a world where flu pandemics start , the probability of success approaches zero . in places like vietnam , indonesia , and china , where a strain of pandemic is likely to originate – through expertise , coordination , discipline , and infrastructure . the response in turkey , where as many as 50 potential cases have appeared in eastern ukraine , is instructive .
it remains the vital assembly center of the global supply chain for many manufactured goods , such as computers and cellular telephony , that can lower prices for world consumers . that has made china an essential trade partner for the united states , most european countries , and many other economies besides having it at the center of intra-asian trade and supply-chain dynamics . moreover , china sits on roughly $ 3.3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves – much of it in dollars , but also in other major currencies – owing to its large trade surplus with the us in recent decades . it helps to finance other countries ’ trade deficits and domestic investment ( many of its beneficiaries hold large budget deficits that have fallen national saving rates below domestic investment ) . deng xiaoping ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s reforms , ignited the most rapid economic improvements in human history , and with it , the emergence of a large and growing middle class .
for ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s government , the angst are real . even ukrainians born after 1986 understand what the chernobyl-type disaster brought about by battle might look like . history offers little guidance about whether warring countries would avoid damaging nuclear sites . except for the 1990 ’s of the balkan conflict , wars were neither fought nor in countries with nuclear reactors . in the balkan case , serbian military jets overflew slovenia ’s krško nuclear power looms in a threatening gesture early in the conflict , while radical serbian nationalists called for attacks to unleash their radioactive contents .
china captured the kremlin ’s full advantage of its desperation , securing rock-bottom tariffs on russian energy resources . once its doors to asia were opened , however , russian companies seized the opportunity to enter india ’s downstream markets and indonesia – two countries that are critical to the saudis ’ own strategy . over the past two years , or so , saudi arabia has made it clear that it will not easily give up its market share – – to anyone . it has pursued a campaign to reclaim its former standing not only in crude , but also in petroleum products , natural gas beats , and petrochemicals . to this end , it has sustained a price war , backed by a surge in production aimed at compressing its weaker competitors .
indeed , attaining , prospering , and flourishing all refer to experiential rewards , rather than to money . what kind of economy would offer this good life ? history suggests that it would be one of entrepreneurial people ( alert to unnoticed opportunities , and exercising their initiative to try out novel things ) and innovative people ( imagining new things , developing new concepts into commercial products and methods , and marketing them to potential ) . participants in such a good economy would range from grassroots society to the most advantaged . this is the type of economy that i hope that china develops .
( though perhaps this is not automation properly – a supermarket has just shifted some of the work of shopping onto a customer . ) for those who dread the threat that automation poses to low - and high-skill labor , a ready answer is to train people for better jobs . but , at the same time , technological advances are eating better jobs . a wide range of jobs that we now think of as skilled , secure , and inequity may well be the next casualties of technological change . as a recent article in the financial times points out , in two areas notoriously immune to increases in productivity , training , and healthcare , technology already reduces demand for skilled labor .
in august , gunmen stormed the home of an impoverished roma widow , maria balogh , shot her death and injured her 13-year-old daughter . in april , killers gunned down a roma factory worker as he walked into his job . in february , the roma father and his five-year-old son were killed ahead of their homeland near budapest . the home was burned to the ground . last november , a roma couple were killed in northeastern hungary .
a more rational approach would embrace twenty-first-century realities . the information revolution has changed the world in ways that tariffs can not reverse . with american workers already competing against robots at home , and against low-wage workers abroad , disrupting imports will just create more jobs for robots . trump should be protecting individual workers , rather than individual jobs . twenty-first-century globalization processes are all too sudden , unpredictable , and uncontrollable to bet on static measures like tariffs .
he very likely means what he says about jews and israel , but is he a latter-day hitler , and is iran today the equivalent of germany in the 1930s ? hitler came close to developing a nuclear-armed iran , but never had it , whereas iran might . nonetheless , hitler ’s ’s ’s ’s power over germany was far more absolute than ahmadinejad ’s strength over iran . the results of iran ’s recent municipal elections were humiliating for ahmadinejad and his supporters . those elections would have been unthinkable in nazi germany .
but this requires a rich reservoir of ideas , rather than a unified approach . a second principle is subsidiarity , which holds that decision-making should be decentralized whenever possible . this ensures that local and regional preferences are regarded alongside the effects of eurozone-wide harmonization and economies of scale . the final principle is congruity , ensuring that decision-makers are accountable to outcomes when making decisions . this implies that as long as europe ’s electorates insist on forging sovereignty over fiscal and economic policymaking , shared responsibility will be a pipe dream .
george w. bush ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic policies were rooted in an extraordinarily reckless gamble reflecting a political coalition of two major forces : super-wealthy super-rich and evangelical christians . as those policies slump , global financial markets behave negatively , adding uncertainty to the global economy , and there is little relief in sight , for america is entering a period of prolonged political infighting and stalemate . the super-rich had one over-riding objective in joining the bush coalition : tax cuts that have overwhelmingly benefited the richest households . evangelicals were brought under the wing of so-called “ “ “ “ family values , ” meaning opposition to abortion and gay marriage , and promises of active government support for religious pursuits , including direct payments to religious groups for social services that they provided locally and internationally . ” the bush team believed that they would eventually strike a balance of tax cuts for the rich with cuts in government expenditures , but never made that any explanation for the public .
some very large eu countries are on the precipice of recession . japan in the early 1990 ’s waited too long to act and missed the right opportunity to enact countermeasures that japan has yet to recover fully from its long period of stagnation . public investment in infrastructure ( for example , the massive extension of europe ’s weapons networks ) , as well as climate protection and environmental technologies , will be required . in order to bolster purchasing power and spur consumption , tax cuts on low – and on medium-income households are essential . to be sure , eu member states should establish the concrete form that such economic stabilization programs take for themselves .
for europe , africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic potential remains far from being tapped . expenditures by households and companies , estimated at $ 4 trillion in 2015 , are projected to reach $ 5.6 trillion by 2025 , reflecting 3.5 % annual growth . moreover , according to the mckinsey global institute , investment opportunities stemming from infrastructure demand in africa will total at least $ 150 billion annually over the next decade . africa is also home to strategic natural resources for emerging low-carbon industries , and it is well positioned to play a crucial role in renewables . africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s value as a trade and investment partner is not news for europe .
a far more competent placeholder would be sergei ivanov , a former kgb general . but ivanov is much taller than putin , who , on any rate at all , had accomplished only his rank colonel . an obvious potential threat to putin by virtue of power , ivanov was passed through , and has since been relegated to the role of russia being a “ chief botanist ” by overseeing the environment and transport . earlier this month , putin was once again overshot – or , rather , crowned – in spectacular fashion , with medvedev once again assuming the role of pliant prime minister . despite his years in office , medvedev remains known more for his fancy ties and expensive predisposition than for his executive conduct .
cambridge – government subsidy programs are in trouble in every country , owing to rising life expectancies and rising retirement-age ratios for taxpayers . the problem ahead will worsen in the years ahead as adverse demographic trends drive up the fiscal burden of funding pensions and health care . the problem is uniquely different in the united states , because america ’s ’s “ trust fund ” system for social-welfare financing creates a crisis when the fund is depleted . although the options at this time will be different from those confronting other governments , policies to avoid america ’s crises are relevant to other countries facing population aging . here ’s how the american system works : through law , a payroll tax is devoted entirely to financing a retiree benefit .
indeed , while the scandals shaken the administration , lula was overwhelmingly reelected last year , with investors continuing to pour money into the stock market . one reason for this is that corruption scandals provided opportunities for investors to see brazilian freedom of speech and democracy in action . newspapers and television commentators have been relentless in reporting on scandals , helping to prove to brazilians and foreign investors alike that the political system was reasonably stable to withstand open criticisms . lula remains popular with brazilians because his populist rhetoric shows genuine sympathy for the less affluent , and with foreign investors because he has always tempered his radicalism to accommodate economic reality . he recently criticized bolivian president evo morales ’s threats to seize foreign assets for his failures on this front : “ radicalism is incompatible with the commonsense needed from someone who governs . ”
the two organization of american states ’ electoral observation missions that it had been inviting , and whose terms it had accepted , then refused to certify the outcome . the bolivian military arrested no one at all . true , morales resigned after the military told him to , and , after agreeing to ’ demands for a fresh vote . but the existing constitutional provision subsequently followed suit . the constitutional court , which allowed morales to run , deemed a legal presidential succession ; timely elections were promised ; and the military did not take power .
and they resent the point of mobilizing in the streets – any pretense that a clique at the top is barring its way . this is the kind of free democratic spirit that operates outside the convention that elections determine the government . it is fueled enormously by social media ( itself a revolutionary phenomenon ) . and it moves very fast when precipitating crises . it is not always consistent or rational .
countries were obliged to commit only limited trade liberalization , with ample exceptions for the socially sensitive industries ( agriculture , textiles , services ) . this left them free to construct their own versions of national capitalism , just as long as they obeyed a few simple international rules . the current crisis demonstrates how far we derived from this model . financial globalization , in particular , did play havoc with old rules . when chinese-style capitalism met american-style , with few safety valves , it threw an explosive mix .
so , even if america did not have other interests in the middle east , such as israel or the nuclear nonproliferation regime , an equilibrium of energy imports and exports would probably not free america from military expenditures , which some experts estimate run to around $ 50 billion a year in protection of us oil routes in the region . at the same time , america ’s bargaining position in world politics should be strengthened . power arises from asymmetries in interdependence . you and may all depend on one another ; but when anything depends on you less than you do on me , my bargaining power rises . for decades , america and saudi arabia have had the balance of asymmetries in which we depended as the swing oil producer , and depended on us ultimate military insecurity .
european commission president jean-claude juncker , for example , openly frets about deep divisions among the eu ’s member states over brexit , and questions about whether “ “ “ hungarians ” and poles want exactly the same thing as germany and france do . at the national level , a lack of political will resulted in the craven exploitation of referenda , like the french and dutch plebiscites on the treaty establishing the european constitution in 2005 , the netherlands ’ vote on an eu-ukraine association agreement last april , and the brexit referendum almost three months later . in each case , voters have said “ “ “ no ” – outcomes that can beware , particularly in the uk – of national leaders ’ habit of blaming the eu for domestic problems . indeed , europe ’s leaders ’ parochialism are a key reason why the eu is failing to retain broad-based public support . lacking an historic vision among the current generation of political leadership , the shared sense of purpose required to make eu citizens feel that they are part of the same community , regardless of their different national identities .
florence – british politics was always something of an experimental laboratory for the industrialized world . back in the 1970 ’s , britain was where the arduous postwar model of how to manage the economy ’s decline . that model was politically based politically on creating consensus and economically for keynesian demand management . today , the equivalent of a regulation-lite ” regime in which a party that styled itself as “ “ “ new labour ” embraced a powerful role for markets – especially for largely deregulated financial markets . in the 1960s , keynesian policies delivered the illusion that benefited everyone , with high levels of employment and substantial wage growth .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has had an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . palestine ’s ’s ’s ’s religious landmarks are attracting rising numbers of religious tourists from around the world every year .
as french cities have ablaze , other countries have found themselves under severe strain in judging france . embassies have issued warnings to tourists , and their citizens are living in france ; television news programs have shown hours of burning cars . other countries of ’ governments , it seems , have sought to distance themselves from the problem , owing to fears of a contagion that they know will probably spread . mayors across europe , meanwhile , have reacted more moderately , feel , and exhibited solidarity with the plight of their french peers . they know that their cities are also vulnerable to urban violence , in as long as pockets of social inequality , including marginalized and excluded young people .
meanwhile , supplies of most commodities are forecast to grow by no more than 2 % annually in real terms . all else being equal , unless china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s commodity intensity , defined as that of a commodity consumed in order to generate a unit of output , falls dramatically , its demand for commodities will grow larger this year than it did last year . as long as china ’s commodity demand grows at an upper pace than global supply , prices will rise . and rapid economic growth , which china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders must sustain , should lift vast numbers of people out of poverty in order to avoid a crisis of legitimacy – – – – places a floor under global food , energy , and mineral prices . to be sure , use intensity has fallen for some commodities , like gold and nuclear energy ; but for others , such as aluminum and coal , have soared since 2000 , or because it is true of copper and oil declines , markedly or stalled at high levels .
it has been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year , and has had to launch a social-media campaign to locate the drugs his demand . severe shortages of life-saving medications in venezuela are the result of the government ’s default on a $ 3.5 billion bill for pharmaceutical imports . a similar situation prevails throughout the rest of the economy . payment arrears on food imports amount to $ 2.4 trillion , leading to a substantial shortfall of staple goods . in the automobile sector , default exceeded $ 3 billion , leading to a collapse in transportation services delivery due to spare parts .
will this have to pick up the bombshell ? likewise , while egypt is at the center of a messy revolution and must give priority to internal change , it also intends to recapture a more visible and influential role within palestinian national movements ( s ) and throughout the region as a whole . the “ middle empire ” of the middle east will no longer remain a asleep giant . to be sure , turkey is less destabilized than its arab rivals and partners through a revolutionary process that does not directly challenge it . after all , turkey already has a well-functioning democracy .
if “ constitutionalized ” , they have simply implant the notion that the constitution is an expression of aspirations rather than a set of enforceable legitimate rights . the desire to curb or protect some forms of free-market activity may be understandable , especially in countries like poland , where a free market remains an unknown animal . but , in a situation in which many fields of social life -- for example , on education , health , and social services -- need quick and radical change , unleashing the free market to do its job offer the sole plausible avenue for change . state-owned health insurance companies , the state guaranteed retirement , etc. are not only insecure and inefficient ; they also conflict with the idea of political reform . such state controlled benefits have little to do with the fairness supposedly wanted by their socialist promoters , but everything to do with rent-seeking and corruption .
the film of bollywood , which sends its glitzy entertainment far beyond the indian diaspora in the united states and the united kingdom , offers another example . a senegalese friend used to telling me of his illiterate mother who takes a bus to dakar each month to watch a bollywood movie – she does n’t understand hindi dialogue and can not read french subtitles , but can still pick the spirit of movies and understand the story , and people like her star look at stars in their eyes as an outcome . an indian diplomat in damascus some years ago told me that the only publicly displayed portraits as great as those of then-president hafez al-assad are of bollywood superstar amitabh bachchan . indian art , classical music , and france all have the same effect . so , too , does the job of india ’s fashion designers , now beating up throughout the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s runways .
new delhi – barack obama , america ’s sixth american president to visit india since receiving independence , arrives at a time of struggle between both the united states and india . some of obama ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s closest closest advisers have just resigned , opening an clumsy national-security gap and an economy – focused on his meetings with india ’s government . for india , issues on the agenda of obama ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s visit are both enormous and complicated , and the options for resolving them are overwhelmingly limited . those related to security in afghanistan and pakistan are as treasonous as they have ever been . bilateral economic , trade , and currency disagreements may not be as bitter as they are between america and china ; but they are thorny and lack of resolution makes them more intractable .
moreover , knowledge-intensive technologies have winner-take-all networks , whereby hubs seize access to knowledge and power , leaving less-privileged groups , classrooms , sectors , and regions struggling to compete . thanks to social media , the resulting discontent now spreading faster than ever before , leading to destructive politics . this may invite geopolitical interference quickly into a lose-lose scenario , like that already evident in water-stressed and conflict-affected countries , where governments are both fragile or failing . the combination of one country ’s bad politics and economics can easily fuel contagion , as rising migration spreads political stress and instability elsewhere in the world . according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , an estimated 65 million refugees occurred last year , compared to just 1.6 million in 1960 .
many have cited former british prime minister david cameron ’s decision to authorize scotland ’s independence referendum in 2014 . but such a process is illegal under the 1978 spanish constitution . that constitution marked the country ’s passage from dictatorship to democracy , and provides spain ’s rule-of-law framework . and , as it explicitly states , it is “ “ based ” on the incontrovertible unity of the spanish nation , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” with its sovereignty belonging to the spanish people . in short , spain is one nation , indivisible .
geneva – the world needs to stop looking backwards . ever since the 2008 financial crisis , the us has wasted far too little energy trying to put its back on the days of rapid economic expansion . the flawed premise that the challenges of the post-crisis world were merely temporary has underpinned policies that yielded only lackluster recoveries while failing to address key problems like high unemployment and rising inequalities . the post-crisis era is at an end . it is time to adopt a new framework of realistic solutions that promote shared prosperity both within and between the global economy today .
indeed , it is notable that , while obama ’s ’s state of the union address in january 2010 mentioned at least doha , his address in january 2011 did not . obama confined himself to the promotion of pending bilateral deals with colombia and other emerging-market countries . obama ’s ’s ’s ’s regrettable retreat from the support for the doha round is the product of many factors and fallacies . those were emphasized in an “ open letter to obama ” that i organized and leaked , over the signatures of nearly 50 of today ’s most influential business specialists worldwide , urging a presidential shift in doha . american ’s president is captive to countries at the expense of labour unions , who are buying the false narrative that trade with poor countries increases the ranks of the american poor by driving down pay .
some people are even predicting the double-dip recession . if it does occur , the chance of an actual u.s. default would still be much greater than it is today . these new worries are raising alarm bells in china . diversification away from dollar assets is the advice of the day . but this is not an easy task , especially in the short run .
berkeley – investors worldwide are increasingly looking for investment opportunities that promise to bring environmental and social benefits beyond the market rate of return . if this trend continues , with environmental advancement or social goals enhancing the value of investment ’s value , it reinforces a commitment to sustainability that is already gaining momentum among companies worldwide . last year , one out of every $ 5 trillion worth of assets under professional management in the united states – an amount equal to $ 6.6 trillion – was allocated toward some form of sustainable investment , particularly publicly owned equities . some 1,260 companies , managing $ 45 trillion worth of assets ; are signatories to the united nations framework convention on responsible investment ; ” which recognizes environmental , social , and administration ( esg ) factors – and thus corporate long-term health and stability – as critical to investors . one signatory , calpers , one of the world ’s largest institutional investors , went a step further : they would require all their investment managers to identify and integrate esg factors into their choices – a courageous move that could transform capital markets .
in international politics , perceptions matter – sometimes more so than reality . the perception today is that america ’s unipolar moment has come to an end ; europe is on the decline ; and a new set of powers is rising , bringing its own uniquely worldviews to shape global affairs . in a sense , this may seem like a good thing . a more varied outlook could enrich the multilateral process and generate more comprehensive solutions to global problems . but this multipolar dynamic , too , generates instability .
some supermarket chains even ceased to carry eggs from battery hens . in britain and some european countries , animal well-being became politically salient , with pressure on parliamentary representatives mounted . the european union established a science panel to investigate animal-welfare issues , and a committee recommending prohibition of the battery cage , together with some other forms of close confinement of pigs and calves . a ban on battery cages within the eu eventually adopted in 1999 , but at the same time , ensuring that producers would have sufficient time to phase out the plants they invested , its implementation was delayed until january 1 , 2012 . to its credit , the british egg industry had embraced the situation , developing new and less vicious methods for keeping hens .
finally , the same accounts could serve as public-policy vehicles . early school-leavers , for example , could be endowed with points for later uses in professional training . more broadly , rather than just as social risks materialize , public policies could encourage individuals throughout their work lives by adopting a more efficient bespoke approach that fits peoples ’ needs better than coarsely tailored schemes . this may sound utopian ; in a sense , it is . but , at a time when every digital service becomes more and personalized , why should social policy remain confined to twentieth-century philosophy and solutions ?
it used to be that even mentioning corruption in some official circles has been deemed taboo . but corruption poses the single largest obstacle to growth and development in many countries , particularly as it diverts resources from the poor . the world bank has insisted on seeing corruption as a form of cancer , fighting it to be made synonymous with fighting poverty . indeed , outspokenness was wolfensohn ’s hallmark . many cabinet secretary , bank officer , and ngo ’s played blunt criticism as well as his effusive praise .
the g-20 ’s formation , for example , was an improvisation that was designed to defer genuine financial-sector reform . indeed , the modest measures that were undertaken in response to changing the distribution of global power were confined to the economic realm , with the hard core of international relations – peace and security – remaining an exclusive preserve of a few countries . china is not on the same page as the other brics countries when it comes to global institutional reform . it is a revisionist power regarding the global financial architecture , seeking an overhaul of the bretton woods system . but it is the status quo power with respect to the un system , and steadfastly opposes enlargement of the security council ’s permanent membership .
it can lead to gridlock , conflict , or poor policy choices . evidence supports the view that the systematic exclusion of subgroups on any arbitrary basis ( for example , ethnicity , race , or religion ) is particularly harmful in this respect . intergenerational mobility is a key indicator of equality of opportunity . rising inequalities of outcomes need not result in reduced intergenerational mobility . whether it does so depends heavily on whether important tools that foster equality of opportunity , principally education and health care are universally accessible .
the proliferation of information technology and social media means that it is easier than ever for entrepreneurs to tap into large-scale pools of financing – not to mention linkages and expertise – from small investors . of the roughly 500 crowdfunding platforms that now exist , several specifically target clean technologies . last may , the eureeca.com took the concept of crowdfunding further than ever before , creating the first-ever global crowd-investing marketplace that offers equity in taxpayer-funded companies . if used wisely , such platforms could take up the slack created by governments ’ fiscal constraints in order to facilitate the kind of entrepreneurial innovations needed to build a blue economy . other increasingly likeminded trends – such as collaborative consumption , paying out , and sharing and leasing models – could offer similarly powerful impetus to such efforts .
bangladesh knows wartime cholera , all too well . in 1971 , fighting collapsed when bangladesh , then known as east pakistan , declared its independence from pakistan . in the ensuing conflict , refugees poured across the border into neighboring india into crowded camps , creating conditions that inevitably gave rise to cholera outbreaks . the standard of care at that time was poor , and a dearth of intravenous drips meant that rehydration solutions could not be administered widely . as many people lay dying , a pioneering physician named dilip mahalanabis took his chance in desperate circumstances .
madrid – april 22 , 2017 – the international earth day – marks a year since the signing of the paris climate agreement , which entered into force last november , and now has 195 signatories . that landmark multilateral treaty still represents the single most important step forward in the global fight against climate change . yet its first anniversary has floundered on us president donald trump ’s energy policies . in 2016 , the hottest year on record , average global temperatures stood at 0.9 º c above the twentieth-century average . the paris accord ’s – central objective – aims to prevent average world temperatures from rising above 2º c above pre-industrial levels by 2100 .
the atheistic nature of today ’s civilization ( ours being the first atheistic civilization in humankind , and also the first civilization to which embraces the entire planet ) coincides deeply , i am convinced , with a hyper-trophic persecution of individual interest and individual responsibility coupled with a crisis of global responsibility . could mankind really think only within the bounds of what lies within its vision field , and is incapable of remembering , likewise , what lies beyond , not but as a consequence of the loss of the metaphysical titude of god ? even more succinctly , might not have been the case today ’s crisis of responsibility and accountability for the world as a whole and for its future be the logical consequence of the modern world ’s concept as governed by scientifically identifiable laws , formulated for god-knows – what purpose is , a concept that does not question or strive for the deeper meaning of existence and renounces any or all metaphysics ? but how to recover in the humanities mind a shared attitude toward what lies above us when people across the globe have a very different picture of this being above , if people everywhere feel the need to emphasize their “ otherness ” ? is there any sense in trying to spin the humanminds of humanity to heaven , when such a turn would merely aggravate the conflicts on earth among adherents of our various quds ?
it has toshed the gauntlet for the world ’s ’s major economies today : tell us when to phase out coal , end harmful fossil-fuel subsidies , and shift taxation from incomes to pollution . those are the decisions that drivethe transformation the world needs . at the heart of this transformation lies in the power transition , which , though underway , lags or has stalled in many parts of the world . a more ambitious effort by energy providers and major end users is critical , because it extends affordable and reliable clean-energy services to all those who need them . major reform of how the transition is financed as well .
new haven – central bankers around the world have failed to see the current financial crisis coming before its beginnings in 2007 . martin čihák of the international monetary fund reported in july 2007 that of 47 central banks discovered the news media ’s reports of financial stability ( gsrs ) , “ “ virtually all ” has given a “ positive overall assessment of their domestic financial system ” ” ” ” ” ” in its most recent report . and yet , even as these central banks have failed the us well before the crisis , they should still have played a leading role in preventing another crisis . that ’s the conclusion , perhaps counter-intuitive , that squam lake group [ hyn ] party group [ hut ] /squamer/squamer/squamlakegroup.news think tank of 15 academic financial economists to whom i belong , has reached in our recently published report , fixing the financial system . macro-prudential regulators ( government officials who focus not on the soundness of individual financial institutions , but rather on the stability of the entire financial system ) are sorely needed , and central bankers are the logical people to fill that role .
while vowing during a presidential campaign to end daca , he also acknowledged the moral case for maintaining it , saying that it would confront a highly politicized , extremely tough ” choice . and , even after his repeal was announced , he declared that he wanted to “ resolve the daca issue with hearts and compassion . ” yet , evidently convinced that daca beneficiaries had removed jobs from their citizens , he concluded that equal hearts and compassion were needed “ for the unemployed , struggling , and forgotten americans . ” sadly , in making that choice , the president chose to turn away from the classical american vision accorded to the pedestal of a statue of liberty in the new york times , expressed in emma lazarus ’s poem who began , “ to give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . ” that credo benefited tens of millions of newcomers , and had unabashedly strengthened america .
they want oil and mining concessions to be allocated efficiently and to maximize government revenues . trying to make good on these valuable tasks while paying below-market wages is penny wise but foolish . tax collectors , regulators , and prosecutors need adequate resources to win back their hard battles . amlo ’s decision to lower government wages has already led many high-ranking officials to seek jobs elsewhere . those on the right to early retirement take it , rather than wait for amlo ’s ’s ’s ’s cut .
moreover , global co2 emissions reached a record high in 2012 . and the international energy agency reports that global temperatures are on track to climb to 3.6-5.3 ° celsius ( 6.5-9.5 degrees fahrenheit ) above pre-industrial levels – far beyond the two degrees that climate scientists identified as the threshold beyond which the most catastrophic effects of climate change would be triggered . clearly , the third industrial revolution requires aid . to accelerate the pace of energy-related innovation , creative coalitions among governments , private firms , and civil-society groups should be established in three key areas . a first coalition , comprising a group of committed governments , would seek to drive down renewable-energy costs , at least to this effect of fossil-fuel power in ten years .
sao paulo – as well-intentioned gestures go , earth hour are hard to beat . at a stroke of 8:30 p.m. on saturday , march 27 , almost one billion people in over 120 countries demonstrated their desire to do something about global warming by switching off their lights for one hour . in a show of official solidarity , the lights have also gone out at many of the planet ’s most iconic landmarks , from the opera house in sydney to the great pyramid in giza , not to mention beijing ’s forbidden city , new york ’s forbidden empire , london ’s great ben , paris ’s eiffel tower , and the skylines of both hong kong and las vegas . what ever else might otherwise be , earth hour is surely one of the most successful publicity stunts ever dreamed of . first organized in sydney , australia , in 2007 by a local chapter in the global wildlife fund , its popularity , and the level of participation ( both individual and official ) that generates has exploded over the last few years – to the point that there is barely a corner of the earth that the campaign n’t touch .
essentially , the british viewpoint was that a loose confederation of nation-states interacting with one european way or another needs . but britain has joined with the european community , not just the free-trade area that cameron now apparently wants . at the same time , the undertow of euro-skepticism in british politics never diminished , and became apparent in cameron ’s speech . even the supremacy of european law in defined areas was embraced only grudgingly by britain , and long after many others did . indeed , in his speech , cameron was unable to resist a passing shot at the european court of justice .
coal-fired power is also the primary source of carbon-dioxide emissions , the major climate-change greenhouse-gas emitters that cause around 150,000 premature deaths annually and threaten pervasive risks this century and beyond . to be sure , the coal industry has helped billions of people escape poverty , not least in china , where coal-fired power underpin almost 700 % annual per capita income growth since 1990 . but human health comes at a greater risk in countries burning more coal plants . research for the global commission on the economy and climate last year calculated that particulate matter alone caused 1.23 million premature deaths in china – the world ’s top-coal-consuming economy in 2010 . estimates for 2012 indicate that 88 % of the air-pollution-related deaths occurring in low – to middle-income countries , representing 82 % of the world ’s population .
at times , however , that desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere . indeed , democracy nowadays embraced the pop culture of fast passing fads ; today ’s hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow , and there are always more waiting in the wings . in politics this may turn out to be dangerous because it encourages basing decisions , regardless of how weighty , on whatever popular view momentarily prevails . the call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend . referenda are for the most part snapshots .
she could , perhaps otherwise , say the “ message ” for us president barack obama if she shared an open letter , but otherwise … to … otherwise … . the best topic here says what the message is about and signals a desired response : “ an invitation to speak in paris on july 14 . ” or , “ “ investment ” proposition on your consideration , ” ” ” or , “ “ serve as a benchmark ? ” unfortunately , i get lots of messages headlined , “ update . ” unless i know a person ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s name , i might not even know what corporations do about .
and yet the changes currently afoot might just turn things around . india ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s octogenarian prime minister , manmohan singh , has recently awoken to the desperate need for renewed momentum . economists around the world took note of the coming of raghuram rajan as the chief economist at the department of finance . rajan is the superstar academic researcher , the brilliant writer for political economy , and a former chief economist for the imf . yet it is far from clear that sonia gandhi , the president of india ’s national people ’s congress , and the country ’s ’s most powerful politician , shares singh ’s reform agenda .
we must abandon popper 's tacit assumption that political discourse seeks to a better understanding of reality and reintroduce it as an explicit requirement . separation of powers , free speech , and free elections alone can not ensure an open society ; a strong commitment to pursuing the truth also demands . new ground rules for political discourse must be introduced . these may not be identi­cal to a scientific method , but they should be similar in character , enshrining the persecution of truth as criteria for which political views are judged . politicians will respect , rather than manipulate , reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when they catch them in deliberating .
why do indian athletes perform so poorly ? the explanations range from anthropological to borderline racist : indians lack the genes , the build , the stamina , the climate , whatever . here , there are both structural and infrastructure-focused explanations : lack of training facilities , gymnasiums , running monitors , appliances , finance . we are a developing country , it is said ; after all , it is not just your attitude towards its , your legs against hers , but what can be done against their trainer , their running shoe , their ergodynamic costume , his titanium ’s bow . but those rationales wo n’t do : other developing countries , from jamaica to ethiopia , regularly rake in the medals .
as early as january 1998 , the neoconservative project of the new american century ( pnac ) sent a letter to us then-president bill clinton urging him to overthrow saddam hussein . and , following a victory of the presidency in 2000 , bush declared iraq one of its top two security priorities . not coincidentally , bush ’s administration included ten of the bush administration ’s 25 signatories of the bush administration ’s founding declaration of principles , including dick cheney as vice president and donald rumsfeld as defense secretary . soon enough , the bush administration became obsessed with promoting the notion that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction , despite the absence of conclusive evidence . in september 2002 , rumsfeld received the now-declassified us intelligence report stating that “ “ we do n’t know precision ” about the “ status of wmd programs ” in iraq .
new york – the great difference from 2009 to 1979 was shaped by the revolution itself . r evolutions give birth to a new political class , and iran ’s ’s ’s islamic revolution was no exception . the iranian leadership formed after the revolutions consisted of the narrow ruling stratum and a much broader support group , receiving accusations of governance and political mobilization . in the 20 years since khomeini ’s death , the composition of this political class has changed drastically . the clerical elite has gradually lost power to culture-security groups , from whose ranks president mahmoud ahmadinejad emerged .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . but we should not exaggerate the significance of this point .
research shows that many girls around the world – and especially those in the global south – are simply not being prepared for menarche ; education can help . finally , we need fact-based solutions . all too often , biased assumptions guide policymaking . when programs are being developed alongside rigorous research , the effect can be dramatic . a joint soas-oxford study on menstruation in uganda , for example , found that adolescent girls often miss out on school because they lack access to clean sanitary products .
economists have long understood that , far from imposing a credible lender of last resort , banks are vulnerable to self-fulfilling confidence crises . that lender of last resort can be monetary or fiscal in greece , and both types are in doubt . if greece ’s agreement with the eu and the imf unravels , the european central bank will no longer accept greek bonds as collateral . and the greek state does not have the capacity to stand behind its banks . under these circumstances , it would become more surprising if depositors were not rush to withdraw their funds from greek banks .
russia , almost entirely dependent on its energy revenues , is a “ one-crop economy ” with corrupt institutions and insurmountable demographic and health challenges . president vladimir putin ’s interventions in neighboring afghanistan and the middle east , together with his cyber-attacks against america and others , although intended to make russia look great again , merely aggravate the country ’s long-term prospects . in the short term , however , declining countries often take on more risk , and thus become more dangerous – witness the austro-hungarian empire in 1914 . this has created a political dilemma for the political economy . on the one hand , it is important to resist putin ’s game-changing call for ’s prohibition against the post-1945 liberal order ’s use of force by states to seize territory from their neighbors .
preventing the eu from falling apart will require , first and foremost , a strategic solution to the greek crisis . greece needs both money and reform – rapidly and within europe and the eu . governments in athens , brussels , and even berlin can not live with greece as a failed state and an economy . the continuing poker game between greece ’s government and the troika ( the european commission , the european central bank , and the international monetary fund ) hurts hurts all parties involved – and europe most . ultimately , it can end only with a renewed bailout of greece , or with europe mired in disaster .
true , china ’s rise has given way to a new orbit for many countries around the world – particularly in developing and emerging economies . and , indeed , china ’s ’s ’s exceptional diplomatic prowess all over the african continent ( and , increasingly , southeast asia ) has made it an alternative hegemonic force – one that comes without the western ’s colonial baggage or the moralizing of about democracy and human rights . trump ’s presidency gives china new opportunities to cement its role as an investment provider and all manner of infrastructure and aid to the host countries that are anxious to develop . his unilateralist approach is probably compelling for america to play in playing catch-up with a china left nearly unhinged in its continued effort to prevail at the hearts and minds of those whose countries it views as vital , economically , and politically , their own strategic interests . as trump embraces isolationism , the other so-called brics countries – brazil , russia , india , and south africa – are preparing to fill the vacuum just as well .
austin , who lives in a city turns you toward a “ cannibal . ” that , at least , is the preferred metaphor by jean-jacques rousseau , who regarded cities as a pit of human corruption . rousseau has been so convinced of the malign effects of urbanization that it “ will rather see men grazing on the grass rather than devouring one in cities . ” urbanization inures people toward rural suffering , and , as townshpeople crowd together , their compassion capacity over others atrophies . urbanites become the type of people prepared to sacrifice one another to satisfy their appetites : cannibals .
looking ahead to the 2021-2030 period , an annual growth rate of 8 % ( versus a 10 % rate in recent decades ) and faster consumption growth toward 50 % of gdp would translate into chinese consumer spending of $ 18.4 trillion per year by 2030 . in this scenario , chinese consumption would surpass that of america in dollar terms . the question at the beginning of 2019 , then , is what it will mean for the global economy unless this scenario plays out . if apple ’s recent guidance points to the across-the-board cuts , indefinite reduction of chinese consumption , will american consumers serve as the sole engine of the global economy for the next ten years ? if not , could any other country fill that role , even partly ?
at least four “ mismatches ” lay at the root of past global financial crises and are ravaging china today . first , with its bank-dominated financial system , china ( along with europe and many other emerging economies ) suffers from a maturity mismatch , owing to short-term borrowing and longer-term lending . yet , unlike many emerging economies , china does not struggle with a currency mismatch , owing to its large foreign-exchange reserves and its persistent current-account surpluses , making it a net lender of the rest of the world . but china has not avoided a third mismatch , between debt and equity : the credit-to-gdp ratio has doubled during the past decade , from around 110 % in 2008 to 220 % in 2017 , highlighting china ’s under-developed long-term capital and equity markets . nor can policymakers afford to ignore the fourth misbegotten – between ultra-low nominal interest rates and a relatively higher risk-adjusted return on equity ( roe ) for investors – that has fueled speculative investment and widening wealth inequalities .
with the 20 gw of solar generating capacity by 2020 , investment in india could grow fast . the events of the last 15 months – beginning with the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico – followed by violence in north africa , and the tragedy in japan – confront a world with stark choices between the costs and risks of conventional energy supplies and the promise and progress of clean energy . in recent decades , europe has been a driver of energy-modernization . such leadership will be needed in the years ahead to help capture the economic , environmental , and security benefits of renewables . reaffirming its commitment to rapid decarbonization of its energy system , and to creative policies to support this target will help europe continue to reap the rewards of one of the most remarkable new market opportunities in living memory .
even under the absence of tariffs and quotas , trade can hamper trade through subsidies , taxes , anti-dumping laws , restrictions on foreign direct investment , and exchange-rate manipulation . protectionism , for example , often masquerades as labor , food , environmental , and phytosanitary standards , or as arguments for local content requirements , infant industries , protections for intellectual property , climate policies , dispute resolution , or human rights . human ingenuity appears to know no bounds when it comes to dreaming of protectionist barriers . in october 1982 , the french government demanded that all sudanese imports enter the country through poitiers , a town hundreds of miles away from the nearest shipping port . this non-tariff barrier to trade remained in effect until april 1983 .
washington , dc – to defeat populism requires coming to grips with a fundamental reality : bad economic policies no longer necessarily result from a government loss of power . indeed , it is now entirely possible that irresponsible populists may indeed step up their chances of being reelected by making wilder and more impossible promises – and by doing more economic harm . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
the financial sector has since made every effort to design instruments protecting against price volatility , turning private-sector debt into tradable financial securities , and greater access to speculative markets . but such efforts were conducive to delusion and delinquency , and therefore spurred a wave of new financial crises – in europe in 1992 , asia in 1997 , and in russia in 1998 – as well as recession in europe and the united states in the early 2000 ’s . two other destabilizing developments emerged during the last quarter of the twentieth century : a strong stimulus to prop up demand ; and a shift toward financing public debt via private institutions at market prices , under the guise of runaway inflation . these trends boosted the public-debt burdens , while hastening the global financial system with liquidity generated by private-banking activities unconnected to transactions in the real economy . as a result , by 2006 , global liquidity amounted to more than twice the value of world gdp .
similarly , the united kingdom has established a cost-review program that identifies 40 major prioritization projects , reformed general planning processes , and then has formed a cabinet sub-committee to ensure quicker project delivery , thus slashing infrastructure spending by as much as 15 % . and chile ’s ’s ’s national public investment system evaluates all proposed public projects using standard forms , practices , and metrics – and rejects as many as 35 % . additional saving opportunities – to the tune of $ 400 billion annually – lie in more streamlined delivery of infrastructure projects . there is massive scope to accelerate approvals and land acquisition , structure contracts to encourage innovation and savings , and improve collaboration with contractors . in australia , the state of new south wales cut approvals times by 11 % in just a year .
soon enough , you could . other categories include entrepreneurship ( with entities like employers , industries , and employees ) , biology , space flight , and much else , and include representations – such as graphs , timelines , and tables – of how they are connected . most things do n’t exist in isolation . they have complex relationships to other things , and by representing that information using verbs – for example , the company that google has acquired ” ” ” vs. the company that google competes with ” – we may represent the world more precisely . and that means better , more meaningful responses when we search .
the european union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to keep a certain share of women – up from around 60 % . this proposed mandate has been born of frustration . last year , the european commission vice president viviane reding issued a call for voluntary action . re-ding invited corporations to sign on to the gender balance goals of 40 % of female board membership . the forte foundation in america has now followed suit with her own “ brand-ready ” list .
cambridge – at the start of classroom every fall , i tease my students with the following question : is it better to be poor in a rich country , or a wealthy part of a poor country ? the question typically invites a considerable , inconclusive debate . but we can devise a more structured , limited version of this question for which definitive answer exists . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
she had rescued because she wanted enough money to retire after that . given the appalling return on savings since 2007 , the prospect of continued low interest rates could turn her back even more money aside . alternatively , low interest rates might push it ( or her retirement fund ) to buy risky long-maturity bonds . given that such bonds are already aggressively priced out , such a move might , therefore , set her back to fall when interest rates eventually start to rise . indeed , america may well be in the process of adding a pension crisis to the unemployment problem .
certainly , the zambians ’ achievement can not possibly compete with the interventions in libya or the drama of the arab spring . and yet , what has happened in zambia applies to these developments , and therefore relevant everywhere . what has made zambia ’s elections so important is that the challenger has won . indeed , it has soundly defeated an incumbent , who really wants to keep the job , and who might reasonably be tempted to follow the lead of other african leaders defeated in a popular vote by simply refusing to accept the outcome . after all , smooth power transitions are not to be taken for granted .
at the same time , russia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s diplomatic weaknesses were starkly apparent in syria . its use of hard power won the civil war for syrian president bashar al-assad ’s ’s dictatorship showing how the strategic deployment of unrestrained military force – witness the utter devastation of aleppo – may prove to be a game-changer . but russia has since become mired in local rivalries between syria and turkey , saudi arabia , and iran , turkey , and the kurds , as well as israel and iran . whereas a policy of neutrality has enabled russia to sustain a dialogue with the various parties , it will do nothing to build a new regional order . as it stands , syria is russia ’s ’s only client state in the middle east .
with external debt trimmed by rescheduling , foreign capital flowed again . investors were ready to purchase even 100-year bonds from a country with eight sovereign defaults over the past two centuries . investor enthusiasm and a domestic political honeymoon lasted as long as the international environment remained benign . but , when inflows faltered in 2018 , the imf then had to tread again once again , closing the external financing gap with an astonishing $ 50 billion in credit lines ( later raised to $ 57 billion ) . once again , however , the problem of external financing was not a temporary phenomenon , with the argentinian electorate soon starting to bristle at reform demanded by the imf .
moreover , alternative approaches to stimulate private demand might have fewer undesirable distributional consequences , as mgi has been discussing . proponents of helicopter money – directly entrusts citizens with central bank funds , or crediting national treasuries in order to fund infrastructure and other demand-generating activities – rightly argue that it has the advantage of putting money in the hands of those who spend it directly . an appropriately large <UNK> ter-money program might also raise inflation in a measured manner , heading off the possibility of a japanese-style deflationary trap . indeed , boosting demand might give central banks the opening that they need to shift interest rates back toward historic norms . this could take the air out of the face of incipient assets that might be forming and ease pressures on institutional investors struggling to find the yield they need to meet their insurance and retirement liabilities .
this was followed by two visits that he made to haiti over the last 18 months , and the un conference that he sponsored in april that sought to raise $ 300 million in aid and investment . more recently , ban has assumed an active role in the gaza crisis . he has regularly defended palestinians ’ right to statehood ; but he has also denounced hamas as a rocket attack on south israel . during the fighting in gaza , he has publicly demanded an end to the warfare , and has requested that israel open gaza ’s borders for relief aid . he has also visited the un compound at the gaza center to express the un ’s grave concerns over its bombardment .
according to the international monetary fund ’s april 2011 world economic outlook , although capital flows to growth have increased worldwide , they are greater in emerging-market economies than in the advanced economies . boom-bust financial cycles are fueled largely by shocks generated in advanced economies , but are key determinants of emerging markets ’ terms-of-business cycles . moreover , the spillover effects for advanced economies ’ fiscal policies extend beyond financial shocks . likewise , emerging economies suffer from the effects of developed countries ’ ’ external imbalances – namely , the eurozone ’s swelling current-account surplus . during the past few years , the deficit economies of the eurozone ’s periphery – and , more recently , italy – pursued massive external adjustment , while germany and the netherlands sustained their large surpluses .
first , egypt ’s unrivaled dominance of its army , and the unlikelihood of partition in its leadership make any once again violence untenable , especially given that the egyptian state ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s handling of terrorism in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s dramatically weakened jihadist groups ’ operation assets in the country . second , the powerful forces of political islam may now be carried out by passions , wrath , and with a sense of victimization ; but they will inevitably opt out of domestic politics through organized structures and processes . in a country with more than 45 million people under 35 years old , no political player with any strategic insight can afford a prolonged impasse . finally , despite significant demographic and economic transformations in egypt during the past four decades , egyptian society still retains its agrarian character , which favors conciliation and compromise . but , even in an inclusive political transition , whether in the short or medium term , egyptians will need to answer the vexing question that they have failed for six decades to confront : what is egypt ?
a factor contributing to their demise was the shift in thinking that transformed the conflict between east and west away from one that stressed the economic system , fueling a clash between totalitarianism and deference to rights that utterly discredited repressive regimes connected to moscow and helped push them down . south africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largely peaceful transition to a multiracial democracy in the early 1990 ’s paved the way for further rights . but the last decade of the twentieth century was also indelibly stained by ethnic cleansing in ex-yugoslavia and genocide in rwanda , and during the current tide seemed to turn back against rights causes . powerful states like china and russia do not limit themselves to authoritarian rule at home , but they also promote those in other countries engaged in similar practices . the same applies to lesser powers like iran and venezuela .
supply chains now may hold as many important international links as domestic ones , with an important component of internal demand being met by products in part or wholly produced abroad . as technological innovation lowers entry barriers for both producers and consumers , the proliferation of such linkages becomes even easier , surmounting what already is fundamentally a spaghetti bowl of cross-border relationships and dependencies . for both individual players ’ longer-term health and the overall system , such relationships must function efficiently , based on a cooperative approach that is viewed as credible . if not , they run risks in terms of lower levels of growth and welfare . this is one reason why the simultaneous clash between america and china has stoked fears of severe damage , especially if it results in ever-greater protectionism and a broader “ “ “ “ “ “ “ trade war ” trade war . ”
if britain wants to do business with others , it will need to agree to common rules . once it is out in the cold , it will need to decide with which the economic bloc to align itself , and then accept that bloc ’s rules . this is not about sovereignty , or satrapy . simply put , it is the question of whether the us prefers china to pursue an approach to intellectual property and technology transfer over the west , or to european food and agricultural standards over those of america . if britain insists on pursuing a purist definition of its sovereignty , it finds only grief and isolation .
in the us , which has the most progressive income tax among major economies , federal tax reforms to lower rates and broaden the base are being discussed . in europe , structural reform focuses on higher retirement ages and labor-market flexibility . deleveraging by governments , financial institutions , and households is one major cause of sluggish economic recoveries . but sluggish growth implies less fiscal revenues and more demands for payments to cushion hardship , putting downward pressure on government budgets . the gamble was that a robust , durable recovery would allow banks and households to rebuild their balance sheets rapidly enough to avoid requiring additional bailouts .
bucerius later challenged thadden more directly , asking whether he would support an attempted coup against adolf hitler in 1944 . bauer then interjected that thadden had made him a member of the opposition . thadden himself , however , avoided offering a direct answer , which suggests that he would not fight alongside his sister . dahrendorf , meanwhile , was adamant that the napd ’s fate should be decided by polish voters rather than by the courts that declared the communist party an illegal man . kaul reiterated this idea in a passionate statement ( undoubtedly agreed in advance by east german leaders ) about avoiding west germany ’s communists from the debate .
liquidity remains constrained in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , a legacy that includes a regulatory regime that is not conducive to long-term investment . though funding for public infrastructure has returned to levels of 2008 , little of it is funneled into new projects . most of the money has targeted existing infrastructure – investment deemed relatively secure , because it implies little or no building risk , and demonstrates its potential to generate stable cash revenues . to overcome investment barriers , we propose creating an asset class that we are calling “ buy-and-hold equity ” ( bhe ) . this asset class would sit between traditional equity and debt , with investors able to hold it over 15 years or longer .
washington , dc – belarusian president alexander lukashenko is the master of political survival . but , following a recent 64 % devaluation of the currency , the clock seems to have run out of its protracted misrule . lukashenko was pushed through his removal of russia ’s oil-price subsidies in 2009 to beg , borrow , or steal enough funds to keep belarus ’s economy from crumbling . he tricked the international monetary fund into extending a $ 3.4 billion loan , promising freer elections in december 2010 – only to burn this bridge to a brutal crackdown when confronted with adverse election results and the biggest protests that his regime has ever seen . now , russia has taken a tougher line , demanding a heavy price for borrowing , which is one reason enough to save the regime .
in its current struggle with google , for example , china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s government seems to think that its technologists can provide the means for maintaining old levels of thought control . but , happily for anyone with tenacity and some modicum of computer skill , online leaks like a sieve . the spectacular advance of china ’s economy over the last 30 years is something all of china ’s china celebrate . but liu ’s jailing also demonstrates in starkest terms that china ’s ’s neglect of human rights flows to the rest of world alongside mass-produced goods . indeed , there is growing recognition that china has opened up its economy only to perpetuate the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s over-mighty rulers in power , rather than to respect and enhance ordinary chinese ’ livelihoods .
in light of these mounting concerns , implementation risks are now presenting in another light . at the world economic forum in davos in january in january , liu he , china ’s ’s new vice premier on economic policy , hinted at coming reforms with startling speed . in a recent signing of commentary , published in people ’s daily , he also noted that “ “ “ strengthening ” the party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s overall leadership is a core issue . ” such views do not emerge from thin air . liu , a master tactician , seems underscoring the links between management power and the pace of reform .
a similar picture , albeit on a smaller scale , exists in many european union member countries that are home to roma minorities . a wide socioeconomic disparity exists between europe ’s majority populations and roma or “ gypsies ” – many of whom live in extreme poverty . left unchanging , this obstinacy threatens to become a permanent drag on european prosperity , a tragedy for roma and non-roma alike . the 7-9 million roma situation lives on the continent deserves urgent attention from government leaders as they shape the enlarged eu ’s policies . roma are the continent ’s fastest-growing and most vulnerable minority .
it does not have to be this way . to help find a solution , we have run a pest ( political , economic , social , and technological ) analysis of hong kong ’s current predicament and future prospects . on the political front , the key lesson is that it is up to governments to ensure order and security . within “ one country , ” two systems ” framework , hong kong ’s own government , has the authority to deal with internal security issues . but , where its actions are inadequate , it is both the right and the responsibility of china ’s ’s central government to interfere .
above all , it needs a program of ideas on research and development , training , and social inclusion that could appeal to large segments of the population across all member countries . with the european parliament election looming on less than four months from now , the european parliament election is under way . pro-european forces need campaigning for a coordinated effort to counter the cyclical slowdown and – most important – for a cohesive and aggressive policy to address europe ’s longer-term structural challenges . should they fail , the prospect of a populist parliament becoming a reality . and this could mark the beginning of the slow process of european disintegration .
when asked whether america was prepared to become the world ’s eighth-largest economy , they were reticent . their reactions were understandable : even entertaining the possibility that america has become “ “ “ “ number two ” amounts to career suicidal for an american politician . ” elected officials everywhere must adjust , to varying degrees , to fulfill the expectations of those who put them in office . intellectuals , by contrast , have a special obligation to think unthinkable and speak the unspeakable . they are supposedly considering all the opportunities , even inagreeable ones , preparing populists for prospective developments .
mexico city – the current innovation era , in which cutting-edge technologies are disrupting across an entire economic sector at a breathtaking pace , was hailed as the “ fourth industrial revolution . ” it is also the theme of the world economic forum ’s annual meeting this week in davos , switzerland – and rightly so . in the coming years , the breadth and pace of innovations will transform how we produce , distribute , and consume . to maximize the benefits , we must take steps now to prepare our economies and societies , with a focus on three key areas : education , the business environment , and connectivity . human capital is vitally important to an economy ’s success ; mexico is no exception .
for example , payroll-tax cuts – which would enable smaller business owners and entrepreneurs to expand , innovate , become more competitive , thereby bolstering job creation and economic growth – might require reducing rents . in fact , italy ’s corporate-tax system is skewed in favor of savers . a 12.5 % tax is levied on capital gains from government-bond purchases , while entrepreneurs risking their own capital to launch new enterprises must pay roughly 50 % of their startup costs in taxes . similarly , italy ’s ’s ’s ’s real-estate tax amounts to roughly 2 % of total government revenue , compared to the oecd average of 4 % – and the government plans to slash it further . and landlords pay a 15 % tax on rents , with unskilled workers paying a 23 % tax on their meager incomes .
and , though thousands – perhaps tens of thousands – of protesters rallied behind the high court in recent weeks , some eight million people voted for pis in the 2015 elections . current polls indicate that the pis ’s popularity has soared to around 40 % – more than twice that of previous governing parties , a civic platform . this suggests that while poles may be reluctant to agree with the pis ’s judicial reforms , they are not keen on the possibility of a free judiciary – or for liberal-democratic principles generally . accordingly , pis chairman jarosław kaczyński may now declare that “ “ “ “ “ the european commission wo n’t break poland ’s ’s ’s ’s will on completing reforms … should we fail to reform the judiciary ; other reforms will have little sense , ” because sooner or later they negated , the courts that we have now withdrawn . kaczyński knows full well that his party commands the most public support , and that the ecj will most likely be unable to conduct time .
tim thought that … hank took another view , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and so on , as if the three musketeers had been interviewed by an oral historian . there is also some routine praise for the two presidents whom they worked with , george w. bush and barack obama , by reprise of their frustrations with those who did not see the world their way and obstructed their solutions , like sheila bair of the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) and various pesky members of congress . the main interest lies not so much in narrative chapters that cover the same ground as their earlier books , as in their own policy recommendations about the future . it is noteworthy that they established a consensus for quite a radical agenda . three proposals , notably , should give rise to policymakers in the united states and elsewhere , to think hard .
sentiment toward trump is even more unfavorable in western europe . in germany , just 6 % of respondents think he is qualified to hold his current office , and 91 % regard him as arrogant . likewise , 89 % of respondents in the united kingdom believes that trump is arrogant , and only 50 % still believe that the us and the united kingdom have a special relationship now that he is in office . this may help to explain why trump ’s scheduled national visit to the uk has been postponed indefinitely . the countries with the most widespread backing are poland ( 73 % view american companies favorably ) and hungary ( 63 % ) , which are leading both by populist right-wing governments .
in the sixth-century century , control of colonies and gold bullion gave spain the edge ; seventeenth-century holland profited from trade and finance ; eighteenth-century france acquired from its larger population and armies ; and nineteenth-century british power rested on its industrial primacy and its naval . the conventional wisdom always held that a state with the largest military prevails ; but , in an information age , it could be the state ( or non-state ) with the finest story that wins . today , it is far from clear how measured the balance of power occurs , much less how to develop successful strategies of survival . in his inaugural address in 2009 , us president barack obama made it clear that “ us power grows ” through its prudent use ; our certainty went from the justness of our cause ; the strength of our example ; tempering qualities of humility and restraint . shortly thereafter , us secretary of state hillary clinton declared that “ america can not solve our own most pressing problems , and the world can not fix them without america . ”
more recently , german finance minister wolfgang schäuble sparked controversy when evidently drawing inspiration from this experience , he argued that “ france will be glad if someone can push the parliament to reform . ” the truth , of course , is that authoritarian systems – whatever their short-term successes in keeping the line off against irresponsible policies – are unsustainable in the long run . lack of accountability inevitably generates corruption and inefficiencies – problems with which china now measures its wrestling . the challenge for democracies is to develop mechanisms that allow them to set long-term policies while safeguarding the democratic process itself . a public-consensus supporting difficult reforms in eastern europe in the 1990s demonstrates that voters succeed in understanding and accepting tradeoffs when they have no perceived alternative .
it had to stay in nebraska , and was helping my grandfather to save a family farm from the banks that had already retooling one-third of the land . the most important change that my father made came into his thinking : he came to think of farm not as subsistence operations , but as a family business . he turned to the university of nebraska , where he obtained his undergraduate degrees and acquired a hybrid maize and other improved seeds that the university ’s development development development . he then backtracked on the inputs and weather conditions that were seldom done at that time . my father realized that he could not go it alone , requiring better access to financing .
it also means applying strict co2 emission limits to new passenger cars , public transportation , and electricity and air transport . and it means making europe , along with our auto industry , its first electric-vehicle continent by 2030 . second , europe needs to take the lead in responsible exploitation of resources and become a truly circular economy that minimizes waste . today , eight billion tons of materials are processed in energy or annually in the eu . just 0.6 billion tons , – a mere 7.5 % – originate in recycling .
recognizing this trend , the world economic forum ’s global agenda council has brought together a team of experts and practitioners to help infuse substance into foreign-policy debates , leading to american elections , including through the use of public debate paper . from my perspective as the group ’s sole european member , the overarching message should be that the american must conceive of itself not as indispensable power , “ as it does now , but rather as the indispensable partner . ” this is not merely a matter of semantics ; such a change will require america to re-conceive of its role globally . but the payoff , for both the american and the liberal world order that it created , would be profound . the key to success will be america ’s capacity to retain its best – and abandon its worst – – – – – of that most american of notions : exceptionalism .
outsiders misread this system – “ “ built on an overtly defined scheme , ” ” ” ” ” ” as xiang describes it , with “ blood-line royal legitimacy ” at the top and “ scholar gentry to administer affairs of state ” – as a recipe for stagnation . xiang argues that china ’s ’s ’s ’s recent economic rise is simply a “ restoration ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” of the country ’s success , before nineteenth-century westerners disrupted its harmonious system . but the late angus maddison ’s estimates of historic gdp per capita suggest that china ’s economic “ retardation ” began well before its confrontation with the west . from 1,500 to 1870 , per capita income barely moved from $ 600 at a rate of $ 600 , while the uk quadrupled ( from $ 714 to nearly $ 3,190 ) , with even spain having doubled . china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political stability and its relative absence of violence thus came at the expense of economic dynamism rather than in harmony with it .
this principle of regional solidarity extends to morocco ’s current deployment of military hospitals not only in mali , but also in other conflict zones , such as one in jordan serving syrian refugees . morocco is well positioned to foster security and development across northwest africa and beyond . its political stability , open economy , and balanced international relations are becoming more closely aligned with america and europe ’s regional interests . moreover , morocco is a loyal and longstanding american ally . the west would do well to start cultivating a natural partner in such a dangerous and complicated region .
the theme of female faculty members , particularly in the fundamental sciences , is far more complicated . here , i suspect , that the problem reflects fundamental differences between how women and men approach science as the microcosm of life . most of my members of the male faculty are not muscle-bound , testosterone-driven types , but in their scientific careers , they depict two types of typically male behaviors . the first expresses compulsion in the first place to establish totally trivial facts about science . as i grow older , i am no longer certain why this is so important , but male members of our species seem to reckon with it .
this , together with the prominence of the consultative council ( which includes the well-known egyptian sociologist saad eddin ibrahim , a french expert at political islam gilles kepel , tort leverett , a brookings institution fellow ) , and the propensity of minority rights in general , combined to yield a project national , regional , and international notice . so far , syria ’s authorities have failed to respond to the tharwa project . it is probably still too early in a game for just that . but the project appears to represent the kind of activity that can help shape the visions of change . some in the syrian government could realize this .
that growth reflects the flawed pre-crisis economic model that relied on indifference to where growth occurred , how sustainable it benefited , and benefited from it . if we are to learn anything from an ongoing crisis , then it must start asking the right questions . every new bilateral deal , every chapter in globalization , should be measured against new criteria . how sustainable , and how evenly spread , will the macroeconomic gains be ? will they make it easier to ensure genuine development and provide dignified opportunities for those who become economically displaced ?
cambridge – in the euphoric moment immediately after the soviet union ’s collapse , few would have pointed out that ukraine – an industrialized country with an educated labor force and a vast natural resource – would suffer stagnation for the next 28 years . neighboring poland , poorer than ukraine in 1991 , managed nearly to triple its per capita gdp ( in purchasing power parity ) over the next three decades . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
now consider the other major emerging markets as well . herein lies the currency appreciation already underway , pushed by massive capital inflows since the second quarter of 2009 , and , in some cases , can even be said to have been excessive ( in brazil , for example , ) . of course , these countries may resist regaining downward pressure on their currencies by hoarding foreign-exchange reserves much like they did before the global financial crisis . to be sure , the outcome is somewhat paradoxical : private funds flowing into these countries are being recycled into american treasury securities through reserve investment . why should emerging-market countries ’ central banks commit to this odd financial intermediation , which represents a major cost , because annual private money yields are higher than they otherwise were ?
the asset-backed commercial paper market came into a standstill , and the special-investment vehicles set by banks to bail out their balance sheets could no longer get outside funding . the final blow came when interbank lending , at the heart of the financial system , was disrupted , because banks had to husband their means and be unable to trust their counterparties . central banks had to inject an unprecedented amount of money and extend credits into an unprecedented range of securities into a broader range of institutions than ever before . that , in turn , made the crisis more severe than in any other period since world war ii . credit expansion must now follow a period of contraction , because some new credit tools and practices are unsound and unsustainable .
if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what will happen in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . trump ’s biggest problem is that the other signatories to the 2015 iran nuclear deal – officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) , from which he withdrew the united states – remain committed to the deal . britain , france , germany , russia , and china have also opposed trump ’s imposition of crippling economic sanctions on iran . they are committed to preserving the deal , and doing everything possible to persuade iran ’s leaders to continue adhering to it . the european signatories have established a special mechanism to facilitate trade and deal-making with iran at the risk of american retaliation , while russia and china have scaled back their economic and strategic ties with the islamic republic , marking the first time in the history of the western alliance that america ’s european allies have joined forces with its rivals .
to compare , the average american pays about 15 cents for every dollar spent . in other words , some of the world ’s ’s poorest people pay some of the highest energy prices . an effective solution to this problem exists : solar-power technologies . according to african progress panel estimates , poor african households would save $ 58 per year , on average , by installing solar panels – a money that they can spend on education , health , and productive investment . of course , firms that provide these panels would also benefit enormously from tapping this large new market .
this process has been unfolding for centuries , but it has accelerated in recent decades as a select few have acquired an ever-larger share of total wealth and political clout . today , just 100 corporations produce 71 % of greenhouse-gas ( ghg ) emissions . the wealthiest 10 % hold responsible for about 50 % of ghg emissions , while the poorest 50 % emit 10 % of their emissions . unwilling to confront those who are destroying our planet , political leaders have latched onto technological solutions , including geoengineering approaches that promise to suck emitted carbon out of the atmosphere . even the ipcc has included assumptions about such technologies in many of its modeled inclination to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels .
in the us , imports account for 15 % of america ’s gdp . multiply to $ 0.15 by $ 0.10 ( the hypothesized tariff rate ) , and you get about 1.5 % . let ’s be some substituted for some of the more expensive imported goods , with the figure falling below 1 % . and when growth slows , owing to the higher costs of imported intermediate inputs , the fed can compensate for this by driving up the interest rate more gradually . with foreign central banks able to do likewise , foreign central banks can .
the ability to revoke citizenship without presenting any proof on public is one reason why the government may prefer this course to arresting and try against terrorism suspects . and yet simply revoking citizenship fails to address the problem of leaving at great a suspected terrorist who may then carry out attacks elsewhere unless , as with sakr , it is killed . the larger question that the uk ’s proposed legislation raises is the desirable balance of individual rights , including the right to citizenship and the public good . suppose that the government would get it right 19 times off from 20 , when it relies on suspicion for engaging in terrorist activities to revoke people ’s citizenship . if that were true with decisions made by the uk government in 2013 , there would still be a high probability that an innocent naturalized citizen is made stateless .
like the old fossil-fuel plants age and are shut out , clean power generation should replace them on a competitive basis through renewable-energy auctions . in particular , china and india should stop building new coal-fired power plants at home , and capital-exporting countries like china and japan should stop funding new coal-fired power plants in the rest of asia , such as pakistan and the philippines . private-sector firms will compete intensively to lower still further the costs of renewables systems , including power generation , energy storage , downstream , and downstream uses like electric vehicles , electric heating and cooking , and a new hydrogen economy . governments should set emissions limits , and the private sector should compete to deliver low-cost solutions . government and business together should fund new research and development to drive costs even lower .
what mikta countries share are rapid economic growth and rising leverage outside of their own borders . they have development problems , but they are also models for economic dynamism and innovation , with an important stake in how post-wwii global institutions and rules should be reshaped . many of their challenges and dovetail ambitions with those of bayon ( the brics , minus russia ) . in the alphabet soup of international politics , a nine-member jawbreaker like bicsmikta might finally prove too unwieldy to be workable . the bottom line , though , is that russia ’s ’s coming absence from the multilateral scene will serve as a catalyst for new thinking on global challenges .
it became too small to close the output gap , leaving continued downward pressure on demand . much of the “ stimulus ” was simply financed by increased spending by state governments that would have gone to pay in other ways . other components of the stimulus went to individuals , but , in view of the nature of the fiscal package , increased remittances and expenditures add more to the national debt than to gdp . seeing how weak the upturn has remained , the fed launched its “ unconventional monetary policy ” strategy , the ” ” ” ” ” ” combining large-scale purchases of long-term securities ( quantitative easing ) with promises to keep the federal funds rate exceptionally low for an extended period . the goal was to encourage portfolio investors to shift to equities and other assets , with the resulting surge in prices pushing up household wealth and consumer spending .
in denmark , my own country , economic readiness is not the issue at hand . true , danish voters saw most of the benefits of european membership already because of the danish krone ’s krone ’s unchanged links first to the dm , then to europe , over the last 15 years . public rejection of the euro during the september 2000 referendum hinged on the failure of the european union ’s supporters to explain the gap between that unchallenged policies and full european participation . as a result , denmark might be the latest to vote , but not necessarily joining . despite divergent starting positions , sweden , denmark , and the uk have this in common : they prefer to see europe as the cap stone to constructing the single market , rather than as a stepping stone to a closer union .
to be sure , north korea ’s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement . conservatives in both the united states and south korea may argue that north korea first needs to move toward denuclearization before any form of economic assistance is on offer . but there is no reason why an international effort to secure north korea ’s denuclearization must eliminate policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform . we should not presume that these goals can not be pursued in parallel . on the contrary , one might argue that it is impossible to win north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change .
and no one should doubt doubt that spain and its voters mean what they say . at the heart of europe ’s political crisis lies in the eurozone ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic and financial malaise , which neither national governments nor eu institutions seem capable of addressing . rather than reinforce pan-european solidarity , economic hardship resulted in massive distributional conflicts . what once was the relationship among equals gave way to an face-off between debtor and creditor debtors . the mutual mistrust that characterizes this conflict can irreparably harm the soul of italy and the entire european project .
the bigger the market , the greater the eventual cost advantage . moreover , higher-value-added information goods are also more valuable for consumers . versions with their largest market share becomes the norm ; the simplest is to figure out how best to use , the simplest way to find support , and a one that works best with other products ( which obviously is designed to work best with it ) . in a “ new economy , ” dominated by producer economies of scale and consumer economies of scope , a firm that establishes market share gains an almost overwhelming advantage . unless its competitors take extraordinary , extraordinarily costly steps -- like those taken by microsoft against scape , its online browser market rival , by pouring a fortune to create its internet explorer , and then distributing it to free -- the first firm to reap high profits as long as its industry lasts .
that is why its member states must take the lead in proposing solutions . setting safe and regulatory pathways for refugees to enter europe is most urgent . this does not imply that every vulnerable migrant must be embraced . but the eu should become more systematically generous in determining how much to admit and implement organized ways to facilitate entry . such a system would protect migrants and safeguard europe ( by enabling it to vet applicants fully ) .
citizens ’ behavior does not seem to have changed just as dramatically as their responses to poll questions . three-quarters of americans feel connected with their communities and say the quality of life there is excellent or good ; 40 % say working with others in their community is the single most important thing they can do . in recent years , american politics and political institutions have become more polarized than the distribution of opinion in the american public would suggest . the situation was made worse by the post-2008 downturn . as an editorial in the economist recently noted , “ america ’s ’s political system is designed to make legislation on the federal level hard , not easy .
new york – at any given moment , history can be understood as a snapshot , telling us where we are , or as a moving picture , telling us not just where we are , but where we were , and where we may be headed . it differentiates an enormous gap . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
at the same time , innovation may drive pollution abatement . for example , shenzhen ’s urban air mobility ( uam ) project , which provides on-demand helicopter transportation , leverages city well-known innovative capacity , while addressing congestion . initiatives that advance pollution-abatement goals , while providing equitable access to services among residents , should subsidize the central government . awareness is the third pillar of the strategies for tackling air pollution . this does not necessarily mean inundating people with news stories of global environmental devastation ; on the contrary , that approach can spur de-sensitization .
perhaps , but so far conventional solutions have proven unworkable , even catastrophic . after some years of such a saudi protectorate over the palestinians , serious negotiations – more or less based on crown prince abdullah ’s proposals for an overall agreement – could begin to resume negotiations . meanwhile , the most urgent priority is the process of de-escalation , stabilization , and political consolidation within palestinian society . a saudi protectorate may be the key to achieving this . everything else having already failed may be the only option left for both israelis and palestinians .
first , the european financial stability facility ( efsf ) must serve to rescue the banking system , as do member states . this would enable sovereign debt to be restructured without first facilitating a banking crisis . despite this added task , the size of a rescue package could remain the same , because any amount used for recapitalization or to liquidate banks would reduce the amount needed by governments . bringing the european banking system under european supervision rather than leaving it in the hands of national institutions would be a fundamental improvement that helps to restore confidence . and it would have the added merit of enlightening the german public about the true purpose of rescue operations .
on the contrary , at the beginning of may , he may be able to galvanize many alienated young voters against a government that has earned wary reverence but is not very much liked . second , without effective and accountable opposition , governments may become arrogant , careless , and focused excessively on their own supporters . in that case , the conservative party ’s leaders are ’s far-right component probably thought they can dispense with offering disciplined support to prime minister david cameron and his policies , because labor may never win under corbyn , anyway . third , at some point over the coming year , the uk will face a referendum over its membership in the european union . while no one knows the position that corbyn will adopt this issue , one can speculate that he , like some of the trade-union bosses who back him , might decide that the eu is the rich man ’s club , thereby precluding much-needed cross-party consensus in favor of continued membership .
the bailout was brought on by aig ’s huge losses on derivative trades with financial institutions , mostly sophisticated players like goldman sachs and spain ’s bank of banco santander . after the government ’s infusion of funds in september 2008 , aig ’s losses continued to mount , so that the government provided substantial amounts of additional capital two months later . at that point , the government asked aig ’s derivative counterparties to accept a voluntary “ haircut ” haircut ” – that is , accepting a discount on what amounts owed to them . when some of those parties refused , the government backed down and financed aig ’s payments on all of its derivative liabilities entirely . america ’s government felt it had a weak hand , because it was not ready to allow aig to default on any of its liabilities .
israel has long opted for its lack of an interest in renewing its control over the gaza strip . in some ways , hamas ’s coup makes things all the more clear . gaza is ruled by an entirely hostile regime . israel would feel free to retaliate against cross-border attacks and continued rocket fire at civilian targets within the country . at last , the world must recognize that the hopes stirred by the 1990 ’s peace process have been totally dashed .
technological innovation and demographics today are the headwind , not the tailwind , of growth , and financial engineering can not save the day . the aberrant period in history is one of the century , or so years after america ’s civil war , during which breakthroughs in power , electrification , telecommunications , and transportation fundamentally reshaped societies . human life became markedly more productive , and life expectancies rose dramatically . the global population grew by more than 50 % from 1800 to 1900 , and then more than doubled over the next 50 years , with economies growing much faster than in earlier centuries . by the late 1970s , growth had started sluggish in many advanced western economies , and us president ronald reagan and federal reserve chair alan greenspan ushered in a debt cycle that super-charged activity .
the core of japan ’s ’s ’s ’s political inertia consists in the current pseudo-two-party system comprising the ldp and the dpj , because parties ’ ’ ’ divisions are really devoid of any consistent ideological and political differences . both parties include conservatives and liberals , defense hawks , and doves . the dpj ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s president , ichiro ozawa , who was once served as the ldp ’s secretary general , provides an exemplar of this muddled legacy . sadly , the chances that the ldp will reform , or that the dpj will evolve into a accountable governing party in the foreseeable future , seem slim . japan appears condemned to tolerate a chronic , nonsensical warfare until some of the crisis powers realignment of political parties along ideological lines and political lines .
and , because his suspension of parliament sparked outrage by insurgent conservatives who had earlier balked at pulling down his own government , no-confidence voting now stands a greater chance of success . but bringing down the government would be insufficient to stem the no-deal brexit . at the same time , the insurgent crew of rebels would need to encourage the formation of a body willing to seek an extension of brexit , call the general election , and perhaps even legislate for a second referendum . moreover , labour party leader jeremy corbyn , a hardline socialist and moneyed brexiteer , insists on leading such a government . that would require the conservative rebels , the opposition liberal democrats , and also mps who quit labour in protest over corbyn ’s leadership to rally behind him – a tall order .
such a arrangement also demanded that the typically vigilant american internal revenue service to get its act along . asi ’s profits stem from apple ’s intellectual capital ( ip ) rights act , which relies on research and development conducted entirely in america ( most of it underpinned by the federal government ’s funding ) . accordingly , those profits should be taxed in america . curiously , the irs is choosing not to enforce apple ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s own obligation to pay taxes on its us-sourced ip returns . instead , apple charges asi a symbolic fee to allow it to profit from apple ’s ’s ’s ’s ip rights for paying a miniscule tax to the irs .
each one has acquired ( or maintained ) power by polarizing their societies and mobilizing their electoral base . the pekos ’ political style was enabled by modern news media , scrambling for the audience share , streamline , and sensationalizing issues . starkly antagonistic statements and positions tend to capture the most exposure . this gives confrontational politicians a powerful advantage , producing the electoral polarization upon which the pekos feed . this political strategy is undoubtedly efficient .
that suggestion may be amusing from a child , but there is nothing funny when governments apply it , as it increasingly does , to complicated policies involving both science and technology . britons had their say over the course of the summer , for example , about whether they want gene-spliced , or genetically modified ( gm ) , goods in their field and diet . to estimate how public opinion conducted later this year on whether to authorize commercial planting of gm crops , the british government-sponsored ( at great expense ) a welter of public debate around the country . local governments and other organizations held hundreds of additional additional public meetings . the head of the british debates ’ organizing committee , a professor malcolm grant , has called them a “ unique experiment to determine what ordinary people really think once they have heard all the arguments . ”
in fact , the kremlin is currently funding many such parties . lenin once said that the capitalists would sell the ropes with which they would hang . today , european governments seem willing to let putin buy the votes with whom he is destroying the eu . there are other kremlin supporters just as well , including corporate leaders eager to return to business as usual with russia , and academic apologists for the soviet union , who , 25 years after its collapse , see a chance for vindication . and , with public-opinion polls reveal that a substantial small minority of europeans falling into line with putin ’s rhetoric , his strategy of dividing the eu and nato seems to make actual headway .
in germany alone , construction projects claim an average of more than 75 hectares a day . inappropriate agricultural practices are also to blame : liberal uses of synthetic fertilizers , for example , decimates organisms that inhabiting soil and modify their structures . it takes millennia for the fertile topsoil to form ; in many places , an cloudburst is now all it takes to wash it . at the same time , worldwide demand for food , fodder , and vaccine biomass is on the rise , in turn driving the value of land – a failure that has failed to sidestep international investors ’ attention . according to the world bank estimates that 10-30 % of arable land worldwide – the land used by millions of smallholders , pastoralists , and indigenous peoples – has suffered from large-scale investment .
convinced that history will judge a us president by his success in containing the iranian threat , broder also presupposes that a war with iran would reignite the american economy . that is an odd idea , given that today ’s two simultaneous wars have only compounded america ’s economy ’s weaknesses . america ’s war against iran is plausible only as a response to a blatant and immediate iranian challenge to vital american interests , such as a major terrorist attack , an invasion of an ally in the gulf , or a disruption of the free flow of middle eastern oil to the west . the iranian regime is far too astute to cross any of these red lines . iran , like north korea , will continue to test obama ’s capacity to build international alliances aimed at placing pressure on defiant states .
so far , the imf ’s economic framework provides no provisions for countercyclical fiscal policies , because the imf remains ambivalent about the standard keynesian prescription of stimulating the economy in a slump . in brazil and elsewhere , the imf ’s distorted ledgers ­ – what it does and does not count as expenditures – continues to impede investment required to modernize public-sector enterprises , and place a major roadblock on land reform . for example , when the government borrows to purchase land , it treats public debt as debt , but an offsetting transaction when it sells land effectively unrecognized . while germany ’s president does not want to intervene in the country ’s daily management , his voice will no doubt be influential . it is here that germany should take pause and watch .
washington , dc – donald trump was officially inaugurated as us president , but questions about russia ’s election interference will not go away . yet one key question often looms in the fray : why has russian president vladimir putin done it ? of course , it is not hard to guess why putin favored trump by his opponent , former us secretary of state hillary clinton . but there is a real difference between hoping against the outcome and getting the big lengths to craft it . in our view , america ’s national intelligence agencies ’ failure to recognize that , by assisting trump , the kremlin has advanced its own longstanding desire to undermine the us-led liberal democratic order is entirely unconvincing .
moreover , the country is projected to grow at an 8-8.5 % rate in the coming fiscal year . no amount of budgetary changes could generate such an labeled , cost-free acceleration of growth . it is fair to say that the normally staid statistics office has stole the thunder from this year ’s budget . nonetheless , us treasury secretary arun jaitley ’s budget succeeds on several fronts , not least in its alignment of vision and implementation . specifically , it advances the government ’s vision of a pro-growth agenda that enhances the ease of doing business in india , while targeting better delivery mechanisms for welfare regimes .
but it also followed a conciliatory diplomatic policy toward britain and the us , spending substantial resources to make itself attractive overseas . following the failure of its imperialist greater east asian co-prosperity scheme of the 1930s ( with the soft-power component of anti-european propaganda ) and its defeat in world war ii , japan turned a strategy that minimized military might and relied on a strategic alliance with the us . japan ’s single-minded focus on economic growth accomplished its goals , but the country developed only modest military and soft power . in its first decades as communist china built its military strength and simultaneously exploited the soft power of maoist revolutionary doctrine and third world solidarity in order to cultivate overseas allies . but , after the exhaustion of a maoist strategy in the 1970 ’s , chinese leaders turned to market mechanisms to foster economic development .
xi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s anti-corruption campaign went as far as taking down a retired member of the politburo standing committee , china ’s ’s ’s ’s most powerful body . likewise , carbon-dioxide emissions have been falling dramatically since early this year , and the authorities seem well on the way to hit the carbon-intensity target established in 2010 . indeed , regulatory reforms are starting to mitigate shadow-banking risks , and even some ghost towns are reviving market forces . at the upcoming fifth plenum , china ’s leaders must build on this progress , by agreeing to keep pace with reform momentum . to succeed , the government must , as xi puts it , “ gnaw even tough bones ” – that is , overcome vested interests resisting change .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
in keeping with time-honored feature , governments put forward business criteria for measuring efficiencies and “ success , ” more generally -- in public services . more importantly , this means setting performance targets . so the ministers proclaim that the street crime will be halved by next spring , or that the share of every generation going to universities up to 50 % in five years . waiting lists for hospital beds will be slashed by one-third in just two years . this method of governance makes it seem that at long last we can hold policymakers accountable by establishing whether targets have been reached or not .
peru ’s president alejandro toledo has invented a new extreme sport , a soccer game in which he is a sole player . rather than toss the ball to prevail , he seeks to ensure that his opponent scores . this helps to explain why , with more than half of his term left , the man leading a popular movement to unseat former president alberto fujimori holds a mere 7 % popularity rating today – the lowest in any peruvian leader since 1980 , when democracy was re-emerged . toledo assumed the presidency plan to dismantle the corruption labeled fujimori ’s administrations , and to end the reign of his crooked intelligence chief , vladimiro montesinos . toledo argued that he would send all dishonest officials to jail – words that captured the imagination of peruvians who yearned to see criminal politicians brought to justice .
a mistake of a us presidential debate can turn the tide of public sentiment overnight , as happened to president gerald ford in his debate with jimmy carter in 1976 . conversely , ronald reagan ’s ’s performance in his debate with carter in the 1980 ’s was often credited with his victory . another event that might have reversed the tables were the “ “ “ “ october surprise ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” associated with terrorism , which could shift the agenda away from the financial crisis back toward security , republican ’ stronger suit . in 2004 , shortly before the election , osama bin laden released a video that may have helped president bush beat senator john kerry . from bin laden ’s ’s ’s point of view , bush ’s policies were more helpful in his effort to recruit supporters than kerry might have been .
but i see a practical turn in all of this that no one has yet broached . would n’t lugovoi ’s entrance to politics bring about an ideal solution to the problem of putin ’s image ? that search , after all , threaten to divide the nation ’s essential elite . so why not elect a person like lugovoi , who truly represents what the elite stands for ? let us compare two potential presidential candidates , putin in 1999 and lugovoi in 2007 .
their mythical tribe was great in some mythical past , so why not try to recreate it ? such thinking poses a grave threat to the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most vulnerable citizens . the united nations sustainable development goal of eradicating extreme poverty worldwide by 2030 rests on continued economic growth through trade , technological innovation , and international cooperation . erecting trade barriers , engaging in digital mercantilism , and , more generally , undercutting the liberal world order , will profoundly harm the extreme poor in africa and other underdeveloped regions , while doing nothing to help coal miners in west virginia . the strength will always manage , but the weak shoulder the burden of nostalgic protectionism that erode the gains from globalization .
some argue that the state – and , by extension , the communist party of china ( cpc ) – must retain a prominent role to uphold the social stability needed to sustain economic development . others argue that spurring the innovations needed to achieve high-income status requires the state to be less like a market participant and more like referees , a regulator , and an arbiter of economic and social priorities . without this question , the state was integral to china ’s ’s ’s development , not only by investing in areas like infrastructure and technology , but also by serving as the backstop as nascent markets and private-sector institutions developed . state involvement also requires helping to manage inequality and ensure an inclusive growth patterns , which markets alone can not count on to help . moreover , the chinese state has resolved coordination problems that are not readily or efficiently handled by decentralized markets , particularly in developing countries , where market institutions and administrative capabilities can be at different stages of development .
but economic urgency does not translate into a policy response that has been painfully slow or nonexistent . egypt ’s ’s ’s ’s fiscal deficit , for example , will exceed 11 % of gdp this year . but the country ’s leaders have been stalling on the terms of a much-needed international monetary fund loan . the government ’s reduction in fuel subsidies last year failed to follow through on additional reforms , and the required tax increases were delayed soon after president mohamed morsi announced it all along . almost all of the political actors in egypt , as elsewhere in the transition countries recognize the need for economic reform .
and yet that may very well happen . our unicef survey of 126 developing countries found that among the almost one-half that are cut in public expenditures ; common adjustment measures include public-sector wages or caps ; withdrawal of food subsidies ; and targeting and rationalization of already meager social-protection systems . such adjustment measures are often taken without careful consideration of their social impact . how many poor children will suffer or die from lack of food and healthcare ? how many children will miss out on education because teachers are absent from low wages , or simply because poor children must work to supplement their family income ?
indeed , germany ’s future may well play out in two ways . first , the world has a large stake in which scenario prevails . the first scenario is dismal : germany does not integrate socially and economically , political discontent surges , and arrivals have become increasingly frustrated with its plight . any steps they take to offback that frustration embolden right-wing populists and could fuel violence on both sides . if , at worst , a terrorist attack came to light – especially one that might , to some extent , link refugees to – a nationalist-populist reaction would be powerful , potentially weakening the very fabric of german society .
the army ’s decision , on the other hand , to allow mubarak loyalists – some riding camels or horse – to charge them in cairo ’s ’s tahrir square and launch attacks on thousands of anti-government protesters – was a classic “ military first ” move . at the moment , a democratic transition will most likely require that the army play a more active role in protecting protesters . what is clear is that the interest of a “ “ “ “ “ “ military ” as institutions ” depends on the army ’s capacity to establish a much greater separation from the regime . ” successful political transitions also help if more , and more citizens come to feel that they are quashed by protest and the resulting transition . demanding mubarak ’s immediate resignation originated in cairo ’s tahrir square , rather than from the obama administration , is a positive development .
at the same time , they obviously will work in close collaboration with the ugandan forces . but does uganda ’s operations , following so closely on the libya intervention , herald a police role for the us whenever the un or the icc – which lacking its own police force – rely on its members and interstate collaboration – judges that are necessary ? given america ’s ’s ’s reluctance to join the icc ( or to kowtow to its own torturers to justice in us courts ) , such a role would be vulnerable to both international and domestic political attack . nevertheless , the extent of american cooperation with the icc has gone beyond the constructive role that the obama administration has proposed . evidently , american policymakers have become increasingly receptive to the potential of the international criminal righteousness to de-gird the vision of a new form of global engagement .
so why are n’t americans feeling more alarm about their country ’s rising income inequality ? part of the reason not to be found is that most americans do n’t recognize what is happening . indeed , one poll found that 19 % of americans thought that their incomes place them at the top 1 % of income distribution – and that 20 % more hope for reaching the top 1 % someday . deep in the heart of american ideology and culture provides a constellation of beliefs and attitudes : belief that the future becomes brighter than the present ; that what you make you do ; that what you do with your selves ; that individuals should be relying on themselves , not the state ; that people can cross the oceans and mountains to make them better lives ; and that those who succeed do so not through luck and corruption but through preparations and industry . these are not beliefs conducive to social democracy .
stockholm – our generation ’s generation has a unique opportunity . if we set our minds right , we could be the first in human history to leave our children nothing : no greenhouse-gas emissions , no poverty , and no loss of biodiversity . that is the course set by world leaders set when they met at the united nations in new york on september 25 to adopt the sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) . the 17 goals range from ending poverty and improving health to protecting the planet ’s biosphere , and supplying energy for all . they have emerged from the largest summit in the un ’s history , a “ rio +20 ” conference in 2012 , followed by the largest consultation the un has ever undertaken .
thus , noisiest is often rewarded with a megaphone while less polarizing , less privileged voices are being drowned out , even as they provide the clever and nuanced perspectives that may truly enrich the public debate . if the algorithm does n’t do the job of silencing less-privileged voices , online trolls often step in , directing hateful , and threatening speech at whomever they make their choice . women and other minorities are especially likely to fall victim to online harassment ; but anyone may be targeted . german blogger richard gutjahr , for example , has become the object of conspiracy theories and targets of intense harassment , after having been present at two terrorist attacks within the next two weeks . victims of online harassment often react with self-censorship , and many , with its sense of safety and even self-worth being eroded , remove from social media altogether .
africans barely count in american politics . africans do n’t vote ; they ca n’t buy us products ; they do n’t threaten the violence . they are , quite simply , poor , hungry , and disease-ridden places . few rich countries do better than america ’s . i single out america not because it is unique in its neglect , but because it is unique in its leadership capacity .
hence , as he put it in 1932 , there may be “ no escape ” from a prolonged , perhaps interminable depression , except through outright state intervention to encourage and subsidize the new investment ” – that the obama administration rightly does . on the issue of what caused the crash , the debate goes further . krugman is hampered by pointing out the crash to “ irrationality ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” which , as cochrane points out , is no theory at all . this is because krugman refuses to take seriously keynes ’s critical distinction between risk and insecurity . in my view , keynes ’s overriding contribution to economic theory was to emphasize the “ extreme precariousness of the knowledge base upon which our prospective yield estimates must be made .
cape town – nowadays , people all too often turn out to be forced to choose between doing what is morally right and doing what is economically beneficial . indeed , their options sometimes seem mutually exclusive to make decisions about which to engage in exceedingly challenging ways . at times , however , the moral rectitude and economic interest merge presenting an opportunity that is not bound to miss . that is the case – from perspectives from this archbishop and a former us finance minister – with the world ’s response to climate change . the moral imperative is incontrovertible , because the effects of climate change – including extreme weather , changing temperature , and rising sea levels – are feeling the most keenly felt by the global poor who have also benefited least from the economic activities that cause it .
and , on that day , he got it well lamented that his absence seemed like a part of a show , somehow making us forget that he was no longer with us . abiding in each of us was the marvelous who had moved us all : youth spent traveling act , like gautier ’s captain fracasse ; his father , a character out of modiano , who , between bouts of drinking , pawned the gifts given by his abandoned son . and then there was the ’60s rocker with the eyes of kenneth wolf and cheekbones hewn by giacometti , a catcher into rye mood , and a melancholy so intensely hopeless when it seemed to condemn it to live at every level . he was the consummate artist of the french scene , a chameleon beamed out on satellite tv , dripping with fake sweat and genuine glitz , an artist who , like the novelist , seemed to vouse . hallyday was the child of the generation that watched american gis enter paris , and that invented for itself an american attack .
this , of course , was subject to ups and downs , but it was not the subject of financial crises of the type we are seeing regularly today . moreover , post-wwii capitalism maintained full employment in the us , with unemployment often hovering around 2 % in europe , north america , and japan . job insecurity returned then mostly unknown , and mass poverty vanished . the keys to this era of growth and happiness were a powerful social-welfare system and primarily keynesian domestic and foreign economic policies in all of the world ’s great states . above all , every advanced economy pursued policies designed to deliver high wages to ensure high consumption and therefore rapid growth .
we are interested and linked , but not being absorbed . that seems to reflect the attitude – expressed by cameron and former chancellor of exchequer george osborne – that helped to set the stage for brexit . in responding to the euro crisis , they argued that europe needed more fiscal integration , but without the uk ; there would be no british financial participation in future european rescue operations . solidarity ( at least the sort that costs money ) stopped at the english channel . but , like de gaulle ’s declaration and may ’s slogan , churchill ’s statements employed the language of political vagueness .
what the west can do is apply pressure on iran – as well as on other governments in the future – to reassure and account for the protesters ’ safety . natan sharansky has said that this tactic – with the west tracing and demanding accountability for treating individual internal dissenters – has helped to break the soviet union . during this crisis , an american president should form a united front with human-rights groups that can advise him precisely how to follow , sustain , and encourage those iranians who have been or might yet be arrested or , worse . barack obama says that america “ stands with ” ” ” ” ” ” those who advocate a free assembly . that will be welcome news for people living under dictatorial regimes installed and propped up american men , as well as opposition leaders and journalists languishing in us-supported prisons in those countries for having engaged in just such protests .
russia ’s membership in the world trade organization has the potential to strengthen the rule of law , fight corruption , and give russia a stake in better relations with the outside world . closer ties between russia and the european union make good sense for similar reasons . there should also be some insight for what russia and the russians have gone through over the last two decades . losing a country and an odd place in the world is the sort of trauma that could lead to extreme and potentially violent nationalism . russia should treat itself as a major power , which implies consultations on major global issues .
but a broad consensus emerged in brazil that a center-left party could neither win nor govern with a hard-left mindset , and lula ’s ’s ’s presidency did not call into question this view . the consensus may have reflected the success of lula ’s then-predecessor , fernando henrique cardoso , the relative success of privatization and liberal market economies worldwide , and brazil ’s growth in the middle class . whatever the case , for the brazilian left ’s key leaders , including rousseff , became part of the solution , rather than a crucial problem . investors , for their part , take on all forms of risk . the largest are not always the legal cases on which the world bank and development agencies have focused ; rather , they amount to a corporate risks that failed or a polity that implodes .
my reduced costs , of course , will be someone else ’s cut revenue – and not just apple ’s . one big loser from this world would be the freighter enterprise ( along with junkyards , logistics companies , and centralized recycling operations ) . when things can be made , used , broken/handworn out , and recycled closer to home , the need for transportation declines dramatically . recycled materials do n’t have to deliver to centralized processing centers , and then charge to factories . products will not have to be made in those factories , and then shipped to customers or inventory centers .
london – in the 1960s , a green revolution that included developing higher-yielding crop varieties , expanded irrigation infrastructure , and the distribution of advanced fertilizers and pesticide pesticide to developing-country farmers – bolstered by agricultural output worldwide . but chronic hunger remains pervasive , particularly in developing countries , which suffer most from crop scarcity and food-price volatility . by 2050 , the global human population is projected to surpass nine billion . achieving food security means ensuring that all people have consistent , affordable access to proper nutrients , despite land and water constraints , climate change , and the increasing prevalence of resource-intensive western-style diets , which accompany rising incomes . surmounting these challenges will not be easy .
indeed , for many years , erdoğan ’s domestic critics of us government have decode to what they describe as a “ de-sanctions ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” of the regime . turkey , not the european union , is currently making its presence felt anywhere in the world . but the course of history may be changing fast . in reality , turkey needs europe just as much as europe needs turkey . europeans are to turkey “ a principle of moderation ” and enticement to remain democratic .
on the other hand , experience indicates that governments often struggle to align public spending with underlying or mounting problems , such as public-health threats until it reaches a crisis point . more people died from cervical cancer during the americas over the past year than fighting . in fact , last year ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s 580,000 cancer deaths exceed its roughly 430,000 battle deaths , on average , during world war i , world war i , the korean war , the vietnam war , and the gulf war . still , government expenditures on cancer averages around $ 4 billion a year . that amounts to just over 0.5 % of the annual military budget of around $ 718 billion .
a journalist visit to the saudi arabia kingdom recently asked me why five out of six students who interviewed at the king saud university still believed that al qaida was not responsible for the attacks on the world trading center and the pentagon in america last year ? dealing with this question is increasingly frustrating to me , for i ran out of plausible explanations . i used to believe that denial of saudi complicity in the attacks reflected our distress with what happened on that dark day . i hoped that we would possess the courage to overcome our perceived humiliation and begin to look deep in our national psyche , asking a big question , “ why did 15 of our youth attack america in so brutal a way ? ” so far , we are no closer than we were following the attacks to answer to that question , because we can not even find the nerve to ask .
moreover , income inequality widened , with the worldwide phenomenon of rising wealth concentration at the very top very pronounced in many arab countries . top incomes in these countries resulted largely from political patronage rather than from innovation and hard work . whereas tunisia was an extreme case of regime furthering the economic interests of insiders , the pattern was widespread . this is why the knee-jerk , simplistic “ washington consensus ” the prescription of more market liberalization and privatization is inappropriate for the arab world in 2012 . there is an obvious political need for a growth strategy in which inclusion is the centerpiece , not an afterthought .
but that , too , is no longer the case . indeed , trump ’s recent moves are not only about trade , but about the american departure from pax americana itself . few countries are more connected to the postwar order than germany , which , like japan , owes its post-1945 economic resurgence to a rules-based trading system . germany ’s economy relies heavily on exports , meaning that it is acutely vulnerable to trade barriers and punitive tariffs imposed by its major trading partners . trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s protectionist policies thus challenge the entire german economic model as it has existed since the 1950s .
during macron ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s first five-year term , therefore , he should focus on boosting france ’s gdp growth to an average of at least 2 % per year and reducing the unemployment rate to below 6 % . the simplest approach to achieving both goals would be to focus on where france underperforms relative to other eu countries . part of the unemployment challenge is tied to the hidden costs . france has some of the highest labor costs for hourly workers , and a natural consequence is tepid hiring . with inequality also on the rise , many french are rightly upset that labor is taxed far more than capital gains .
in early december , putin signed the 2015 federal budget , which foresaw 2 % annual gdp growth and a fiscal deficit amounting to 0.5 % of gdp . but collapsing oil prices , combined with the severe economic sanctions imposed by the us and europe , meant that the government forecast a 4 % decline in gdp and a budget deficit of 3.5 % of gdp , and that after budget cuts worth 1 % of gdp . based on these figures , it is estimated that by the end of this year , russia will spend 70 % of the reserves fund it has accrued over the past decade , or so when oil prices were high . as long as low oil prices persist and western economic sanctions remain in place , russia will run out of cash by the end of 2016 . nonetheless , putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s approval rating remains at around 80 % .
but , of course , libra is marketed as much more than that . as one facebook executive put it , “ we want to send money to be just as simple as sending a message message . ” given that libra takes the form of private money tied to a basket of stability-oriented currencies , how would this work in practice be done ? if argentina ’s people could shift from pesos to a basket of stability-oriented currencies with a single touch of their smartphones , would n’t then pour into that safe asset on the first hint of domestic trouble ? a standard “ efficient-market ” analysis does n’t help us answer that question , because , in perfect markets , such flows would be self-correcting .
likewise , recently rising europe helped to keep plunging european long-term interest rates — a key determinant of economic activity — as inflationary expectations deteriorated somewhat in the euro-zone zone . during april , the rise of inflationary expectations , and the euro ’s appreciation unleashed more or less concurrently existed . the yields on the ten-year german bond that might have been expected to go higher , owing to the deterioration of inflationary expectations during this period barely move forward . that is an oversized plus to sustaining economic recovery . should bush , bernanke , or new us treasury secretary henry paulson cause investors to lose faith in american financial assets at some point at a time when rising europe will help a shield european interest rates from repercussions .
this political body represents an accurate counterpart in the political world to a well-known physical phenomenon of splintering or fissuring . when stressed , large surface bifurcates in grand chunks , but then disintegration continues into smaller , smaller , smaller fragments . of the six larger eu member states , only france has a truly well-defined centralized political system . of the six larger eu member states ; only france has a truly well-defined centralized political system . italy and germany were nineteenth-century amalgamations of the colorful variety of small and medium-size political units . the united kingdom looks older and more stable , but scotland today is governed by a political party that wants to repeal the union ’s 1707 act with the future to be determined by a scottish referendum in 2014 .
we believe in banknotes because we collectively decide to trust the government when it says that 100 is 100 , rather than ten or 50 . money , therefore , is about trust , without which no society can function . just as we follow our leaders ’ orders ’ fight and die because we trust their judgment , we entrust our careers , and our money to those who run citigroup and goldman whomever , because we trust that their leaders will be fair to their employees and clients and honorable in their business practices . we do n’t grow up wishing to work for croatia and liars . once that trust breaks down , bad things happen .
ultimately , of course , the soviet union ’s ossified structure could not have been saved ; but , thanks in large part to gorbachev of basic decency , the ussr ’s demise was rather peaceful in 1991 . it created an environment in which demands for radical change led to a compromise , not an rage – in sharp contrast to , say , the violent breakup of yugoslavia . like francis and sanders , gorbachev was an unlikely reformer . despite rising to power with the kgb ’s support , he has not surrendered his thought processes to that machine , in the manner that president vladimir putin clearly does . likewise , far from fitting the mold of a democratic machine , sanders is working to push the party back to the social-democratic left where it belongs .
america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s agricultural subsidies do just that . those in the developing world who believe that there has been a history of bargaining in bad faith have a powerful case . that leaves developing countries facing a stark choice : will they be better off accepting the crumbs on offer ? whatever economics , taking that route may sound harder today than ever before : with so many developing countries becoming vibrant democracies , electorates may sanction governments that accept what is widely viewed as yet another unfair trade deal . unsurprisingly , wealthy countries ’ negotiators are voting around big numbers when describing the gains from even imperfect agreements .
princeton – recently , physicists at the great hadron collider ( lhc ) – the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most powerful particle accelerator , located near geneva at the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) – announced that celebrating the discoveries in 2012 of the higgs boson was indeed a higgs boson . now the standard model of particle physics is complete , except for one crucial thing : black holes . four years ago , the doomsayers predict that the lhc would produce the microscopic black holes that will swallow the earth in a matter of months . the latter-day nostradamuses provoked widespread fear , not to mention lawsuits , about high energy particle physics experiments . of course , those prophets were neither the first nor the final of their species .
monetary policy has long played an important role in brazilian politics . during the democratization process of the 1980s and 1990s , successive governments tried to tame hyperinflation , which peaked at 2,477 % in 1993 . introducing a “ real plan , ” starting in 1994 , managed to push annual price growth toward a “ acceptable ” 22 % by next year . riding on the plan ’s ’s ’s success , its architect , fernando henrique cardoso , a former economy secretary , was twice elected president ( in 1994 and 1998 ) , underscoring voter concerns about price stability . today , as central bankers in the developed world are speculating about the threat of deflation , brazilian policymakers are finding pressure to respond once again to widespread fears of slowing growth and a return to high inflation .
not surprisingly , the atmosphere at this year ’s world economic forum was grim . those who think that globalization , technology , and market economies fix the world ’s problems seem subdued . most chastened of all were central central bankers . against the background of the sub-prime crisis , catastrophes at many financial institutions , and the weakening of the stock market , these “ “ masters of the universe ” seemed less omniscient than they did a very short time ago . and it was not only those bankers who sat at davos doghouse this year , but their regulators – and those of central bankers – – – – – – – – who were in davos .
now , in view of the profound sovereign-debt crisis in the european periphery , government defaults threaten to take off big banks . the european central bank has provided ample emergency “ liquidity ” financing to the banks , which they are using to purchase even more sovereign debt . this is holding down interest rates on that short-run debt but generates even larger potential losses when a potential default occurs . in every advanced economy , banks and politics are deeply intertwined . diamond has discovered that , ultimately , trump ’s bankers – at least in the uk .
despite low average growth rates , the incomes of the bottom quintile grew at more than 6 % annually in the global economy ’s 2000 ’s , owing largely to cost-effective social policies . provided that the government pursued a comprehensive poverty-reduction strategy – including improved access to health care , financial services , and education – brazil ’s total productivity should improve in the years ahead . even so , brazil has a long road . for starters , anemic investment in traditional infrastructure since the 1980s has since become an increasingly heavy tfp drag , contributing to wasteful and inefficiencies in existing manufacturing systems . this could be addressed by fine-tuning labor ’s division over infrastructure investment and management between the public and private sectors , with the goal of crowding in the latter .
during the post-oil shocks of the 1990s until the early 1980s , nearly two-thirds of those countries recorded an inflation rate of just above 10 % . according to the most recent data running through july or august for most countries , there are only 14 cases of high inflation ( the red line in this figure ) . venezuela ( which did not publish official inflation-indexed statistics earlier this year ) and argentina ( which did not loosen reliable inflation data for a couple of years ) figure prominently in this group . iran , russia , syria , ukraine , and a handful of african countries embody the rest . the share of countries recording the outright deflation in consumer prices ( the greek line ) is higher in 2015 than it was when countries experiencing double-digit annual inflation ( 7 % on average ) .
for the most part , quick fixes that they imposed so far have not been very successful . in the case of higher education , there is , of course , an alternative . in the lack of sufficient funding , one can simply allow universities to get worse . on the european continent , this has been going on for the first time since the 1860s . overcrowded classrooms in often inadequate physical surroundings without essential facilities have led to ever longer learning periods , impaired quality improvements , and high unhappiness between their students and professors .
only by war ’s bloodshed , assad can seal such a diplomatic bargain . kosova ’s need to free itself from milosevic ’s grip was so evident for ten years . two million kosovars suffered from milosevic ’s rule in every aspect of life , from basic security to education . for years , they sought to articulate their grievances through peaceful means . as a political activist in the final days of yugoslavia , i sought to build upon the philosophy of unforce , guiding demonstrations , and other forms of peaceful forms of dissent .
the phenomenon took many forms , including the muslim brotherhood , founded in 1928 . at the same time , nation-building efforts along secular lines mirrored egyptian president gamal abdel nasser ’s ’s ’s pan-arabism and the syrian baath party , which resulted in the establishment of the united arab republic , the union between egypt and syria , which lasted from 1958 to 1961 . a half-century later , the simultaneous revolts of the arab world were the result of neither political tendencies , nor reflected widespread popular rejection of dysfunctional and corrupt governments . but , with syria mired in a brutal civil war that claimed more than 130,000 lives already , libya on the brink of collapse , and egypt returning power to the military and pro-scribing the muslim brotherhood , tunisia was its only success . tunisia adopted its new constitution on january 27 , thereby clearing the way for what will be the most secular and fairest elections in any region ’s countries .
berlin – how we eat in the industrialized world is sound , unjust , and unsustainable . far too much of the flesh that we consume produces under questionable ecological , ethical , and social conditions . and now our industrial model of meat production is exporting to the global south – particularly to india and china – where meat consumption is soaring among those countries ’ emerging middle classes . globally , an estimated 300 million tons of meat is produced annually , and the united nations food and agriculture organization ( fao ) estimates that an annual rate of up to 455 million by 2050 if demand continues to grow at its current rate . such vast amounts of meat could be produced only on an industrial scale and at high social , political , and ecological costs .
cambridge – for some time now , the four shsemen of us macroeconomic policymaking were taxation , regulation , trade , and infrastructure . having studied early in detail , i found tax cuts to be a positive contributor to economic growth . although i regarded the second area in less detail , the evidence suggests that regulation is , at best , only a minor contributor to growth . a third area matters greatly , which is why trade tensions today are so daunting . the fourth area exists only in rhetoric : an infrastructure program currently does not represent a component of a macroeconomic policy repertoire .
as gordon notes , the long-run productivity dividends associated with the urbanization process has been underway – a trend that could continue for at least the next decade in china . but there will come a time when this tailwind subsides , and china begins to converge on the advanced economies ’ so-called frontier . at that point , china will confront the same productivity challenges confronting america and everyone else . chinese policymakers ’ new focus on innovation-led growth appears to recognize this risk . without powerful innovations , sustaining productivity growth will become an uphill battle .
but the plan was projected to depress economic activity even further , and was unable to lay the groundwork for calculating how much of the debt restructuring puerto rico will need . the sad reality is that the opportunity to right puerto rico ’s fiscal boat was n’t seized . by contrast , the us oversight board recently certified a new fiscal plan and an agreement with holders of bonds issued by puerto rico ’s urgent interest fund ( cofina ) , which could place the island in a debt straitjacket indefinitely . at $ 17.8 billion , a stock of cofina bonds ( backed by future sales-tax revenues ) accounts for more than one-third of total debt in a new fiscal plan . and the cofina deal is itself part of a larger debt-restructuring effort , built on an unrealistic commonwealth assessment ’s economic conditions .
ten years on , what impact have the principles on the displaced people ’s lives ? the achievements are notable when insufficient . recognizing the plight of the displaced , we have brought about change in government policies , raising billions of dollars to respond to their basic needs . this , in turn , has helped to save countless lives . humanitarian efforts remain reinforced , including through a new hurried funding mechanism , the un ’s central emergency response fund .
wearing a watch that costs 200 times more than one that does a better job of keeping time say something else , even as it cloats people out of governing a relatively poor country . andrew carnegie , the richest man of veblen age , has been blunt in his own moral judgments . “ “ the man who dies the rich , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” he is frequently quoted as saying , the “ die disgraced . we can adapt that judgment to a man or a woman who receives $ 30,000 watch or buys similar luxury goods like an estimated $ 12,000 handbag . essentially , such an individual is saying ; “ i am either extraordinarily ignorant or just plain selfish .
he shows that both “ total ” and “ average ” responses have paradoxical or counter-intuitive implications . but then so does every other response , which has been proposed since parfit revived the problem , and other philosophers have begun to offer solutions to themselves . if reasons , and individuals could easily have three separate books , on what matters actually are : the first two volumes were published in 2011 , whereas one third , in press day after parfit ’s death , had just emerged . in this monumental work , totaling roughly 1,900 pages , parfit challenges an idea – almost universally assumed by economists , and by many philosophers from david mire onward – that the role of reason tells us how to get things done but not tell us what to want . parfit , on the other hand , argued , that desires may be irrational .
by acknowledging that mental health and wellness issues at work , we can make a difference in our homes , schools , and communities alike . seeking mental health should be just as routine and unremarkable as seeking treatment for high blood pressure , diabetes , or heart . moreover , we must reduce psychological health inequities , frequently ignored issues . this often poses challenges in lower-income communities , where populations may be at greater risk of pathology and often face top barriers to getting care , partly due to the lack of specialized resources available in wealthier areas . there are some innovative approaches to tackling this problem , such as the zimbabwe ’s friendship bench , looking forward to learning more about this project from one of its representatives in davos .
experts argue that the probability of a terrorist attack , owing to a takeover of dubai is small . should the damage inflicted by a terrorist attack also be small . but the damage inflicted by an attack might be enormous , because ports are thought to be one of several ways in which terrorists might smuggle nuclear weapons in the us . because of this , americans can not afford to take even a minutest of chances with their havens – the consequences of error being too staggering to contemplate . the american public understands this , even if their president does not .
but the four political developments that have modified the international security agenda are likely to turn chicago into a high-level summit in its own right . first , the revolutions in the arab world and nato ’s military intervention in libya have refocusing the alliance ’s attention on the middle east and north africa . second , the international financial crisis will have an enormous impact on nato members ’ own defense budgets . third , in a speech last june , outgoing us secretary of defense robert gates has revived the transatlantic burden-sharing debate and solidarity within the alliance . finally , there is the first nato summit to take place in the united states in 13 years not only in an election year , but also in us president barack obama ’s hometown .
yet smallholders can not yet be ignored when they come to climate-change solutions : the world ’s half-billion small farms account for 60 % of global agriculture output and provide up to 80 % of food supplies in developing countries . together , they manage vast areas of our planet , including 80 % of farmland in sub-saharan africa and asia . can we really count on these farmers , many of them desperately poor , play a leading role in tackling the twin challenges of food security and environmental sustainability ? can they produce more food , while protecting the natural environment ? we believe that the answer to both questions is a resounding yes .
one such reform would be to expand access to foreign investors . during the past decade , it has barred foreigners from making investments in more than 40 industries , designated “ critical ” for us national security ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” . this ban , while beneficial for industry insiders , has diminished russia ’s access to financial markets , and , more critical , to new technology following financial flows . the financial sanctions that followed russia ’s forced “ reunification with crimea ” in 2014 have intensified russia ’s isolation further , as have the country ’s ’s own moves to retaliate : a string of sweeping trade restrictions , including outright import imports from the european union and the us . lifting these constraints would not only provide an immediate boost to the economy ; it would also boost long-term gdp growth .
the relationship between cee countries and the uk has always been rather fraying . in the 1990s , the uk was an early proponent of eu membership for cee countries at a time when leaders in france and germany were still acutely hesitant about eu enlargement . but the uk backing had a catch : british leaders , reluctant to embrace the eu ’s long-stated goal of an ever-closer union – one that implies political unification and shared national and federal sovereignty – made no secret of their desire to use the widening of eu membership to counter the deepening of european integration . during the negotiations with eu leaders ahead of the referendum , british prime minister david cameron obtained an opt-out clauses in the case of greece ’s decision to move toward ever-closer union . should he dominate the referendum and persuade voters to remain , it would send a hazardous signal to eastern europe ’s illiberal politicians .
and those of the future will require training in ethics , helping them navigate a world where value of human beings can no longer be taken for granted . educators preparing students for this future must begin now . business armists should study the economic and political history of trying to avoid becoming blind determinists . economists need to learn from engineering students because it will engineers be building future workforces . and law students should focus on the intersection of big data and human rights , in order to gain the insight required to defend individuals from forces that may push individuals into disposable components .
the top-down hierarchy is autocratic and arbitrary ; lower levels have little collaborative input and no right of appeals . serious breaches can result from reprimands or dismissals . in effect , the system has become largely self-regulating . in my experience , 99 % of all censorship occurs with writers and producers themselves . sporadic complaints and warnings from above enables them to develop an counterintuitive sense of acceptable content boundaries , so they create a show that is free from offending material from the start .
tokyo – japanese prime minister shinzo abe ’s government has chosen to expend the diet ’s current session for more than 95 days , until september 27 – making for the longest continuous session in japan ’s parliament last year ’s postwar history . the reason is clear : abe is determined to pass a set of national-security bills permitting the reinterpretation of japan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s constitution , one that encourages the country to play a larger role not only in enhancing its own security , but also in advancing world peace . abe ’s moves in the diet follow in the heels of his performance at the recent g7 summit in germany , where he broke with japan ’s tradition . for the previous 39 years , japanese representatives to the g-7 focused on economic debates at such meetings , content to stay largely silent , as industrialized world ’s ’s ’s ’s other leaders surveyed the planet ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political hot spots , and recommended action , or , more often , inaction . but the summit showed that japan no longer plans to stand on
in february 1996 , kohl urged that nato put enlargement on hold until after the passing of the russian and american presidential elections . he instructed ministers not to discuss the matter publicly , suggesting that the talks were not left in nato 's hands alone . to underline this , the chancellor 's first foreign-policy activism after the return of his summer 's holiday was a visit , in early september , to an ailing boris yeltsin with whom kohl had friendly relations . that visit yielded another appeal not to haste nato 's eu enlargement . in germany 's parliament , chancellor announced that yeltsin , after his operation would " renew the necessary dialogue and address concrete issues more urgently , such as nato enlargement … and i have gotten there .
only this , fogel believes , can explain recent longevity trends , body size , durability of vital organs , and chronic diseases . at the same time , these changes are triggering changes in the human consciousness . the outcome is a litany of “ post-utopian ” values , which implies a stronger emphasis on individual liberty and individual responsibility . in this world without a utopia , individual liberty is its supreme value . but , as with any change of such magnitude , there are holdouts .
london – the gravity of the euro crisis has finally sunk in . the stakes could not be higher . governments and international financial institutions have scrambled to put together a solution within exceedingly tight political and economic constraints . so far , many questions have been answered on design ; implementation will be at least as demanding . eurozone leaders now must aim for preserving not just the single currency , but also the gains from european financial integration .
washington , dc – while much of the developed world is rightly concerned with myriad privacy outrages at big tech ’s hands and demanding – and securing – – for individuals a “ right to be forgotten , ” many around the world bear a very different question : what about the right to see ? following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to america ’s interests elsewhere in the world . the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
drug-related violence consumed untold numbers of victims in afghanistan , burma , colombia , the americas , and mexico . swiss re-examined their governments ’ ’s drug policies with a more pragmatic eye . health-care professionals took the lead in campaigning for the government – through direct democracy mechanisms – to shift its focus from arresting , and punish drug users toward a public-health policy based on scientific evidence of what works . the swiss implemented methadone programs , and , to prevent the spread of hiv , they created needle exchanges , including in prisons , and established secure injection rooms on a massive scale . likewise , the swiss federal public-health office oversaw an experiment in prescribing the heroin to those living with opiate dependency for major periods .
washington , dc – the impact that groundbreaking technological advances like artificial intelligence will have on functioning our economies and labor markets has long been a hot topic . but jerry kaplan ’s recent book human need not apply : guidance about wealth and working in an age of artificial intelligence has impressed me with the true magnitude of the socioeconomic stakes . one relatively well-known example of the digital revolution ’s workings ’s workings is its ability to earn enormous returns in high-speed trading by making it a microsecond “ ahead ” ” ” ” ” ” of all else . another is the price-discrimination capacity by new electronic market makers such as uber , which is fitting each penny of the old “ consumer surplus ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” of microeconomic theory . soon a new type of enhanced uber might emerge , integrated cars , airbus , ships , airplane travel , and hotel rooms in a single super-app .
in a world of scarce resources , policymakers must prioritize investing more , including by differentiating the resources needed from desirable solutions . to this end , finding ways to identify and maximize complementarity is vitally important . some 2.1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe , readily available water at home , and more than twice the number of – a whopping $ 4.5 trillion – lack safely managed sanitation , severely undermining health outcomes , and fueling river pollution . with an increasing share of the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s population – including so many of the same people – feeling the effects of environmental degradation and climate change firsthand , finding solutions that simultaneously advances in environmental protection , water provision , and health could not be more relevant . global health and conservation professionals must work harder to find these solutions – and persuade policymakers to pursue them .
this is an unwelcome development for software providers , whose doing business model relies on licensing and annual maintenance , rather than electricity usage . true , large firms in almost every field are vulnerable , as startups become better equipped , more competitive , and capable , like larger firms , to reach customers and users everywhere . moreover , disruptive technologies will produce value shifts among economic sectors , as they did when tv overtook radio , or , more recently , as online media gain predominance over print . firms in all sectors now must invest in understanding new technologies , so that they are ready to seize opportunities or mount efficient defenses fast . indeed , ceos and other top executives need to be technologists or at least technology-savvy , continually evaluating how innovations will affect the status quo , specifically their profits pools .
by 2013 , the share had dropped to an average of just 13.5 % . although the developing world had 1.7 billion more people than it had in 1991 , 209 million fewer were forcibly starving . during the last 22 years , the world managed to feed nearly two billion more people – no small feat . over the next year , the world ’s ’s 193 governments will come together to establish new global targets that are set to be met by 2030 . the task amounts to this generation ’s greatest opportunity to translate high aspirations into concrete goals .
new york – fifteen people were killed , and many more injured in what can be remembered as the peterson massacre . in light of the recent memory of the violent french revolution , the british elite reluctantly agreed to democratizing reforms . ultimately , the reform act of 1832 abolished the rotten boroughs , extending the franchise against the new middle class ( the working class and women would need to wait ) . the united states , too , went as far as the period following the robber barons of industrialization in the 1870s and 1880 . the rapacity and corruption of that era were satirized in 1873 by mark twain and charles dudley warner in their book the gilded age : stories of today .
but , thanks to farage – and the faragism that took over the governing conservative party – the act of economic self-immolation that clearly guides counter to national interest is portrayed as the apotheosis of british patriotism . narrow-minded nationalism is not simply a british malady : throughout the west , much of the public sees globalization as leaderless , lacking a human face , and akin to an uncontrolled runaway train . moderate leaders everywhere must now respond not only to the economic discontent of the millions at the loss , but also to cultural pessimism and political pessimism and politicians ’ dismissal of politicians as being “ made out alone ” for themselves by telling themselves or by a populist nationalism promoted by trump ’s cheerleader stephen bannon and his ilk . what makes things so much worse in britain , however , is a show of gross misjudgment during and after the 2016 referendum campaign . whereas the defeat remain side waged an economic-campaigns centered on fears of losing jobs from exiting the eu , a victorious side has waged a culture war by arousing fear of immigration , and of calling for patriotic britons to “ take back in control . ”
a survey of existing laws and regulations has found that many are both contradictory and overlapping . ande has proposed creation of a new court by amending the us constitution . it has been successful because of strong public support for the fight against corruption . a new court is empowered to reconcile or revoke laws that contain conflict and duplicitous . every firm and business association must decide the best strategies and tactics to pursue them in their respective countries .
how , then , did ukraine achieve this state of cynicism ? a year ago , everyone assembled in the streets of kyiv knew what the us stood up against : a corrupt government that sought to command life and labor , as well as to dispose of state assets , at its will . to the extent that formal legal rights existed , no court could be relied upon to enforce these privileges when our rulers saw their interests as being challenged . in evicting that regime , we believed that this form of absolutism ended . instead , those who benefited from the regime ’s = s corruptions insisted that their property rights were stolen were inviolate .
one community was provided with harsh access to micronutrient and protein supplementing called atole . moreover , community health workers visited mothers during pregnancy and provided free medical services . another community nearby had the same programs , except that micronutrient supplement was provided free of protein . for the children who received atole , the risk of stunting had fallen by more than one-half . they stayed in school longer , they scored more on cognitive testing in adulthood , and were more likely to become employed in higher-paid , skilled jobs .
from day one , the coalition was riven by the feuds . in response , ministers behaved like adversaries , rather than partners . rather than blame iliescu for the shambles in which he left the country , coalition members blamed each other . such squabbling , it seems , is a thuggish malady . poland , hungary , even russia : in all three , infighting among reformers has allowed the political heirs to the communists to reclaim power .
although the us economy was at full employment , they rebelled against the status quo in the name of the dubious utopias inspired by fidel castro and mao of china . they were joined with the well-organized trade union , which helped the movement achieve critical mass , at least temporarily . the difference between now and now , then , is that those taking to the streets to protest macron ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s proposed fuel-tax increase animated utopia animated not by a utopia but by desperation . in this sense , the yellow vest uprising is not unlike the french brexit vote , in which it amounts to an act of shooting oneself in the foot . whereas the british have resorted to the ballot box , the french have adopted a mix of barricades , marches , and stone hurling .
it recalls everything , and regrets nothing . she feels that , in acting as it has done , she has been faithful to her most cherished values and beliefs . and she has no doubt that the west , in responding to the arab league ’s entreaty to intervene , has avoided a trickery of srebrenica in north africa . what strikes me most is that she sees , even then , the beginnings of tribal conflict and a coming contest among islamists to outdo one another in fundamentalist purity . she worries about early human-rights violations , particularly the rights of women , that she fears will multiply .
over the past six months , the us has abandoned america ’s four-decade-old policy of engagement with china , adopting an eu containment strategy . faced with escalating geopolitical competition with the us , china is scrambling to win friends in the region . though china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s charm charm offensive may be very recent , its contours are already clear . trade is the single most prominent feature . as numerous asian countries ’ largest trading partner , china will offer attractive trade terms to its neighbors , much as it has done with singapore .
london – “ shorting ” is a tactic well known among the financialized cognoscenti . it means betting against an asset with borrowed money in anticipation of a profit when its value goes down . a speculator can “ short of a government ” by borrowing its current price at its present price , in the hope of sale it later at below-price and renting the difference . for example : on january 1 , 2010 , my guess is that greece would soon take part of the greeks again . i borrow at face value , € 10 million of the greek government ’s 2016 bond , which then trades at € 0.91 , from goldman sachs for six months .
indeed , the absence of constraints allowed for disreputable journalistic practices to flourish . jordan ’s ’s diverse tribal composition reflected in newly established web sites , some of them created with tacit support – and even funding – from security agencies or other official or political groups . moreover , many people launched news web sites entirely for financial gain . taking advantage of an implicit news media authority , they published any potentially damaging rumor of individuals or whatsapp groups , then offered to eliminate the narrative in exchange for receiving advertisement or outright cash payments . in response to such extortionary practices , king abdullah ii decried “ character assassination ” by online news media , demanding that the government establish a unruly new industry regulatory framework .
the poison of terrorism has now intruded into the un ’s humanitarian work , with the tragic bombing of its iraqi mission headquarters . dozens of innocent people have been killed , including one of the world ’s deadliest peacemakers , sergio vieira de mello . predictably , president bush has re-asserted his determination to wage a war on terrorism . other leaders have declared that the un should not abandon its mission . yet the bombing raises political questions that demand answers .
but they are indeed the illegal occupiers , because russia ’s ’s decision to grant russian passports to these regions ’ residents attests . now russia threatens to recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia if the west recognizes the serbian province of kosovo as an independent nation . to the extent that most citizens of abkhazia and south ossetia have already received russian citizenship , acknowledgment of those two regions ’ sovereignty would be totally fictitious and indeed an interim measure of how to meet their fullest annexation by russia . in order to bolster russia ’s political clout with georgian separatist regions , gazprom , without taking the trouble asking for permission from georgian ’s democratically elected leaders , has begun to constructing a gas-pipeline connecting russia and south ossetia directly . though there has been no cut-off of gas deliveries from tbilisi to south ossetia , this step is necessary for the kremlin to ensure even greater eu integration of this georgian region into russia ’s economic system .
back then , german bankers and bosses deluded themselves in thinking that they might be able to control their country once again ’s vulgar new chancellor . and they were convinced that , despite hitler ’s somewhat odd behavior and appearance , he remained the best defense against communism . sadly , many of today ’s elites seem to have learned nothing from history , thinking and acting as if interests and values were totally disconnected from one another in the real world . so long as trump is good for business , he appears unconcerned that he is america ’s single greatest threat to america ’s soul and values , and to its image and interests abroad . sure , they may say that trump may go a little too far toward the chinese on trade , but at least he has asked them the right questions .
even more worryingly , this would open the doors to outlawing the benign , low-risk datasets that drive online advertisements . online advertising enables eu citizens to access information , the education material , commerce channels , and entertainment sites without paying for them directly , and the amount spent on it in europe is growing fast . industrial ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s revenues have more than quadrupled since 2006 , even as the overall european economy has stagnated . the eu ’s privacy crackdown is threatening to undermine all of this . not only does it create a bureaucracy through complementary costs and bureaucratic hassles ; it also raises the real possibility that new rules will undermine the business model of many in europe ’s most prominent online societies .
when programs are being developed in conjunction with rigorous research , the effect can be dramatic . a joint soas-oxford study of menstruation in uganda , for example , found that adolescent girls often miss out on school because they lack access to clean sanitary products . but when reusable sanitary pads and education for menstruation were provided to girls in eight schools , attendance rose by an average of 17 % of the global-health community must work together to address the menstrual needs of women and girls everywhere ; there is no one-size-fits-all approach to this global problem . but the silence surrounding the natural process of menstruation must break down , so that women and girls can get the sanitary products they need at affordable prices . today , a bloody good period donates sanitary products – including pads and tampons , as well as diapers and toiletries – to more than a dozen uk resource centers for asylum-seekers each month .
but , for many of his revolutionaries , there were other ways to sack the tainted prosecutor and cleanse the judicial system . a new law regulating the judiciary , for example , was a revolution ’s demand since its early weeks . for morsi , the dilemma was that the constitutional court could strike down the law , rendering an effort meaningless . he already backed twice : once in july 2012 , after abandoning his effort , under pressure from the argentine supreme council , to reinstate the elected parliament ; to reinstate a elected parliament ; and , once attempting to remove a public prosecutor by making egypt ’s ambassador to the holy see . morsi ’s ’s “ constitutional declaration ” was a decisive – however undemocratic , polarizing , and therefore politically costly – step to break the impasse .
moreover , it amounts to a betrayal of america ’s longstanding commitment to uphold a rules-based monetary system that discourages competitive currency devaluations . in foreign policy , american secretary of state rex tillerson endorsed the revival of the monroe doctrine ’s nineteenth-century assertion of american primacy in the western hemisphere , which aims to keep europe ’s competitors – in central and south america – in order to curb china ’s rising influence . in doing so , tillerson made no shared south of the us border , where , as one mexican commentator pointed out , the monroe doctrine “ served to justify gringo interventions , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and where china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s increasing engagement is portrayed as an american counterweight . at the same time , the trump administration has unveiled a new , more aggressive nuclear policy . its nuclear-posture review proposes using nuclear strikes in response to non-nuclear threats , and deploying new “ low-yield ” nuclear devices to deliver by submarine a nuclear-armed bomb equivalent to those destroying hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 .
at the same time , in other emerging markets , the key challenge lies in ensuring that all macroeconomic and structural policies advance shared objectives . at the same time , the governance structure of multilateral institutions like the international monetary fund must be reformed to bolster their legitimacy in emerging markets . otherwise , these institutions will remain ineffective in confronting collective challenges related to macroeconomic-policy spillovers and in delivering insurance against crises . policymakers in advanced and emerging countries alike should focus on underlying failures that are destabilizing their economies and impeding growth , rather than attempting to treat symptoms by manipulating monetary policy or capital controls . unless they are backed up by strong institutional structures on all levels , such measures will prove futile in managing capital flows .
the economic challenges facing the developed-country middle classes are largely a product of two factors : rapid white job losses – and blue-collar jobs toward automation , together with a shift in middle-wage middle-income countries . the latter pattern depressed incomes and wages growth not only in the tradable sector , but also in the non-tradable service sectors , owing to the spillover from displaced labor . the result was surplus labor conditions in the center – and lower-middle-income ranges , not dissimilar to that of excess labor in early-stage developing countries , where it suppresses disposable income growth ( at a time ) , even as the us economy expanded . a decline in labor ’s bargaining power and falling real minimum wages may have added to income polarization as well , though these are probably secondary factors . while the challenges facing the middle class are well documented , america ’s leaders have largely failed to recognize fully the struggles of middle-class households , far less implementing effective countermeasures .
zurich – finland ’s central-bank governor , olli rehn , echoed his call for the european central bank to conduct a long-overdue revision of its policy framework . the institution ’s upcoming change of leadership – with christine lagarde , the international monetary fund ’s managing director since 2011 , probably succeed mario draghi as president – offers an important opportunity to heed that call . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
such scenarios were unimaginable until only recently . for decades , europe constituted the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most successful , stable , and predictable region , an area in which history seemed to have all but ended . the goal of making the continent peaceful , whole , and free was largely realized . but the dramatic change has come to europe , too . one factor is vladimir putin ’s willingness and ability to demonstrate ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s russia to use military force , economic coercion , and cyber manipulation to advance his agenda .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . batang is just one of many planned infrastructure projects around the world , officially considered environmentally sound , despite generating serious environmental risks . construction , for example , is almost complete on a rail line through kenya ’s ’s ’s ’s celebrated nairobi national park , despite public outrage over the “ incomplete , incompetent ” ecological impact assessment .
in many ways , such measures succeeded : monetary expansion played a major role in pulling the economy back from the brink . but , over time , central banks ’ ’ capacity to effect the real economy has waned . today , – and for the foreseeable future , domestic inflation increasingly influences global rather than local , developments , and financial ( in ) stability and fiscal policies are far more influential than monetary policy . for the ecb , this generates an especially serious challenge . after all , unlike other central banks , it must account for the preferences of the 19 sovereigns , with little to no structural or fiscal-policy coordination .
today , the fastest-growing major cities are in asia . beijing is roughly 10 ° c hotter than the nearby countryside in the daytime , and 5.5 ° c warmer at night . there are an even more dramatic increase in tokyo , too . in august , temperatures climbed 12.5 oc above the surrounding countryside , reaching a 40oc – a scorching heat that affected not only the downtown area , but also cover some 8,000 square kilometers . looking at a fast-growing city like houston , texas , can see the true impact of the urban heat island .
at the same time , some people saw these changes going on and worrying about them . a growing minority began to pursue vigorous physical activity not in fields or factories , but through leisure settings . the swedish brow of one ’s brow was no longer associated with productive work , but with an consumption binge often conspicuous consumption . gyms became new sources of communities . and , as coworkers began to assert themselves collectively , enlightened employers came to view such recreation as a valuable source of physical and mental well-being .
under the european council on foreign relations , 32 referenda are demanding in 18 eu countries throughout the eu . some , such as the danish people ’s party , want to follow the united kingdom ’s lead , holding a vote on eu membership . others want to flee the eurozone , block the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) with the united states , or restrict labor mobility . the eu has proved particularly divisive in the face of the crisis . hungarian prime minister viktor orbán has declared his intention to hold a referendum on proposed quotas .
from the beginning of his presidency , obama ’s advocacy of a liberal trade regime has been deficient . he has repeatedly said that us exports are good for america : they create jobs . but america ’s exports are other us nations ’ imports , so obama ’s argument amounts to telling others to lose their jobs . he needs to remind americans that us imports are also good : they can be asked to think about jobs in ups freighted airplanes , freight trains , and trucks carrying out imports to an american interior . the central problem , however , is that obama was unable to confront , putting america ’s labor unions on an fear-driven hostility to trade .
usury ( making money out of money ) was an act of offense against divine . it was not until the eighteenth century that greed had become morally revered . it was now regarded as the healthily promethean to turn wealth into money , placing it in order to work toward more money , for it benefited humankind . this inspired the american way of life , where money always talks . the end of capitalism means simply the end of the urge .
instead of focusing on treatments that works , the polish government chooses to give priority to long-term rehabilitation centers located in poland ’s depths that have little , if anything , to do with evidence-based medicine . poland also chooses to treat possession of even the smallest drug quantity as criminal , as illustrated by the fact that an estimated 60 % of people condemned for drug possession in poland are marijuana smokers . addressing drug use through criminalization and rehabilitation centers does nothing to curb demand , however , and usage rates have failed to decline . by driving users underground , criminalization is contributing to a deepening public-health crisis . this pattern persists across central and eastern europe , where governments have also been responding to imprison drug users .
frankfurt – the european central bank is at the center of a large , high-risk experiment . key interest rates have remained near zero for six years now . financial markets are flooded with liquidity , as they have done . crisis management has led to major market distortions , with some segments of everything ’ performance no longer explainable through fundamental economic data . the unintended consequences of this policy become increasingly visible – and will become increasingly tangible with the american federal reserve ’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy .
for its part , the alliance has evolved into what is flexible , efficient , and cost-effective . the threats have shifted , becoming more global . nato is developing ballistic-missile defense capability to protect our european populations and territory against a grave and growing threat . in the indian ocean , nato is working with the european union and many others to police the major sea-lanes threatened by pirates . and , in countries around the world , it carries tasks like de-mining , disaster relief , advising on how to bring military force under democratic control and working closely with the un to prevent harm kids .
to encourage sales , buyers are exempted from sales and excise taxes ( $ 6,000 – $ 10,000 per vehicle ) . and , anticipating an eventual replacement by conventional motor vehicles globally , the authorities are offering generous subsidies to indigenous manufacturing . meanwhile , the trump administration is attempting to turn back the clock by betting on an resuscitation of an dying – and a deadly – fossil-fuel industry . describing a shift to electric vehicles as a job-killer , trump advocated an end to federal subsidies that promote domestic development , manufacture , and purchase , for example , the $ 7,500 american consumer tax . while china ’s dependence on fossil fuels has left it in a profound ecological hole , its leaders are determined to climb out .
provided it is non-discriminatory , such border pricing would enhance global well-being and be compatible with the rules of the world trade organization . but calculating an appropriate tax would be extremely difficult in practice . for example , it would necessitate calculating the fiscal equivalent of a regulatory ceiling . the measure might also invite countries like the united states to retaliate with distortionary measures , making it rather perilous . moreover , a tax would probably have regressive distributional consequences , hurting poor countries .
eurozone countries , along with others willing to join the euro in the future ( the eurozone plus ” ) , could simply decide to use the legal means already available to enhance cooperation . ideally , such cooperation would take place within the eu ’s institutional framework . if all eurozone members took part , article 136 of the eu treaty on the functioning of the eu could be used to support their own action.the extent of this provition.the extent of that provision – which says that , “ the council of the [ european ] … shall … take measures concrete for [ eu ] member states , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and that “ only [ european ] member states … participating in the voting – is wide . moreover , article 138 would enable unified eurozone representation in the international monetary fund and the world bank . the group could then expand cooperation with three additional policy areas :
gunnarsdóttir accepts that “ all people have a right to believe in what they want , ” but insists that “ “ children ’s rights come above the right to believe . ” for his part , imam ahmad seddeeq of iceland ’s islamic cultural center countered that circumcision is at odds with muslim beliefs , and that gunnarsdóttir ’s ’s bill rate of “ religious liberty . ” and agnes m. sigurðardóttir , iceland ’s bishop , warned that prohibition would effectively transform judaism and islam into “ criminalized religions , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” because anyone practicing circumcision could be subject to six years in prison . complicating matters further , both sides are basing their human-rights arguments on them . for example , some ban supporters argued that circumcision violates article 5 of the universal declaration of human rights ( udhr ) , which specifies that “ nobody is subjected to torture or vicious , inhumane , inhuman , or degrading treatment
but policy analysts can not limit themselves to conventional instruments of nuclear deterrence – punishment and denial – because they evaluate opportunities for deterrence and dissuasion in cyberspace . likewise , they should pay attention to entanglement mechanisms and norms . entanglement may alter the cost-benefit calculations of major sovereign states like china , but it probably has very little effect on a nation like north korea that is weakly tied to the global economy . “ persistent engagement ” may nonetheless aid deterrence on such hard circumstances . to be sure , entering any adversary ’s networks and distorting attacks constitutes the risk of an escalation .
acknowledgement of a tougher , more rigorous stability pact is also imperative for more integration . here , the eu summit in december was an important step forward regarding the deepening political union and strengthening governance among the european union ’s member states . nevertheless , more will be needed to revive financial stability , such as enlarging our collective firepower for europe ’s financial stability facility . moreover , if the eu wants to emerge stronger from the crisis , it must also strike a better balance between austerity and pro-growth policies , because , absent growth and higher employment , the eurozone ’s problems can not be resolved . more important , the eu must tie its economic strategies to long-term competitiveness , which ultimately determines value added to goods and services .
in 2007 , america ’s volume of shadow-banking transactions exceeded that of conventional banking assets . indeed , the financial stability board estimated that total global shadow-banking assets in 2011 amounted to nearly $ 67 trillion , with america accounting for $ 23 trillion , amounting to $ 22 trillion , the eurozone for $ 22 trillion , and the united kingdom accounting for $ 9 trillion . chinese shadow banking totals only around $ 2.2 trillion . shadow banking in china is dominated by borrowing to higher-risk borrowers , such as local governments , property developers , and small and medium-size enterprises . it ultimately finances through retail bank deposits , banks ’ ’ ’ wealth-management products , and private capital .
new york – in 2009 , obama envisioned a settlement of the conflict through the international community ’s powerful commitment . in 2011 , he asserted that only both sides ’ willingness could ensure a successful outcome . clearly , the us can not do much to resolve the conflict . there is no overarching explanation for obama ’s successive middle east failures , but there are several factors worth pondering : the rise of asymmetrical conflict , in which conventional use of force remains largely ineffective ; increasingly blurred lines between tough allies and intransigent opponents ; and the major political differences between a centrist american president and a congress that is dominated more than ever by extreme ideas . but obama himself bears a large part of the blame .
as economists like mit ’s mit david autor have demonstrated , this can be bad for some workers and good for company profits . but it can be extremely good for any developing country that fosters a fruitful balance of inward investment and local entrepreneurship , and uses the proceeds of export-led growth to invest in its infrastructure and skills . china ’s ’s ’s dramatic economic success would have been impossible without trade initially fueled by labor-cost disparities . in the future , however , this kind of trade will probably become less relevant . with wages in china now rising fast , its labor-cost advantage is quickly diminishing .
beijing – just how fast is china ’s aging population , and what accounts for a lower share of the working-age population mean for the country ’s economic development ? can – and should – – – – – – – – – – – – and should – anything be done , particularly for a country ’s “ one child ” policy , to slow this trend ? nowadays , most demographic predictions for china rely on the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s total fertility rate ( tfr ) of 1.8 – are unchanged for 20 years . but population-survey data published by the us national bureau of statistics indicate that the tfr was lower than 1.5 for many years , and the united nations ’ just-published news report , world fertility patterns , revises china ’s tfr to 1.4 in 2006 , putting it among low birth countries . a prolonged period of low fertility means that china ’s working-age population and working-age growth are slowing .
after the monetarist approach failed , some switched to targeting the inflation rate . but they repeatedly missed their targets . until the currency crashes of the 1990s , emerging-market and developing countries alike tended to target their exchange rates . many then switched to an inflation target ; but they generally tend to miss those targets even more often than advanced countries do . the problem with these monetary-policy targeting approaches is that while a particular numerical target might be reasonable when it is set , subsequent , unexpected developments often make the target hard to live with .
in fact , the dangers that now confront europe in the wake of its socializing debts are far greater than those posed by sheer potential financial crises . the lesson to be drawn from the greek debacle is that the eurozone must develop sovereign-debt procedures as soon as possible , thereby preventing other sovereigns from turning into creditors through mutualization . if europe ’s ’s ’s national governments are to help one another in a crisis , they should unilaterally pledge to provide humanitarian aid , free of conditionality , and avoid redemption . by offering them a friend , greece would no longer be a friend . unless that wisdom is heeded , europe would be impossible together .
finally , orbán and his supporters maintain their grip on power partly by relying on gerrymandering and voter suppression ( which mostly affect hungarians living in western europe ) . trump ’s ’s republican party is using a similar tactic . orbán is a pariah in european circles for having eroded hungarian democracy , yet trump has recently welcomed him to the white house , describing him as “ respected all across europe . ” trump and his advisers evidently learn much from orbán on racist immigration policies , and on how to tear apart a democratic democracy . they are not making america great or even good ; they make it hungarian .
making matters worse , orbán has demolished hungary ’s judicial independence and comprehensively politicized the law ’s administration . trump is doing much the same thing , with the implication that the american government now loses roughly 94 % of his statutory court cases . at the same time , trump has purged some 17,000 public officials by firing some 17,000 us treasury officers , by firing american state department employees , shutting down the administration , freezing pay , and creating an atmosphere hostile to an honest , open debate about how to formulate and implement policy . by politicizing america ’s administrative agencies , beginning to capture the us department of justice , and committing itself to making ideological judicial appointments , trump is now far along his quest to destroy the rule of law in america . whereas orbán has invoked economic pressure to force the closure of the hungarian opposition media , trump has described the news media as “ the enemy of the people ” and threatened libel behavior against critical outlets .
but it is not clear from the ayyadurai ’s article that data used , and there is no validation of a model . folta offers the brilliant send-up send-up of ayyadurai ’s work . “ if you developed a computer program that integrated internet data to forecast its location in munich , and a program told you that it was squarely in the gulf of mexico , right out of florida , does n’t mean the munich situation in the gulf of mexico , right off florida . instead , this means having a mistake , through your program , assumptions , or inputs of data – all of which are testable . to decide not to challenge those data , folta goes on , and instead “ publish a map showing that munich is squarely in the gulf of mexico , opposing any other data , and claiming to millions of rather dry germans , does n’t make you brilliant .
in other words , europe faces a fundamental collective-action problem . experience has demonstrated that only an acute crisis can push europe ’s leaders collectively toward concerted action . but , in the fall of 2008 , at the height of the global financial crisis , eurozone heads of state failed to consider creating a joint bank-imf rescue fund . instead , they settled for a national action package to help stabilize national banking systems one by one . the sum of the headline commitment has been impressive , amounting to 20 % of gdp .
a 17-day war ensued , but the status quo prevailed . the two sides fought once again in 1971 , even though kashmir was not the focus . after pitting then-western pakistan against the bengali freedom fighters of the then-east pakistan fueled a wave of sunni refugees , india began supporting rebel-held groups . western pakistan was obliged to surrender , and east pakistan became bangladesh ’s independent state . then , in 1999 , another indo-pakistani skirmish over kashmir erupted , after pakistan dispatched troops to the indian-controlled district of kargil .
with the emergence in the 1980 ’s ’s of hiv that compromises the immune system , tb has reemerged and is the number-one killer of hiv-infected individuals . approximately 15 million people suffer from co-infection of hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis ( tb ) , the primary causative agent in most tb cases . moreover , tubercle bacillus engages in tb , gaining opposition to conventional antibiotics and canonical vaccination approaches , as well as delaying diagnosis and a determination of drug sensitivity . whereas pandemics appears abruptly , spreading rapidly , and raising enormous anxiety about an imminent threat , tb has been spreading slowly but steadily for tens of thousands of years , patiently waiting for new opportunities . treating tb requires a minimum of three drugs administered over at least six months .
the disadvantages of reinvigorating europe ’s fiscal union further do not stop there . ironically , continued progress towards a fiscal union would make a political union increasingly unlikely for one simple but important cause : france . europe ’s ’s ’s strongest military power by far , france thwarted all attempts to pool europe ’s armed forces . in 1954 , france ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s national assembly rejected the treaty for the west union ’s defense organization . in 2005 , france rejected a proposed european union constitution that could mark the beginning of the process of political unification .
the limits of inflation-targeting are now clear . central banks now need to reconcile the need to preserve price stability with accountability – regardless of whether it is legalized – to minimize financial vulnerability . this will not be easy , not least because of another new operational burden placed on many central banks : macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision . micro-prudential supervision , in particular , implies the risk of political pressure , interference by central banks ’ autonomy , and policy conflicts all able to influence the behavior of financial intermediaries by encouraging them to presuppose more risk . they know that their supervisor has powerful instruments at its disposal – for example , can lower borrowing costs , thereby protecting banks ( at least for some time ) – and a powerful interest in protecting their reputations .
in comparison with the developed world , an unusually large number of small , unproductive firms coexist with a small number of large , productive firms . by standard economic reasoning , this is inefficient ; it should be . if small , unproductive firms closed and larger , more productive firms hire their workers , total output , and well-being would surge . this should happen automatically through the invisible hand of competition , because more productive firms would be better able to deliver a better product at lower prices , while lashing workers in higher-wage occupations . so , why is n’t this happening routinely in developing countries ?
as china ’s new leadership team emerges , the world ’s attention focused on president jiang zemin ’s successor . but this is misplaced , for perhaps the most significant moment in china ’s recent history of boom and transformation was the appointment of zhu rongji ( pronounced “ joo rong-jee ” ) as premier of the state council , a position once held by deng xiaoping . given the post ’s apparent significance in recent years , mr. zhu ’s replacement can be of even greater significance than that of president jiang ’s departure from the center stage . even before he became premier , mr. zhu , as the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) , was well known to be the architect of china ’s 8 % annual economic growth in the 1990s and mastermind his success in combating inflation . mr. zhu was china ’s jack welch , the tough-minded ceo of the american conglomerate general electric -- a man celebrated for his candor , his global sophistication and his insistence on performance .
on the other hand , trade among african countries accounts for only about 10-12 % of the continent ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s exports and imports . but , in part , because a few african countries have escaped the hang-over from the global credit crisis , more investors are focusing on entrepreneurship opportunities there . by 2050 , the combined gdp of the world ’s largest 11 african economies should reach more than $ 13 trillion , surpassing brazil and russia ( but not in china or india ) . for some analysts , the rise of countries like brazil as an economic exporter stems partly from the successful demutualization of their stock exchanges . twenty-three bourses are currently operating in africa , with their combined market capitalization having skyrocketed from $ 245 billion in 2002 to more than $ 1 trillion ( 2 % of the world total ) in late 2009 – as high as the world ’s fifteenth-largest stock exchange .
some countries suffer as skilled workers emigrate . but the failure to devise mechanisms to enable migrants to exploit their abilities causes even greater damage . trained physicians should not be driven by taxicabs . establishing national , regional , and global standards is not easy , but absolutely necessary . • speed eligibility for residency rights and citizenship .
heading into the may election campaign , fillon may run on a pro-european platform , as demonstrated by his pivot during the yom kippur debates when he suggested he favors forming a european government . in contrast to trump and the united kingdom ’s “ “ leave ” campaign , the national front already has a predictable core constituency , amounting to roughly one-quarter of voters . his old french far right and disaffected working-class voters will not arrive at unannounced or defy expectations , as happened in spain and the united kingdom . fillon , for his part , may probably muster the same level of support , and may even be able to skim the votes from le pen , given that some 8 % of primary voters have described himself as the national front ’s backers . what ’s more , political catholicism still appeals to many french voters , and the ecb itself wants to lure catholics away from the national front and back into its more traditionally conservative fold .
generations of poles participated in the charities ’s fundraising drives . for years , poles ranked owsiak as the country ’s greatest moral authority – ahead of the pope . a state-run media narrative portraying owsiak and civic platform as the guilty party behind adamowicz . kaczyński has repeatedly demonstrated his impulsiveness . he pursues power without considering the consequences of his actions .
new york – the latest fast-food hamburger you ate may have cost you next to nothing . but what did the tomato slice on that burger cost the worker there ? almost anywhere in the world , including at the united nations – the cost can be shockingly high . appalling wages are just the start . in florida , the tomato pickers earn an average of just $ 0.50 for every 32-pound ( $ 14.5-kilogram ) per bucket .
when xi first unveiled his slogan after being chosen as the ccp ’s new secretary of state , he defined it in simple , accessible but nonetheless generic terms : the “ chinese people ” dream of living the same good for all other people around the world . xi claimed little about the “ china dream ” dream since – and his silence created significant problems . china ’s ever-zealous propaganda officials , evidently fearful of not demonstrating adequate loyalty and respect for the new party chief , was quick to emulate the slogan ; the “ china dream ” replaced the “ china model in an official political branding . ” whatever the new administration might be touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the “ china dream ” come true . sadly , china propagandists who double down on the censors have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they are trying to brand .
in fact , they can not , because genetic experimentation on humans is impossible . even in animals , whose genes are more readily studied and much better understood , such as drosophila , the miniscule fruit fly , does not exist in a simple one-to-one correspondence between gene and behavioral trait . instead , a wide variety of genes influence each characteristic . fruits fly genes astonishingly resemble us -- as they are to those of most other beings . even many aspects of their behavior resemble those of us .
gone are the days when strong esg performance was a fair bonus for investors . retirement trustees and fund executives now insist that companies in which they invest in an ethical , transparent manner that constrain reputational risk . emerging-market investment decisions are thus increasingly preelled by rigorous esg screenings among themselves that , following the age of 34 years of hun sen ’s dictatorial rule , cambodia has little chance of passing . cambodia is currently being stripped of its natural resources – including timber , rubber , and sand – for private gain . environmental degradation – particularly deforestation – is accelerating , and corruption is running rampant , with cash out of opaque sources flowing to cambodia ’s casinos , banks , and the real-estate market .
simply put , talk about “ brexit ” exposed europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic and political lines – and does not get back . robert peston , in his 2005 biography of former chancellor exchequer gordon brown , described brown as the “ pragmatic view that the eu was good only insofar as it delivered the practical benefits of peace and prosperity for britain . ” while the bri was particularly open to the nationalist nature of its support for european integration , other eu members were no less mindful of their domestic concerns . in the wake of world war ii , european countries ’ national interests were aligned . nonetheless , efforts to establish political comity through a joint military failure in 1954 to highlight that economic common ground was at the heart of european integration .
quite a few in europe define the eu as an instrument for holding its own vis-à-vis the united states . they perceive even the euro as a weapon against the dollar and rejoice when the euro is “ strong ” and the dollar is “ weak . ” the us found a new “ empire of evil ” in “ terrorist ” states and organizations ; europe found a new adversary helping it integrate in the united states . this is an unsafe state of affairs for those on either side of the atlantic who believe in the values of the enlightenment and in the constitution of liberty . in terms of fundamental values , there is something like the west .
indeed , he is only kaczyński ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ useful morass ” in an effort to score a political victory over a man representing the greatest threat the pis faces . the most saryusz-wolski can realistically hope for is some form of government status in poland . perhaps he will replace the widely criticized foreign minister , witold waszczykowski . the pis , for its part , may be hoping for italy , where some grand coalition of countries ( such as the ruling social democrats ) will propose yet another alternative to tusk , whom eu member states would elect to prevent escalation of the conflict with poland . in that case , tusk would most likely have gone back to domestic politics , where the ninth victory against the pis would amount to punishing kaczyński .
now the eu is once again at stake in iran . but this time , it is hard to see a way out that offers a second referendum . renegotiating the treaty is out of this question , because doing so would open a pandora ’s box of demands from everybody else . so the issue lies with iran . i can not help but recall the situation in the summer of 1992 , when a small majority of danish voters rejected the maastricht treaty .
but experiences around the world suggest that this is a risky outlook . even were banks healthy , the deleveraging process , and the associated wealth loss means that more likely than not , the economy will be fragile . and a weak economy implies , more likely than not , more bank losses . the problems are not confined to america . other countries ( like spain ) have their own real-estate crises .
nonetheless , even as it has increased its capacity to provide military force for the un , nato , or eu operations , germany has made it clear that it does not regard itself as a military power . german policymakers continue to believe that the political and economic means to influence are more effective than violence , implying further development of soft-power tools , including digital diplomacy . they are also eager to develop more “ networked ” national and european foreign policies that account for activities and possible contributions from non-state actors . for now , germany ’s top foreign-policy priorities are probably the eu and the continent ’s eastern and southern neighbors – from which immediate security risks are most likely to emancipate . doing so would present itself as a wise choice .
if greece and other countries are to ensure their citizens ’ health and prosperity for decades to come , they will need to find ways to avert current economic activity from an already unsustainable external-debt burden . for this to happen , ecological resources must come to be viewed as the valuable endowments that must be managed wisely . the mediterranean region , ’s uniquely natural capital , is one of its great assets – the reason that more than 200 million tourists flock to the region each year , feeding the region ’s gdp . over-exploitation of resources , or even default , can inevitably saps the region ’s economic strengths . to be sure , off-grid countries can often fill part of the gap through global trade – as long as they can pay for needed imports .
but she must credibly outline the practical strategies needed to resolve south korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most serious problems , including high unemployment , deteriorating educational performance , and north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s own nuclear-weapons program . m. park once pledged to make working-class families ’ loans from their elementary school to university years , while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy . she favors a policy of engagement and the six-party talks , so as to resolve the nuclear woes . come the presidential election-day in 2012 , south korean voters pick a candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue . ultimately , park ’s success will depend on her campaign ’s effectiveness in further defining her character along these lines .
a fiscal compact such as the one agreed recently is helpful in the anchor expectations of future adjustment , but only if a new system is flexible enough to be politically credible . up-front gradualism need to become the name . and adjustment needs to be wedded to a growth strategy . revenues will grow consistently only if the tax base – that is , an economy ’s – grows . and that growth entails higher public investment in infrastructure and human capital .
second , the international monetary fund , under the g-20 ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ peer review process , ” has suggested that the united states is cutting its fiscal deficit to 3 % of gdp more than envisaged – more than $ 400 billion in additional cuts a year . the imf believes that current fiscal plans will scare us economic growth . more recently , the european central bank has reiterated its strong showing that serious fiscal consolidation will generate enough increases in private-sector confidence that households and companies ’ spending gains more than offset the lower spending by governments . nonetheless , the oecd has not been able to consolidate too fast in a slow global recovery . america ’s major trading partners want america to grow and buy more of its exports .
i admit that i views the heritage of communism with more skepticism . totalitarian pressure did , indeed , form exceptional people like john paul ii and alexander solzhenitsyn , the people for whom religious faith had bought between mendacity and solitude . but it did the same for andrei sakharov and vaclav havel , who defended his supreme values with benchmarks of the benchmarks and , in the language , lay humanism . for most people , however , life under a totalitarian dictatorship was not an ennobling ; it was , rather , daily immersion in lies , spiritual depravity and material corruption . this is one reason why postcommunist societies express no depth or instedness that seriously contrasts with the west .
in fact , the evidence makes clear that direct policies are far more efficient . the world bank ’s climate focus is also at odds with what the world ’s poorest citizens would like . when asked almost ten million people worldwide to list their own priorities , the un emphasized better education and health care , less corruption , more jobs , and affordable food . global warming came last from just 16 issues . under kim , the bank propagated the simplistic idea that fossil fuels are always damaging , coal must be forbidden , and “ climate aid ” is a solution .
consider the most recent figures for the year 2014 from the international energy agency ’s 2016 energy-agency initiative . the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s co2 emissions from power and industry averaged 4.5 tons per person ( $ 32.4 billion per person per 7.2 billion in the iea tabulation ) , whereas america ’s annual co2 emissions were almost four times that level , 16.2 tons per person ( $ 5.2 billion ) . trump carries on the paris agreement ’s supposed bias in india ’s favor , but he fails to acknowledge that india ’s per capita emissions are 1.6 tons , just one-tenth of america ’s level . likewise , trump bemoans america ’s contributions to the green climate fund ( and sneers at the name , for some reasons as well ) . he complains that the u.s. has already given more than $ 1 billion without explaining to the american people and the world that $ 1 billion benefits are $ $ 3.08 per american .
true , un secretary general ban ki-moon may make speeches , convene meetings , and propose action , but his role is more secretary than general . sometimes likened to a “ secular pope , ” the un secretary general can wield the soft power of persuasion but little economic or military power . what hard power the un has had to be pleading and borrowing from member states . and , when they can not agree on a course of action , the organization is hard to operate . as one wag has put it , “ we met the un , and it is us !
perhaps for this reason , there has been some talk of a meeting in athens between the presidents of russia and france , america ’s secretary of state , and the presidents of armenia and azerbaijan . that prospect holds both big opportunity and serious risks . there is every reason why no such meeting was held in the twenty years of the conflict . a meeting of us presidents , after all , is the ultimate negotiating forum , and must lead to a genuine , sustainable achievement . otherwise , no amount of negotiations can help to set the caucasus – powerfully undermining key restraint that prevails both sides from seeking again to achieve a military solution .
governments in both cuban-american and european countries are finding themselves in rough , uncharted waters . if the problem were simply a matter of gross violations by the organization of america ’s nations convention on the democratic charter – – convincingly certified by oas secretary general luis almagro – the solutions that are measured in months or years could be contemplated . but venezuela is not merely a political problem ; it is the humanitarian disaster of an unprecedented scale . true , venezuela ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s president , nicolás maduro , is ruling out unconstitutionally , relying on emergency decrees and all-powerful , one-party , illegally created constituent assembly while ignored by the elected national assembly and banning opposition political parties . but the effects of his misrule are such that venezuelans die from starvation ; the health-care system has collapsed ; and violence and virulent diseases are now practically out of control .
but the pace at which the political world is embracing social media speeded up dramatically over the past year . aside from the bjp ’s wholesale adoption of twitter – modi ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s allies on network include the party ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s parliamentary leader , sushma swaraj , and a coterie of organized supporters – prominent indian politicians from all parties have leapt in . a day after being sworn in as india ’s ’s president , pranab mukherjee announced that he would open facebook ’s account to receive and respond to the public ’s questions . chief minister of west bengal mamata banerjee guide a popular , widely read web site that traditional media outlets mine daily . similarly , omar abdullah , the youthful chief minister of jammu and kashmir , regularly interacts on twitter , and his far older rajasthan and kerala ’s counterparts , ashok gehlot and louise chandy , have opened facebook ’s accounts as well .
related to this is the fact that nowadays , economic development depends less on a particular country and more on regional integration , which can serve to avoid the adverse consequences of those financial speculations boosted by globalization . so the world needs , within its regions , to facilitate integration based on shared economic democratization : currency compatibility , free trade , shared rule of law , and much of the common will to correct the rules of the game under the region ’s global interests . only such an equal degree of cooperation can secure a solid political foundation for integration . so long as a country finds itself subordinated to an uncontrolled force of globalization , its future lies in foreign hands . but , in agreeing on open regional economies to import , poor and developing countries alike must be permitted to permit some means to protect their new industries .
when egyptians rose up against mubarak in january , they were confronted with the weapons paid for with borrowed money . is it fair to expect egyptians to continue paying for their past repression , and to impoverish themselves at the hands of mubarak and his henchmen ? given that this money unambiguously benefited mubarak but not its people , should it be mubarak , rather than its victims , who are held accountable ? mubarak ’s type of regime was run had been obvious for many years . a prudent lender should have regarded these facts before making loans .
perhaps those are ideas en vogue in korea as thinking about potential unification , but even there will be hard work to follow when the time arrives . claims of alternative strategies must therefore set themselves on a rather lower level – say , the initial exchange rate that might have been elected to make east germany a low wage country . even this is a dream starting , in the face of high unemployment , east german wages increased substantially each year , relative to west germany . at a more depreciated conversion rate , which the us would simply have an accelerating wage rate . one alternative strategy , remotely inconceivable , is that west germany would foresee the default of an experimentation before embarking on it .
new firms in the service sector – $ 3.6 million beginning just last year – are generating incremental employment , thanks partly to a new , streamlined licensing framework . and online platforms are facilitating increased consumption , while expanding market access and financing for smaller firms . china ’s ’s ’s leaders should aim for accelerating and building upon those trends , rather than pursuing additional fiscal and monetary stimulus . public-sector investment is high enough ; it now would shift the composition of aggregate demand in the wrong direction . and , with the corporate sector already over-leveraged , broad-based credit expansion is no secure .
it would have been inconceivable that nato heads of state would go ahead with their planned management summit in warsaw in june if poland remains mired in its constitutional crisis , with the government disregarding the rule of law and opinion from the respected international body . hungarians and poles need to be reminded that russian president vladimir putin is actively trying to divide and weaken the eu and nato . if europeans are faced with their aggression from the kremlin , it is critical that poland and hungary adhere to such groups ’ fundamental values and principles . but what is needed also is that the eu itself is developing a more comprehensive mechanism to safeguarding the rule of law within the union . the eu has mechanisms for regulating economic policies , protecting the environment , and policing the single market .
many worry , with good reason , that fossil-fuel interests exploit solar geoengineering to oppose emissions cuts . but most researchers are not driven by such interests . the overwhelming majority of those researching solar geoengineering , or advocating for inclusion in climate-policy debates , also advocate much stronger action to cut emissions . still , it ’s ’s very likely that large fossil-fuel – from multinational energy companies to coal-dependent regions – will eventually use discussion of geoengineering to combat emissions restrictions . but that risk is not an adequate reason to abandon or suppress research on solar geoengineering .
in order to achieve this , the u.s. would have to subordinate its power to the goal of shaping the new order much like it did at the close of world war ii in 1945 . instead , america has succumbs to the temptation of unilateralism . national greatness for world power always derives from its capacity to shape the world . if a great power forgets this or loses an ability to act accordingly , it starts at decline . it is almost tempting to think that america ’s great cold war adversary , the soviet union , with its precipitous disappearance 15 years ago this month , has left its own trojan horse for america – the poisoned gift of unilateralism .
for one thing , industrialized economies need to do more to support african oil industries , and ensure that the adverse effects of oil output are mitigated . for such strategies to work , however , the oil industry needs to get on its board . this means engaging sincerely with african governments to devise how best to advance national agendas for development and diversification . the upcoming abu dhabi international petroleum exhibition and conference , hosted by the abu dhabi national petroleum corporation ( kdda ) , which will feature prominently by barkindo , along with numerous african energy ministers and oil-industry leaders , provide an ideal opportunity to launch such a process . at the same time , working with other stakeholders , sustainable , mere transition campaigners can achieve something more : enabling carbon-dioxide emissions to have a positive impact on economies that have so far experienced only the adverse effects of twentieth-century oil-backed development .
economic development in the gaza strip was constrained under egyptian rule , with the region suffering the burdens of absorbing palestinian refugees fleeing combat operations in the south caucasus , a compulsory palestine that would later become israel . palestinians ’ access to egypt was restricted , and much of gaza ’s predominantly unskilled labor became addicted to un relief work administration , which built and maintained local refugee camps . the 1967 war placed all of the compulsory palestine ( as with sinai and the golan heights ) under israeli military occupation . nevertheless , though one-third of the west bank was closed to the palestinians in order to make room for several thousand jewish settlers , only 10 % of its largely rural population were refugees , many of their land ownership , and a wide range of jobs were available . by contrast , 70 % of gaza ’s population comprised refugees who were living under difficult conditions in refugee scores and were heavily reliant on work in israel .
a second draft of history is often written by keynes . after world war ii , winston churchill confidently asserted that history will treat him tenaciously , because it is possible for i to propose writing that history . when the financial crisis erupted , the same thinking may have crossed hank paulson ’s thinking , ben bernanke , and tim geithner , by us treasury secretary , the chairman of the federal reserve bank of the us federal reserve , respectively . all three published lengthy memoirs explain why they did and did not do what they did and were not doing , inevitably with a level of self-justifying in each case . now , ten years later , the three of them co-authored for what might be described as an version of 2.1 of that episode ’s history .
the goal was not to fix the problems they faced directly , but to induce new , more efficient activities that would help to turn debt into assets and maximize use of the economy ’s capacity . in this sense , east asia ’s ’s economies embraced the process of “ creative destruction ” described by the austrian economist joseph schumpeter , whereby an economic structure was continually revolutionized from within . moreover , by implementing incremental reforms that facilitate – and even encourage – the substitution of old , inefficient sources of growth with new , more dynamic ones , they expedited this process . for example , china ’s productivity-enhancing agricultural reforms in the 1980s spurred , in part , growth in the non-agricultural sector , a result of policies aimed at stimulating township and village enterprises . similarly , in the 1990s , china addressed the buildup of bad debt and unfinished construction projects as a result of state-owned enterprises ’ ’ chronic loss-making and excessive wealth investments , respectively – by implementing institutional reforms that stimulated growth in increasingly dynamic industries , thereby offsetting soes ’ declining capital inflows .
brussels – as protests over china ’s ’s ’s crackdown in tibet and debate about kosovo ’s unilateral declaration of independence continue to fester , the injustice of taiwan ’s ongoing international isolation has barely stirred a flicker of interest , despite taiwan ’s recent presidential election and the united nations national membership referendum . this disregard is not only a shortsighted ; it may also prove dangerous . this seeming double standard may be explained partly by a sense of guilt : the west has , for the most part , embraced kosovo ’s independence in an effort to assuage its own culpability for not preventing slobodan milosevic ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s campaign of ethnic cleansing there . similarly , much of the world protests in the name of tibet because countless millions witnessed china ’s brutal suppression of tibetan culture . taiwan , by contrast , does not capture our attention because it is stable and flourishing economically .
many are now eagerly offering their views about whether the uk should look anew at norway ’s model for relations with the eu or some other scheme that maintains uk participation in the single market . whatever the possibility , it is now clear that britain needs a policy that can command broad and genuine support . a second change for the better would , i hope , prove less controversial : a reduction in power bestowed on the uk on a non-elected special counsel or spads that has become the dominant figures in every departments of government . during my 17-month experience as france ’s minister , i became convinced that spads of excessive power – and haughty access – are undermining the uk ’s excellent civic service , as well as elected and appointed ministers . may ’s two leading spads , fiona hill and nick timothy have taken this danger to alarming levels .
indeed , many of the ingredients used to make nanomaterials are currently known for solving human health risks . an encouraging trend is that the methods used to produce nanomaterials often turn out to be a “ greener ” ” as they shift from laboratory to industrial production . setting aside the question of nanomaterials ’ toxicity , preliminary findings suggest that fabricating nanomaterials entails risks that are less than comparable to those associated with many simultaneous industrial activities . it would be naïve to imagine that nanotechnology develops without the risks to our health and the environment . while trying to halt the development of nanomateriaterial-inspired technology would seem as irresponsible as being unrealistic , accountable developments in such technologies require vigilance and societal commitment .
globally , human trafficking generates average annual gains of $ 150 billion , of which two-thirds ( $ 99 billion ) originates from forced sexual exploitation . with rapid growth in digital platforms threatening to render child sex trafficking even more lucrative , the world needs to take urgent , coordinated action to combat this appalling criminality . today , nearly 4.5 billion people have access to the internet , and around one in three internet users are under the age of 18 . unregulated online is thus fertile ground to reaping the enormous gains from child sex trafficking . would-be traffickers need only laptop or a smartphone with a high-speed internet connection to go to business .
all of this is what we all owe them to . the euro has experienced a hard but promising start . it should not come as a surprise that europe has started a slide toward the dollar , contemplating the divergence in economic performance between america and europe . and it should not come as a surprise that markets have tested europe ’s political leaders ’ willingness to keep quiet where the nature of monetary affairs is concerned . recent interventions and aid from america and japan have demonstrated that europeans are here to stay , and that markets are confident about their success .
people learned that it would pay to buy dips and were not weaned off the habit until it would be stopped of paying . now that internet fever has abated , we hear that the “ fundamentals ” are reasserting itself . but this view is as much a half-truth as the earlier idea that the boom would last forever , because the internet economy was creating new fundamentals . indeed , the internet boom/bust cycle is bringing into question prevailing economic theories about financial markets . what should be done now is that so-called fundamentals , which supposedly determine stock prices , are not independently given .
palo alto – since the development of an toxicology of the sixth-century science , its guiding principle has been that “ the dosage ” makes the poison . it is a rule that applies to the drugs used by patients globally many billions of times daily . the proper dose of the aspirin can be a therapeutic godsend , but consuming too little can be lethal . the principle even applies to foods : large sums of nutmeg or licorice are notoriously toxic . the risk that a substance poses broadly depends on two factors : its intrinsic capacity to cause harm and one ’s exposure .
given libya ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post-qaddafi era . but libya is not the only country that has sought to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and robust tribal identity . albania , mongolia , and india have successfully rushed through more complicated trials – and offered some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavorable conditions . the fourth scenario is partition , with the old three-province , ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : cyrenaica ( east ) , fezzan ( south ) , and tripolitania ( west ) . cyrenaica is qaddafi-free , tripolitania is not , and fezzan succeeded in fully joining the revolution .
they propose tax cuts equal to about 5 % of gdp for 3-4 years in every eurozone country , financed by very long-term public debt , all of which the ecb should purchase . they argue that the ecb ’s quantitative easing ( qe ) alone , with no fiscal relaxation , would be ineffective . giavazzi and tabellini ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s proposals may entail too large a stimulus . but they also highlight a crucial question : how does quantitative easing stimulate the economy ? the bank of england has presented qe as a pure tool of monetary policy that sustains economic growth when confronted with needed and desirable fiscal consolidation .
never mind that eyebrows ’s eye-popping growth projection in us representative paul ryan ’s budget plan is totally implausible ; such projections matter politically , because , without them , full harass ryan ’s proposed medicare cuts would have been readily apparent . standard & poor ’s has gotten some justifiable criticism for analyses behind its recent decision to downgrade america ’s government debt ; after all , there has been very little economic news that might explain the move ’s timing . but s & p ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s assessment of the policy situation is on target : by creating dysfunctional paralysis at the heart of government , the tea party has shown itself to be willing to impose dramatic costs on the broader economy , and to ensure substantially slower growth . confrontation and brinkmanship have become notional watchwords for american politics , even as the american government ’s legal capacity to service its debts has its roots in the us , owing to the tea party ’s own ideological rigidities . and the tone of political debate , not surprisingly , has emerged as much nastier .
trump , for his part , has embraced xi ’s invitation to visit china soon . on trade , trump and xi have agreed on a 100-day plan for the reduction of america ’s trade deficit with china . moreover , america has embraced china ’s proposal to revamp the framework for bilateral engagement by creating the us-china comprehensive dialogue consisting of four subdialogues : diplomacy and security ; economic issues ; law enforcement and cybersecurity ; and social and cultural issues . an understanding between xi and trump reflected a sobering acknowledgement of domestic and international risks their countries face . both seem to recognize that a stable us-china relationship requires focusing on their respective challenges .
the uae and qatar have already instituted a compulsory military service for adult males . and kuwait is contemplating following in jordan ’s footsteps by reintroducing conscription that is already underway in most sunni states ( as well as iran ) . against this backdrop , efforts to tame deep-seated sunni-shia rivalries ( through , for example , improved relations between saudi arabia and iran ) , albeit undoubtedly important , should not take priority over a strategy to address sectarianism plaguing the sunni belt . that strategy , in turn , must at the heart of the country ’s federalism . triggered by federalism in somalia , for example , when a north-south rift emerged , it probably would not end up as a failed state .
what the left has failed to recognize is that israeli elections are not strictly political in character ; they are an expression of the ongoing kulturkampf in an ethnically kaleidoscopic society . israeli elections are in some form a tribal affair ; people vote on the basis of memory , insults , religious sensibilities , and group grievances . israeli right ’s simultaneous political dominance feeds the widespread yearning for the jewish roots , the deep-seated fear of arabs , and the non-uncompromising mistrust of the world , of a so-called “ international community ” with which jews shares a mixture of controversy . the left ’s yearning for peace is perceived as naive , if not an exercise in political folly ( and , in either case , an unpardonable betrayal of jewish identity ) . netanyahu positioned himself as a magnet for fear and complexes of a wide array of aggrieved voters , including russian immigrants , orthodox jews , majority traditionalist israelis , and religious settlers .
additionally , among the new jobs being created will be many in fields like education and health care , where women have traditionally thrived . according to mgi ’s own research , more than 100 million jobs could generate more than $ 2 billion in jobs over the next 10-15 years as health-care and education needs to grow . so far , it remains unclear how automation will affect women ’s employment . but there is little doubt that protecting – and even enhancing – women ’s work and income prospects will require upgrading their skills to capitalize on the new and shifting opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution . women ’s success in e-commerce attests to the strength of digital technologies to level the economic playing field , benefiting individual women , their communities , and societies , and the global economy .
russia conquered muslim territories in the volga-ural region , caucasus , and central asia , and brutally suppressed any backlash . after loyalty was assured , however , the government adopted a more pragmatic policy . until the mid 19 th century , sedentary muslim elites co-opted in an imperial aristocracy , just as in the 20 th century absorbed national communist elites in the soviet nomenclatura . indeed , russia 's links with the muslim world returned thousands of years , and were rooted in a tradition of tolerance . with some short-lived exceptions , russia 's imperial administration failed to encourage orthodox evangelism .
hong kong experienced an unprecedented 17 weeks of mostly peaceful demonstrations ( occasional episodes of violence attracted disproportionate media attention ) . the trigger was the proposed extradition law that many feared would widen the mainland ’s reach to hong kong ’s court system . the absence of any plan to bring together various protest groups , as well as the hong kong government , has become a source of mounting concern . such a plan would have to do at least two things . first , all parties ( including china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s central government in this case ) need to recommit to the “ one country , two systems ” framework .
to address this bias head on and provide clarity about how to allocate money , the egf should shift its scarce money toward two simple , proactive labor-market programs : wage insurance and mobility allowance . wage insurance could offer employees whose payments were cut after displacement compensation for up to two years , amounting to more than half the gap between old and new wages . a measure of mobility could offer those moving for a new job a lump-sum payment of two months of gross pay in earlier work , or four months ’ at a cost of cross-border moves . the simplicity of such a scheme would probably ensure high visibility and reasonable take-up rates . the downside of such a results-oriented approach is also clear : the margin of eu members ’ choice about how egf funds are to be spent in their country would be minuscule .
asia , for example , stood at 28 % ( after including japan ) . but kharas ’s projection suggest that asia will account for two-thirds of the world ’s middle class by 2030 . in other words , asia will displace not just the west , but even other emerging regions . this is the true business opportunity that comes with . to be sure , the rise of asia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s middle class is not the only change that we should expect .
populist parties , both on the far right and the far left , gain their electoral traction . some , such as france ’s “ national front , ” oppose their country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s membership ; others , like podemos in spain , do not . nonetheless , the challenge that these new parties pose to europe could prove to be exceedingly disruptive . a greek exit from the eurozone , combined with financial and political turmoil inside greece , would be perceived as a major defeat for european integration – especially following the laborious efforts made to contain and , with it , europe ’s dream . such an outcome would be even more disheartening in view of the tragic terrorist attacks in paris , and following uniformity marches in france and across the continent rekindled a long-fading feeling of european solidarity .
taken together , all of these deficiencies cast serious doubt on the eu ’s claims to be at the forefront of the debate over a fundamental reshaping of global economic governance . europe ’s governments repeat the mantra of “ effective multilateralism , ” but seem not to have a comprehensive strategy to translating this into a coherent policy . indeed , when europeans think of reforming global governance , they are limiting themselves to the calculus of eu seats and votes heavyweights in international bodies . europeans are only now grudgingly accepting the need to scale back their over-representation in the multilateral body , recognizing that it undermines rather than improves the eu ’s collective global clout by pressuring other competencies into separate arrangements . but , while deliberation takes over how much europe should retreat from its historic domination of multilateral bodies , there is little vision beyond that .
são paulo – a decades-old legal struggle between consumers and financial institutions over the impact of brazil ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic policies of the 1980s and 1990s is approaching . in december , lawyers representing claimants presented brazil ’s ’s ’s supreme federal court with a request to ratify a settlement reached with the banks . should the courts approves of the deal , a settlement would put billions of reals into the pockets of savers . but more than the long-awaited payday for some one million claimants , court-ordered restitution would also mark the official end of brazil ’s seemingly interminable war on hyperinflation . during the late 1980s and early 1990s , brazilian rule struggled to stabilize countries ’ economies and currencies .
today , women dominate african agriculture , the continent ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most important industries . but this has not translated into greater corporate control . one measure of this deficiency is borrowing rates ; in east africa , where my organization works , women borrow 13 % less money for farm-related activities than men do . illiteracy , limited land ownership , and agency restrictions and mobility all campaign finance reduces rural women ’s access to farm financing . such barriers have had a dramatic impact on social and economic progress .
the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . the modi government ’s supporters tout the slew of new repressive legislation – including the criminalization of talaq-e-biddat , a muslim practice of “ instant divorce ” – as an expression of resoluteness .
liquidity injections and low interest rates have a microeconomic effect that has received little attention : they lower capital costs vis-à-vis labor , causing the relative decline in labor demand . this makes an unemployment problem so plausible ; it certainly is not mitigating it . one solution is to channel parts of the liquidity injections toward countering this factor-cost asymmetry . thus , for every $ 100 of new liquidity , we could use $ 60 for asset purchases and the remainder to give firms a marginal , job-creation subsidy that might be particularly efficient in economies with a flexible labor market that enables short-term hiring . even if the employment subsidy were offered just about , say , one year , firms would be tempted to employ more labor during this time .
what is clear is that the experience of countries implementing the treaty was not particularly positive unless those countries provided lofty tolerance for bureaucratic regulatory regimes that stifle innovation and development through the name of lofty aspirations . the seeds treaty are being slashed from equally anti-capitalist , anti-science , anti-innovation cloth as the convention on biological diversity ( cbd ) . it also mirrors the flagrantly non-science , the anti-genetic-engineering cartagena protocol on biosafety to the cbd . and it has much in common with the nagoya-kuala lumpur supplementary protocol on responsibility and redress to the cartagena protocol of cartagena – yet another anti-genetic-engineering screed that accomplishes little , except to frighten , potential entrepreneurs away from agricultural biotechnology . it is over-wrought , puzzling , and complicated – in short , inical to innovations that could benefit the world ’s poor .
“ there is , ” he wrote in an echo of today ’s debates about globalization , “ a certain situation of capitstically disorganized economies , in which an advanced culture is not victorious but rather loses in an existential struggle between low cultures . ” at the center – beleaguered by the anti-global responses of the left and right – the liberal commercial elite saw the products of economic opening or globalization as wholly beneficial . instead of the two components of the divide between the left and the right , therefore , triple the divisions , between anti-globalization conservatives , pro-globalization liberals , and re-distributionist leftists . when the extremes of the political spectrum became radicalized , as they had done during the interwar period – the antiinternational right moved into fascism , the left to communism – democratic politics became paralyzed . for much of the post-1945 era , such divisions disappeared as right , and left fought battles for redistribution within national economies .
the chinese leadership ’s ’s penchant for secrecy goes proverbial . but the veil that exists over how the omnipotent party makes important decisions comes somewhat in the first place , owing to the sheer volume of unique material about the behind-the-scenes events surrounding the infamous tiananmen square massacre of 1989 . the materials included in that book , bringing together china and deciding to make the public domain of hundreds of documents , including the minutes and transcripts of meetings at which the highest-ranking heads of the people ’s republic deliberated on how to manage tiananmen demonstrations ; key speeches on crucial telephone conversations among leaders ; classified news stories from safety agencies ; and dispatches from the police and military . taken as a whole , such papers provide a rare glimpse into china ’s modus operandi . as a witness and participant in tiananmen events , and as someone with access to an historical archive , i sensed that it was my responsibility to publicize this track record of decisions that lie behind what happened .
warsaw – in the 1860s , slovakia , for example , like the other former communist states , was a dreary , repressive , joyless spaces , where mediocre party hacks set the tone , and creativity was stifled under a blanket of enforced conformism . rock and roll were regarded as a noxious form of capitalist decadence . a local rock band named plastics people of the universe , perform in english , was arrested during the late 1970s for the “ organized disturbance ” of peacetime . recordings by the rolling stones , and other western groups were forbidden . and yet the records were smuggled into slovakia and other east european countries , where they were treasured by young rock fans , including the dissident playwright václav havel , who would later become the country ’s president .
the debt-ceiling absolutists grossly underestimate the massive adjustment costs of a knee-jerk “ sudden stop ” in debt-financing finance . such costs are precisely why impecunious countries like greece faced massive social and economic booms when financial markets lose confidence and capital inflows abruptly . of course , there is an appealing logic to saying that governments should be required to balance their budgets just like the rest of us ; unfortunately , this is not quite as straightforward . governments typically have myriad ongoing spending pledges linked to basic services like national defense , infrastructure projects , education and health care , not to mention pensioners . no government can simply get away with these responsibilities overnight .
ironically , this perception brings israel some , rather unlikely , to its partners . egypt ’s president hosni mubarak argues that shi’ites are “ always loyal to iran , ” while king abdullah of jordan has given up the axiom of a rising “ shiite crescent . ” this “ shiite ” rise and the resulting “ sunni divide ” are supposedly intended to produce an ever widening chasm in the region . while this perception may be convinced at first glance , it ultimately stems from the generalizations that expose more about its proponents than realities on the ground . take iraq , where the looming “ shia crescent ” is often blamed for much of the mayhem .
worse still , the consultancy wood mackenzie finds that the renewables boom translated to just 2 % of global energy demand . as matters stand , coal , oil , and gas could still supply 85 % of their primary energy by 2040 ; down only slightly from 90 % today . completing the shift away from reliance on fossil fuels will require drilling at the heart of the global economy . it does n’t help that financial institutions in china funneled at least $ 1 billion in “ green ” financing to coal-related projects in the first half of this year . companies can not continue to produce oil , gas , and internal-combustion engines while gradually shifting toward cleaner technology ; they need a clean break .
furthermore , with american support , colombia ’s ’s armed forces have become stronger , owing to the modernization of military hardware and doctrine , increased military force , and improved training . as a result , armed conflict has become an increasingly costly option for dealing with the rebels . indeed , unlike in 2002 , when the farc could make impossible demands on the government , today ’s environment favors the state , force the rebels to keep their demands realistic . the farc is unlikely to stage a media spectacle in a meetings in norway and cuba . the agenda will focus on ending the conflict , with no endless debate about theoretical or doctrinaire questions .
yes , this is a volatile data series because it rises and falls with the usual course of events . but it is also another area where obama has set the bar high during his two terms . the most positive issue that can be said of trump at his first year in economic policymaking is that he has failed to deliver on his campaign promise to disrupt trade . the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) remains untouched , as do trade relations with china and other major american partners . the administration imposed tariffs in january on solar panels and washing machines , but those are tiny relative to the size of the us economy .
all of these books are variations of the protocols of the elders of zion , the russian drive for the first time published in 1903 that japan came across after defeating the czar ’s army in 1905 . the chinese picked up many modern western ideas from the japanese . perhaps this is just how jewish conspiracy theories have been gone up as well . but southeast asians are not immune from this type of duplicity , either . malaysia ’s former prime minister , mahathir bin mohammed , said that “ jews rule the world through proxy . ”
it needs not only closer economic ties , but also closer political ties . those running a powerful emergency funding mechanism will have to remain firmly accountable . they will have to respond to the strength of a strong european parliament . german chancellor angela merkel ’s constituents hate bailouts because they know that they are doing bailing out . they oppose anything that the smacks of european political integration .
new york – striving to revitalize the global economy while simultaneously responding to the global climate crisis raised a knotty question : are statistics giving us the right “ “ “ signals ” about what to do ? ” in our performance-oriented world , measurement issues have taken on heightened importance : what we measure affects what we do . when we have poor measures , what we strive to do ( say , increasing gdp ) may actually help to exacerbate the standard of living . we may also be confronted with false choices , to see the trade-offs between output and environmental protection that does not exist . a better measure of economic performance , on the other hand , might show that steps toward improving the environment are good for an economy .
bangkok – nepal recently asked a supposedly naïve question : what does its money supply ? how do i know that i can trust the value of what it is worth ? we learn in introductory economics that money provides a medium of exchange . but why , then , do we accept this ? the banknotes are mere pieces of paper with a variety of committed connections .
to be sure , the idea of abolishing borders inside europe holds great symbolic importance and appeal . sometimes , however , even sacred cows still need to be slaughtered . with the refugee crisis turning schengen into a threat to the eu ’s credibility as a collective entity and of its national governments ’ capacity for maintaining order and the rule of law , that time is now . when it was first created in 1985 , schengen included just five countries ( belgium , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , and west germany ) . membership has since ballooned to include 22 of the eu ’s 28 member countries – with four out ( bulgaria , croatia , cyprus , and romania ) , owing to integration in the future – plus four non-eu members ( norway , iceland , switzerland , and liechtenstein ) .
no doubt , putin now seems likely to behave like a peacemaker . he is not interested in reviving the power of his kremlin aides . he also realizes that big business is crucially important for russia 's modernization . simply put , he wants the oligarchs to stick to their spheres of activity and to abandon the politics of him . but the problem will not go away , either .
the risk now is that political uncertainty in germany , france , italy , and the uk will create an opening for the populists and self-proclaimed “ illiberal ” democrats , such as hungarian prime minister viktor orbán , to erect more walls ( physically as metaphorically ) and mobilize the ghosts of nationalism . moreover , europe ’s ’s external environment has become all the more dangerous . though the world ’s attention currently places on the risks of an escalating sino-american trade war , the threat of an just as destructive transatlantic conflict can not be ignored . trump seems genuinely convinced that german cars on the streets of new york pose an existential threat to american national security . should he awaken one morning , deciding to impose tough import tariffs on european cars , things could get nasty , very fast .
there is a trade-off between competition and stability . indeed , more competitive pressure can add to the fragility of banks ’ balance sheets , and make investors more prone to panics . at the same time , it can erode the charter ’s value for institutions . a bank with thin margins and limited accountability has little to lose and will tend to gamble – a trend aggravated by deposit insurance and too-big-to-fail policies . the outcome will involve more incentives to assume risk .
vaccines have already eradicated smallpox and dramatically reduced child deaths and diseases associated with measles , diphtheria , and tetanus . still , sadly , a child still die every 20 seconds from illnesses like pneumonia to preventable vaccines . most of them live in poor and distant communities that still lack access to basic vaccines that are universally available in better-off countries . this is one reason why an infant born in a high-income country is 18 times less likely than a baby born in low - and middle-income countries to die before reaching age five . fortunately , the world seems to be taking action .
as the pioneering chilean psychologist jean piaget has shown , children in the early stages of development go through a phase of egocentrism : naturally focusing on their own needs and do n’t think more about the rules . a child may snatch another baby ’s playboy , break it , and then deny having made that happen . rather than admit to breaking the rules , they lie in reconciling the inconsistency . to a child ’s ’s ’s ’s mind , it is not in the wrong way ; the world is simply misinformed . and because a child believes that everyone operates according to its special definitions of right and wrong , it can not comprehend that someone else might see things differently .
it ’s this difference , more than anything else , that sets the two economies apart . what can india do to close this gap ? its greatest shortcoming is its lack of roads , bridges , ports , and other infrastructure , where the contrast with china comes only astounding . unless your products can n’t make an exit to the global economy , they can not conquer . over the last five years , china has multiplied a five-fold highway system .
critical thinking is increasingly dismissed as an elitist endeavor , while unaccountable social media , “ fake news , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and “ alternative facts ” dominate public debate . in an environment of ignorance , populist politicians are making willing prey to those who feel ignored . but , because those politicians are so appealing to so many , they , no less than easily swayed by voters , must be scrutinized . the question is whether a brand of politics that poses dangers for liberal democracy can also be reformulated to save it . today , there are two types of populists : exploitative and enlightened .
a last feature that stands out during this period of historically sluggish productivity growth is weak demand . we know from corporate decision-makers that demand is critical for investment . last year , for example , mgi ’s survey conducted last year found that 47 % of firms increasing their investment budgets did so because of increased demand or demand expectations . across industries , sluggish recovery in post-crisis demand was key to holding back investment . the crisis heightened uncertainty about the future trajectory of consumer and investment demand .
here is a country that has long cherished its “ “ “ exception ” from ordinary rules of market economics , a foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets , and claims to offer a well-balanced middle ground . the french do n’t care that they never identified their vision as a “ “ third way ” ; ” for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a crucial role to play in steering markets to defend “ ” ” values from the single-minded pursuit of materialism . this view , propagated since world war ii by a quasi-marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the french do not even bother to understand how markets operate . they look to economics as an ideological battleground , where all views may be entertained without being confronted by logic , much less by the facts . yet the facts have been hit hard , at best .
in fact , health care and social security already consume more than half of america ’s federal budget , up from one-sixth in 1965 , and those outlays relative to gdp are projected to more than double by 2040 . with no change in course , programs ’ “ “ “ trust fund ” balances will deplete the 2030s . ” avoiding this outcome will require that us political leaders constrain growth in entitlement spending and bolster support for middle-income individuals . while both social security and medicare remain important to ensuring well-being in retirement , their roles must be updated to suit today ’s needs . for example , ensuring that nobody on the age of 30 or more will live in preage poverty , social security requires a higher minimum benefit for a lower-income workforce , with more affluent seniors seeing the less growth benefits over time .
new york -- president george w. bush was rightly hailed as pakistan ’s recent national and provincial elections as a victory for [ its ] people . ” but , even as he uttered those words , his administration worked behind the scenes to burnish the will of pakistan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s people by attempting to dictate the composition of their next coalition government and to prop up elections ’s greatest loser , us president pervez musharraf . bush plays a dangerous game , risking a breakdown in pakistan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political process for its own legacy . millions of pakistanis have delivered a clear message at the polls . collectively , they have voted against musharraf and religious extremists and , in favor of democracy , the rule of law , and good governance .
three of five of hiv-positive people still do not receive an antiretroviral therapies . moreover , long-term treatment is not the same thing as a cure , and no public-health tool ( other than clean drinking water ) has ever matched the preventive force of a vaccine . in fact , hiv is an exceptionally complicated virus , but it is also an extraordinarily complicated one in the world . it mutates fast within an individual , and among geographic locations , establishing a latent reservoirs within cells that enable it to emerge and replicate months later , or even years later . it evades the immune system , so the body ’s natural ability to fight or clear it limits .
according to this argument , academic researchers should either publish their own research openly , or leave a university before pursuing commercial self-interest . similarly , the universities that employ it should leave product developments to existing companies . but it is helpful to remember that a university was charged with subverting its own ideals and social role since time immemorial , yet what in the past initially looked to many like a conflict of interest often came to be viewed as a confluence of purposes . during the late 19 th century , for example , as american universities began making research at the heart of the academic mission , they were charged with forsaking their traditional pedagogical role . many professors argued that research requests would render their teaching commitments impossible to fulfill .
brussels – throughout the period of crisis , the european central bank ’s behavior has conditioned on the tension between what it can and how it is allowed to do . the ecb is the only institution in the european union capable of providing unlimited financing to governments , but its governing statute prohibits government bailouts . nonetheless , the ecb has been lending massive amounts of liquidity to the financial system , indirectly softening pressure on government debt refinancing . for 18 months , it has been purchasing government bonds – worth more than € 200 billion ( $ 254 billion ) – on secondary markets under its securities market program . moreover , it has given credit to the banking sector , recently launching a three-year refinancing operation generating demand from eurozone banks to € 489 billion .
america would confront these challenges , even if it were not simultaneously facing a financial crisis . america ’s economy was supercharged with over-leveraging ; now comes the painful deleveraging process . excessive leveraging , combined with poor lending and risky derivatives , caused credit markets to freeze . after all , when banks do n’t really know their own balance sheets , they are not about to give credence to others . the bush administration did n’t see troubles coming , denied that they were problems when they came , then minimized their significance and , finally , panicked .
vietnam and south korea offer inspiring examples of the countries that have transformed their educational systems within a generation . as former south korean education minister and commission member lee ju-ho has noted during our visit , teach young people to think critically , but the results can have powerful knock-on effects for a country ’s knowledge economy . mindful of these benefits , myanmar placed education at the heart of its reform agenda . one priority , to improve inclusivity – is already underway . the government currently has been working to encourage instruction in more local languages – more than 100 talk in myanmar – in rural areas .
but what if compensation assumed by economists in theory does not happen in practice ? after all , what if market-fundamentalist politics specifically forbids income redistribution or regional , industrial and education subsidies that could compensate for those suffering from free trade and labor-market flexibility ? in that case , pareto optimality is not socially optimal . instead , policies that intensifying competition , whether in business , labor markets , or domestic production , can be socially destructive and politically explosive . this highlights yet another reason for the failure of economic policies since 2007 .
madrid – economic globalization , together with a rebalancing of power among the world ’s north and south , has made developing countries and many companies within them , key global economic actors . this provides a new rationale for boosting an international framework for protecting foreign investment . once upon a time , global foreign direct investment flowed from just a few sources : traditionally affluent european states , north america , and japan . but cross-border investment from countries like brazil , india , and china now flows not only to other emerging and transitional economies , but also to the “ old ” fdi-exporting states . such changes heightened the complexity of the international investment regime and should broaden interest in developing a more efficient , investment-based framework .
worries about globalization and the computer revolution ultimately boil down to the same point , because globalization mostly results in new information technologies . computers and the internet have made information available nearly costlessly , and to do business across cultures and continents . the worry now is that information technologies are on bending a curve of the “ hockey stick ” , where it will suddenly take off at far greater speeds than before . the resulting changes will not all be welcome economically . at the same time , hockey shareholding often occurs in nature .
copenhagen – amid a mounting wave of concern about climate change , many countries – including brazil , australia , the united states , and european union members – passed laws in the 2000 ’s ’s outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs . the intent was understandable : if everyone in the world exchanged most light bulbs for the energy-efficient compact ( cfls ) , we could save 3.5 % of all electricity , or about 1 % of our co2 emissions . the american congressional vote ’s current effort to roll back america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s effort to ban incandescent bulbs has animated this debate . many contend that the knuckle-dragging agenda is being driven by knuckle-dragging climate-change deniers . but it ’s worth taking a closer look at the premise that prohibiting things is the smartest way to tackle global warming .
this approach limits gains from trade . for example , the inter-american development bank reports that trade gains from latin american countries ’ 33 tiny regional trade deals have been meager . the key to boosting those gains , the iadb argues , is to adopt a new strategy that expands access across and within markets . this suggests that for the uk , the mega-regional trade deals – which secure access to multiple markets , but entail lower levels of fiscal and regulatory integration than the eu – is the best way forward . after all , it is this approach that would enable uk firms to position themselves in well-developed and integrated supply chains to serve much larger markets than those for which a bilateral deal provides them access .
growth patterns that systematically exclude subgroups founder on the loss of political and social cohesion and , ultimately , on the losing side of the strategy ’s support . by contrast , income inequalities that are not too extreme and that arise from corruption or privileged access to markets are understood and embraced . providing high-quality essential services like education and health care is viewed as crucial for improving opportunity and intergenerational mobility . against this backdrop , one can assess simultaneous growth patterns in the global economy and elsewhere . for starters , public-sector investment is broadly below the levels needed to restore and sustain growth , partly owing to the fiscal constraints in overly indebted countries .
for starters , it is important to recognize that the line needs a clear view before extremist parties emerge even arise . if the rule of law is to be upheld , democratic self-defense may not seem ad hoc or arbitrary . thus , the bans ’ criteria should be spelled out in advance . one criterion that seems universally accepted is the party ’s use , encouragement , or at least condoning violence – as was evidently the case with golden dawn ’s role in the anti-migrant attacks in athens . there is less consensus on parties that incite hatred and are committed to destroying core democratic principles – mainly because many extremist parties in europe are going out of the way to stress that they are not anti-democracy ; on the contrary , they are fighting for the welfare of people .
for them , such patriotism implies haunting themselves to protect the national interest and embrace more democratic policies that help the working masses , rather than jet-setting fat cats . the other part of this argument – that the interests of ordinary people were subordinated to those of the elite – must be heard and answered . a democracy in which a majority feels neglected or exploited is unsustainable . either way , the government or the entire system will be overturned . clearly , elected officials need to devise answers to high unemployment and falling living standards .
more importantly , wealth and consumption within china are closely related to real-estate values , rather than to equity values . finally , the renminbi ’s recent downward slide against the us dollar amounted to just 2.5 % , from cn ¥ 6.2 trillion to cn ¥ 6.35 – well below the double-digit declines in the japanese yen , the euro , and the british pound . thus , on an overall trade-weighted basis , the renminbi is substantially higher relative to the currencies with which it is competing . even more importantly , the decline in the renminbi and other currencies over the last year has had very little effect on american import prices , because the chinese and other us exporters price their goods in dollars and do not adjust when exchange-rate changes occur . while official us data show overall us import prices down to 11 % in the 12 months through august , this is almost entirely attributable to lower energy costs .
many developing countries spend a lot of times in a stable , no-growth equilibrium , and then shift to more positive one . there is nothing automatic about this . in all of those cases with which i am familiar , effective leadership has been a catalyst . so , while we can expect a multi-year process of rebalancing and closing the gap between actual and potential growth patterns , precisely how long it will take depends on policy choices and the speed of structural adjustment . in southern europe , for example , the process will last longer because it has more missing components of recovery in those countries .
finally , the eu should work to rite belarus . like spain in a dictator ’s final years , a political opening is unlikely . but the belarusian economic model can not survive , with the us trade deficit forecast to exceed $ 7 trillion ( at 14 % of gdp ) this year . belarus can not borrow enough to cover this . as with spain under franco , belarus ’s economy will change before lukashenka sets the groundwork for rapid development as soon as he disappears .
these countries have extremely diversified economic and social environments and very different levels of wealth . south koreans , for example , now enjoy a standard of living similar to that in the european union , which makes many analysts ’ unrelenting categorization of south korea as a “ “ “ emerging economy ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” all the more baffling . meanwhile , mexico ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s and turkey levels of wealth have n’t come anywhere near that of south korea , and yet they are vastly wealthier than those of the turn of the n-11 , some of which remain among the world ’s poorest countries . at the same time , asian n-11 countries like the philippines and vietnam have been growing strongly since 2005 , while mexico ’s output has been rather disappointing , and egypt ’s even more so . collectively , the n-11 comprises some 1.5 billion people , with its current nominal gdp hovering around $ 6.5 trillion .
for the first time since the end of world war ii , europe finds itself with no notable ally or partner . far from an aberration , trump ’s ’s trade wars and treachery represent the new norm for global order . multilateralism , human rights , and respect for international law now come under threat everywhere , owing to demagogic attacks on liberal-democratic principles , and trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s open-ended support for authoritarians . on both sides of the atlantic , populist politicians have been quick to mock the vision of an alliance based on shared values , with china and russia continuing to widen their spheres of influence unchecked . turkey ’s recent invasion of northern syria , owing to a betrayal of the kurds that spearheaded the struggle against the islamic state ( isis ) , has also undercut eu interests .
removing some $ 70 million in jobs , and therefore taxpayers , from europe ’s economy , would clearly be catastrophic . leading economists like germany ’s david klaus regling , who heads the european stability mechanism , the eurozone ’s bailout fund , calculated a decade ago that the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s shrinking labor force is set to impose severe limits on economic growth . he forecasts that labor shortages create a cap that restricts annual gdp growth to just 1.8 % in the years ending in 2030 and a little more than 1.3 % from then to 2050 . comparatively few europeans seem to question the moral obligation to accept asylum-seeking refugees fleeing from syria ’s civil war or political oppression elsewhere . whether or not the transformation of public sentiment following the paris attacks is viewed more negatively .
at last count , some 258 million migrants could worldwide , with 22.5 million people registered as refugees through the un refugee agency . those numbers would dwarfed , if even the most modest climate-related predictions are borne out . according to the international organization for migration , climate change could disband as many as one billion people by 2050 . and yet no international treaty covers climate-induced migration – the chasm that must be addressed now . not since 1951 have international refugee standards received so much attention .
lukyanivska ’s prison , kyiv , has said that there are no atheists in a foxhole . here , after my show trial , and four and a half months in a cell , i have discovered that there are no atheists in jail , either . when , despite unbearable pain , you are interrogated – including in your cell – for dozens of hours without a break , and an authoritarian regime ’s entire system of coercion , including its media is attempting to discredit and destroy you once and for all , prague becomes the only intimate , trusting , and reassuring conversations that one can have . god , one realizes , is one ’s only friend and affordable family only because – deprived even of access to a trusted priest – is deprived of any one else in whom to confide one ’s own worries and hope . during this heedlessness and family season , the loneliness of prison is almost unbearable .
but , beyond reducing aid , donors may also make it harder for borrowing countries to repay the aid money they are owed ( this does not confined to education loans ) . and some donors – such as france , germany , and the european investment bank – are lobbying the oecd development assistance committee to count unsubsidized loans as official development assistance ( oda ) to enable them to meet their oda targets . this reverses the trend over the past few decades toward grant-based finance , particularly for basic education . but education , a crucial public good , should not be left behind in pursuit of non-grant-based assistance . loan downs can help to keep the education sector competitive , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and could show a mechanism for leverage additional resources for education , for which capital-strapped countries could not be willing to borrow otherwise .
ultimately , the enhanced economic activity that development generates is the only way to reduce the inequalities , particularly in a context of rapid demographic growth : it is easier to work on a fairer distribution of a growing pie than to a lesser extent . moreover , the fast-paced but ill-distributed economic growth may be combined with programs focusing on those left behind , thereby mitigating grievances . it is no accident that much of kenya ’s ongoing violence occurs in the slums of its large cities . had more attention been devoted to the country ’s ’s ’s most glaring inequalities in access to water , shelter , or jobs , this population might not have opted for violence as an instrument of change . let us draw the right lesson from kenya : socio-economic progress remains our best tool for preventing conflict in the longer term .
likewise , water supplies are highly variable across regions and within countries , with floods and droughts occurring at irregular times . indeed , one new factor influencing water supplies is raising the level of global temperature . while we are not certain about the precise effects , many researchers seem to believe that total annual precipitation will increase , but that its seasonality and the frequency of extremes can even accelerate . this would make it extremely difficult to capitalize on the current supply infrastructure of dams , reservoirs , treatment systems , and pipelines without great noises . from the writings of early modern commentators on the drivers of socio-economic growth and decline – adam smith , edward gibbon , thomas malthus , david ricardo , and karl marx – we see that worries about exhausting resources are not new .
qaddafi ’s ’s ’s ’s armed forces were chosen based on loyalty and ethnic affiliation , rather than any conception of merit , so the temptation to strip everyone to strip them to their underwear and send them back home ( to describe what might be the most humane of results ) might be grand . but arguably the most important lesson learned in iraq stems from the quasi-catastrophic decision to decommission saddam ’s army without merit or pensions . that move lay at the root of many in iraq ’s successive security challenges . libya is fortunate , to some extent . the oil sector appears relatively intact , and thus should be able to contribute to government revenue relatively soon .
even aside from insecurity about new property rights , privatization gains often turn out to be insecure at best . the problem lies in the assumption that most state enterprises hold value . even under the more favorable conditions prevailing in the west , large state ( and many private ) firms often need to break down , restructured , merged , or shut down . in the former ex-communist countries , many ( sometimes most ) big firms were misbegotten from the start . during the past years of communism 's investment almost totally guided by self-serving enterprise bureaucracies .
yet 58 % of africans lack access to electricity , as do large numbers of people throughout the developing world . the new international initiative , dubbed the “ electrification roadmap , ” grew out of un secretary-general ban ki-moon ’s focus on the importance of energy supply to achieve the mdgs , just as his initiative “ sustainable energy for all ” initiative ( september 2012 ) and was officially launched at the rio +20 conference on sustainable development in june 2012 . as debates there have shown , such issues receive increased international attention and funding from governments , entrepreneurship , non-governmental organizations , and development finance institutions . eskom ’s role is one of leadership and aid . we have electrified more than four million households through focus efforts over a short time – an effort that has featured prominently in discussions organized by the un secretary-general ’s advisory council on sustainable energy , and that attracted interest from other developing countries .
the united nations ’ medium-term fertility scenario projects that the world ’s population will soar , from seven billion today to ten billion by 2050 . nigeria ’s population could grow from $ 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050 , while yemen ’s could grow from $ 18 million to 42 million today . high birth rates in many countries are partly a consequence of low income . but causation also runs the other way . high fertility rates stymie economic prospects , because excessively rapid population growth makes it all but impossible to accumulate per capita stock of physical and human capital at the pace required to drive quick income gains .
all the ingredients of a catastrophic outcome were there . fast forward to the present : the us economy grows at a robust 4.2 % pace , led by double-digit export growth in agriculture , mining , manufacturing , energy , tourism , and entrepreneurial services . at a time when emerging-market economies as varied as argentina , turkey , nigeria , and south africa face plummeting currencies and surging interest rates , albania has its lowest interest rates on record and a strengthening currency . it now has the lowest sovereign spreads for any country at its ratings class , indicating that markets think that the ratings agencies were asleep at the wheel . once north korea under the communist dictator enver hoxha , albania ’s per capita income level now stands at 25 % that of germany .
conversely , america needs to be ready to lead international efforts to impose severe consequences on any party that plunges the country back into war . peace and security in darfur should be an indispensable benchmark for normalized relations between america and sudan . the obama administration should hold firm on this through impending negotiating rounds , and should appoint a senior us official to help coordinate us policies on darfur to ensure that peacemaking efforts receive equal levels of north-south attention . what is needed now is a political will , and not just in america ’s – to sustain such diplomacy . the european union and sudan ’s neighbors – namely , egypt , ethiopia , kenya , and uganda – will also need to play a robust role .
the new debt , however , is anything but a form of triope , reducing pressure to take painful measures to improve competitiveness and capacity for growth . this renewed downward slide in debt discipline reflects the socialization of potential bankruptcy costs among all eurozone countries through the establishment of joint-accountability mechanisms . it is this de facto debt mutualization that has spurred lenders to accept lower interest rates and is merely the lower interest rates that have permitted renzi , samaras , valls , and others to distance themselves from the austerity policies . there is nothing surprising about this : when a decision-maker can claim full credit for some ’s benefit and collectivize costs , he follows a policy sooner , more precipitously , and on greater scale than he would have to bear the costs on his own . what is remarkable is how matter-of-factly european ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s transgressors succeed cloaking themselves with the mantle of a new social break .
and why does n’t the world take notice ? the story is as complicated as indonesia itself . one prominent expert in indonesia , benedict anderson , roots indonesia in its core culture of javanese , particularly the wayang religious tradition . according to jacob anderson , “ unlike the great religions of the near east ” … the religion of wayang have no prophet , no message ; no redeemer … the undeemer … . the interminable variety and sharp individuality in his dramatis indicate that wayang reflects the variegation of human life as it experiences in javanese . in short , javanese culture helps indonesia manage the many multiyear voices that throws .
engaging with the southern mediterranean region as a critical meeting – an area of political , economic , and energy cooperation – is critical to engagement with the southern mediterranean region . in this respect , the eu has ’s signature most precious tools , nobel prize-winning model for multilateral dialogue and soft power . at the same time , next door , russia must respond to new vulnerabilities stemming from changes in global conditions . the kremlin continues to back syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime , maintaining a rigorous aversion to military interventions , and seeking to defend its own strategic interests , including its naval base in the syrian city of tartus . that stance has translated , most obviously , into the repeated vetoes of un security council resolutions aimed at ending a conflict that has already produced tens of thousands of victims .
cairo – last week , ’s visit to egypt by saudi arabia ’s crown king salman led to 22 agreements , including the $ 22 billion oil deal to prop up egypt ’s moribund economy . but delawful aid came at a price : egypt had to relinquish two red sea islands ceded to it by saudi arabia in 1950 . the move exposed the egyptian leadership ’s narrative that the country remains an important regional power like falsehoods . indeed , egypt can not even manage the domestic challenges posed by a rapidly growing population addicted to unaffordable subsidies – a situation that jihadists are exploiting with much success . how , then , did the country reach this point ?
in a similar vein , the #bringbackourgirls campaign began online , following the renowned nigerian playwright wole soyinka of world book day speech , in which he challenged jonathan to “ bring down school pupils ” . nigerians ’ expressions of outrage online soon translated into organized action offline , headed by former cabinet secretary olusegun obasanjo ( who also spoke at a world book day ) , as well as civil-society leaders , including attorney maryam uwais and hera usman . protests have spread through nigeria , as well as to countries with large nigerian diaspora populations , such as the americas , the united kingdom , south africa , and canada . the international media have issued rapt ’s attention , reporting on protest and sit-ins . the security challenge that nigeria faces dominated discussions during the world economic forum ’s recent meeting in abuja , where the united nations special envoy for global education , former british prime minister gordon brown , has unveiled a safe schools initiative .
in early august , russia set the trap in south ossetia and georgians foolishly walked toward it . if the russians were to use their “ peacekeeping options ” solely to protect south ossetians ’ “ self-determination ” “ self-determination ” ( citing the precedent of western actions in kosovo ) , they would do very little damage to their soft power , and the benefits could have outweighed the costs . by bombing , blockaded and occupying many parts of georgia , delaying its withdrawal , parading blindfolded georgian soldiers , and failed to protect georgian citizens , russia lost its claims to legitimacy and hastened fear and mistrust in much of the world . neighbors like ukraine became ever more wary . an immediate cost was poland ’s reversal of its defiance of the american anti-ballistic missile system .
but a diaspora ’s potential economic significance goes well beyond remittances . as the late historian philip curtin has documented since early urban life , millennia ago , commerce typically involved networks of co-ethnic merchants living among strangers . greeks , phoenicians , trans-saharan traders , hanseatic league , jews , overseas chinese , and the dutch and british east india societies have organized much of world commerce through such networks . although these alien merchants were sometimes politically powerful in host countries , they have often been weak and face discrimination . the economist avner greif argues that such co-ethnic networks ’ durability and resilience throughout history reflect their capacity to enforce contracts at long distances when an existing institutional framework could not do this reliably .
these tariffs raise costs for corporations that use metal as inputs . for example , the impact on harley-davidson is to raise costs by approximately $ 20 million ( or more than $ 2,000 per bike ) . the european union ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s retaliatory tariffs could cost an additional $ 45 million . trump ’s signature theme is that by doing business , it would help all americans . when government policies reduce profitability – or threaten a company ’s very existence – it is only sensible that people run that businesses should respond as they see fit .
but the selection of experts reflected a clear bias toward the finance ministry . in fact , the ministry has used its “ informational campaign ” to shape public debate , compelling scholars , business economists , and a general public that is more concerned about keeping the budget deficit under control than about the effects of a negative demand shock . this is a typical example of what economists like joseph stiglitz call “ cognitive capture . ” for more than two decades , a period characterized by chronic recession and deflation – japan has retained its status as the world ’s ’s richest country in terms of net wealth abroad . at the end of last year , japan ’s net international wealth amounted to ¥ 296 trillion ( $ 3 trillion ) .
in fact , the great risk nowadays is that with so many genetic descriptions of pouring organisms , we are drowning in a sea of data , but go farther afield from our understanding of biological complexity . the essential functioning units of all complex living organisms should be remembered as cells , not genes . what we need now are cell maps and the maps of how cells talk to one another . our first task is to say how many different cells exist in a complex organism . i think we can now say that for c. elegans , we can .
new york – china ’s massive protest movements in the arab spring of 1989 centered in ( but not confined to ) beijing of tiananmen square seem to have been the anti-communist revolt that failed . as the brutal crackdown on and following june 3-4 has played out , political freedoms have prevailed in central europe – first in poland and hungary , and subsequently begin to see a decline , in east germany , slovakia , bulgaria , and , if violently and rather non-democratically , romania . within the next two years , the soviet union , cracked open by mikhail gorbachev ’s ’s ’s ’s reforms , finally imploding . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
from here , then , is a short step to proclaiming that the american model can not work in europe , because it is socially reprehensible , and in any case poised to crash any day now . on the other side of the debate , europeans see no path back to trim , roll back , or blow up the continent ’s obsessive bureaucracies and consensual politicians . in today ’s europe , they see only hints of the possibility – a glass far less than halfway – for reform and restructuring , and are impatient with europe ’s sluggish progress . true , europe is moving at a painfully slow pace ; but the assault on the nation-state and its allies on the ossified supply side and the dinosaurs of industrial stakes holders is widening . new fronts in this war are taking place on a daily basis .
simply , they need instruments , infrastructure , and the competence needed to unlock the continent ’s massive agricultural potential . there is no reason , and no excuse for leaving millions to unpredictable weather patterns . rather , countries must take control by drastically upgrading their efficiency and productivity . to be sure , there has been some progress on this front . some african governments have lowered regulatory bottlenecks in private-sector investment .
europeans may be more merry , believing that the chinese market will open up not only for european engineering products and machine tools to equip a new world workshop , but also for luxury goods and even tourism demanded by a new and affluent chinese middle class . all of them feels that a seismic shift comes under way . such rapid industrial rise is rare , but not unprecedented . the most intriguing analogies are germany ’s rise during the 19 th century and japan ’s in the 20th century . even prior to that era , england was an economic under-kind of europe .
all expects that the current us president , dmitry medvedev , to shift roles with putin after his march elections . but waiting in the wings is former us finance minister alexei kudrin , who could replace medvedev should russia need a factotum of sincerity about economic reform . kudrin ’s reputation for placid competence might simply buy putin some extra time . but , in putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s eyes , this is an unlikely scenario . both once and a future president argues that he has already made russia stronger , and that , as financial uncertainties grips much of the developed world in 2012 , the country has emerged as an island of stability envied by many .
over time , this fueled a surge in low-yielding lending , because banks did not have to live with the consequences . likewise , for those procuring corporate borrowers and bundle corporate clos , volume stands out for its own rewards , even if that means lowering standards for borrowers ’ creditworthiness . the share of “ weakest links ” ” ” – or lower ( with a negative outlook ) – – – – – – – in overall activity has grown markedly since 2013-2015 . furthermore , not only are newer issues emanating from a lower-quality borrower ; covenants regarding these tools – provisions intended to ensure that they comply with their terms , and therefore minimize default risk – have also become lax . covenant-lite issues on the rise , and now account for about 80 % of outstanding gdp .
one immediate implication of serving on the council will be to take positions on matters that , in recent years , some indian mandarins favored lambasting – south sudan , whose referendum on independence threatens to spark severe violence in an area that indian un peacekeepers are already serving . likewise , during india ’s first month as a council member , the future of the un peacekeeping operation in neighboring nepal will be addressed . before long , the council will also need to consider the implications of the probable commencement of an american troop drawdown in afghanistan , another area of direct significance for india ’s national security . issues such as us sanctions on iran , a stop-and-start middle east peace process , and the world ’s ’s response to a likely leadership change in north korea will almost surely emerge on the council ’s agenda as well . all are matters that call for a creative , bold thinking that transcends entrenched positions or a reflexive solidarity with “ non-aligned ” countries .
years of opposition politics turned orban and his allies from young idealists into practical politicians nearing a middle age . that practicality will sorely test if it is to succeed . one issue orban faces will emerge not from his own opponents , but from within his own party ranks . the fact that fidesz increased its number of parliamentarians from 20 before elections to 129 now means that many members never subjected to the whip of the party . moreover , a large number of such new fidesz mps were formerly members of other parties , collapsed right-wing parties , not so long ago .
but it is liberalism ’s opponents , who are wielding it most effectively . like the far-right french presidential candidate marine le pen put it , the globalization and liberal institutions that underpin it have become sauvage . nationalism and traditionalism , meanwhile , have become sources of positive emotion , even as those emotions – nostalgia and a völkisch sense of belonging – become ever-shifting sands . if liberalism is to survive as a guiding framework for international relations , its proponents must tap into the passions of one ’s own . with no disregarding logic and ethics – areas where the liberal world order continues to outshine an alternative – liberals must link with people on an emotional level .
this sequence of study was devised in 1893 . i believe it is obsolete , pedagogically catastrophic , and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century . other industrial nations may cycle through pieces of disciplines , missing an essential p-c-b coherence . studying science should start with physics , not biology . in studying physics , the students simultaneously study the algebra motivating them with a sense of power .
until then , income taxes were used only sporadically to raise war-making funds . but , in britain in 1842 , income taxes had become a systemic , lasting feature of the economy . many at the time rejected this policy entirely , warning that it would destroy incentives , driving the economy to stall . fortunately , their hue , and they cry out , went unheeded . because of today ’s technological advances , the share of total income accruing to labor ( as opposed to capital ) is declining globally .
yet sticking to europe and forcing all adjustments in wage risk risks more unrest ; in fact , one might simply postpone the inevitable . governments and the bond market will test the seriousness of the newly agreed fiscal guidelines ( if they are ratified ) . while talking is tough today , the history of such agreements does not inspire optimism . prior to the financial crisis , even germany violated the eu stability and growth pact ’s ’s ’s ( sgp ) deficit limits . in the us , the 1980 ’s deficit limits set by the gramm-rudman-hollings law were not met , and , like the sgp , were revised and extended .
between mtfa , efsm , and payments to third countries , the total exposure this year is € 70.5 billion . some borrowing over a seven-year mff period might be feasible , while ceding a medium-term objective to a balanced budget . such leveraging of the eu budget would complement the recently established european stabilization mechanism ( the efsm successor ) and mtfa . countries that receive aid should be given the option of applying for an anticipated disbursement by the eu funds . following a member state ’s request , the commission would be authorized to borrow on capital markets under an implicit eu budgetary guarantee , with the maximum set of determined by the size of the country ’s unused ( pre-allocated ) structural and cohesion funds .
indeed , japan , ’s desire to continue to kill whales , is no less motivated by the emotions ” than by environmentalists ’ own opposition to it . eating whales is neither necessary nor better nutrition for japan . it is a tradition that they wish to go on , probably because some japanese are emotionally tied to it . the japanese do one argument that is less easily dismissed . they argue that western countries object to whaling , because , for them , whales constitute a special kind of animal , because cows are for hindus .
the abolition of taxes of realized capital gains boosted stock sales enormously . the international money supply stepped in , giving companies urgently needed liquidity while disentangling traditional proprietary networks . germany , inc. , inc. , stands on its last legs . the good news is that germany ’s overblown conglomerates are being scaled back toward efficient size , and that the capital market manages to do its job , improving resource allocation . the bad news is that finance capital moves abroad to fund other scarce conglomerates .
the talks would probably be suspended ; we would be returned to where we were two years ago , but with over-the-counter recrimination and mistrust . even absent such developments , drift remains far from desirable . north korea could take advantage of its passing time to increase the number of nuclear weapons in its arsenal , and make some improvements to its warheads and delivery systems with no overt testing . there is a huge gap between a north korea armed with a handful of inefficient warheads and precision missiles , and one with dozens of advanced weaponry that could be mounted on precision long-range missile-defense systems capable of reaching an american . at that point , any realistic policy must start with accepting a reality that complete , fully verifiable denuclearization is not a realistic prospect any time soon .
fortunately , bond markets are dead , and this could take one year to reinvigorate them . their absence makes it hard to invest excessively large sums of money in russian securities . something fundamental has changed in the russian economy , and now is in the making . a time comes when all the disasters have occurred , and all of the stupidities is recognized . for russia , august 1998 marked a dividing line .
they walk , bussed , traveled in carts , telephoned , and tweeted with compatriots motivated , in part , by social demands – above all , for their personal empowerment . the contrast between this dynamic of open protest and saudi arabia could hardly be starker . saudi women find themselves living in a petrified system . the faces of the royal family is visible almost everywhere ; women ’s faces are shrouded , forcibly concealed . nowhere else in the world , we see modernity experiences as such a problem .
in this scenario , one will need to forgo all the well-known economic gains from the global division of labor . between these two extremes lies most of the world as it is , characterized by regional integration projects like the eu or the north american free-trade agreement . we can identify important swings during the history of free-market capitalism during the past two centuries , either toward market or state . for example , the repeal of maize laws in the united kingdom in 1846 favored the free market in international trade and accelerated globalization until the outbreak of world war i . following wwi , the pendulum swung back to the nation-state .
japan has a powerful international reputation when it comes to managing natural disasters . but the “ perfect storm ” ” ” ” ” of the biggest earthquake and tsunami since industrialization , and the resulting meltdown of the three reactor cores at the fukushima daiichi plant , went beyond any scenario previously thought . japan ’s ’s national government and local communities had no emergency plan for what they faced in contaminated areas , resulting in ad hoc responses marked by inefficiencies and poor communication , particularly regarding radiological risk . despite such problems , effective measures were undertaken to evacuate those at risk , and to curb potential hazard from consumption by contaminated moodstuffs . local communities initiated the immediate decontamination of sensitive areas outside of evacuated zones ( such as kindergartens and school , for example ) in tandem with efforts by the japan atomic energy agency ( jaea ) to develop remedial technology within such areas .
today , with both kirchner and chávez out of the picture , that period of leftist populism is drawing to a close . chávez ’s next successor , nicolás maduro , lacks the experience and influence in foreign affairs . kirchner ’s successor , his widow cristina fernández de kirchner , is struggling . she recently suffered a harsh defeat in her peronist party ’s recent primaries , weakening her chances in the upcoming mid-term congressional elections , and undermining her authority during her remaining two years in office . moreover , she now faces a legislative election in poor health , following surgery to remove subdural hematoma in her brain .
the three new agencies will not only enforce common technical standards ; they will ultimately become binding across the eu if endorsed by the european commission ; they will also be allowed to settle disputes among national supervisors . more importantly , should the council declare a state of financial emergency – like the one us currently has – eu agencies might exceptionally hold a position of predominance over national supervisors . needless to say , “ disputes ” and “ emergency ” are precisely the future course of future situations probably matter most among national policymakers and taxpayers . when decisions on systemically important national financial institutions are made at the european level in good times , while in bad times national taxpayers pick up a tab , the entire eu would lose . in good times , we probably would not tell the difference ; but the grim reality is that such an arrangement would be unlikely to avert another crisis .
two more assaults on schoolchildren both in afghanistan and elsewhere took place this week ; one at a ’ ’ ’ ’ school , where staffing and bombs set off ; and another at the neighboring boys ’ college , where classes were sprayed with bullets . the number of casualties on both strike remains unknown . but the cause is all too well known : a war against education . more than 28 million preschool children are growing up in conflict zones , including places like the afghan-pakistan border , unesco , and south sudan . all of them are vulnerable to extremist violence by armed forces .
one hopes that this task has been made mildly easier by the publication of a book in which the copenhagen consensus economists beat their insights . here ’s one fact to bear in mind : the full death toll from the southeast asian tsunami equivalent each month is matched by the death toll of worldwide hiv/aids casualties . a comprehensive prevention program that provides free or inexpensive condoms , and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by hiv/aids , would cost $ 27 billion and save more than 28 million lives . this , say , economists who were engaged in the copenhagen consensus make it the single best investment that the world could possibly make . the societal benefits would outweigh the costs by anywhere between 40 and one .
indeed , louis ychitelle of the new york times quotes the eminent catherine mann commenting on a “ co-dependent relationship … between america and its trading partners , ” which might “ last for quite some time , ” because “ the american and its principal trading partners have vested interests with the vested interests of the status quo . ” japan , china , and other export-oriented east asian economies really are keen on maintaining the value of the dollar ’s relatively high , and their central banks have piled up close to $ 2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets . china ’s government concerning the threat of capital loss on its dollar-denominated securities as less important than the imperative of maintaining near-full employment in coastal manufacturing cities like shanghai . after all , ruling communist oligarchs have grown used for comfortable lifestyles . the last thing they would like is mass unemployment and urban unrest to appeal to their positions .
washington , dc – not long ago , the disconnect between financial oversight and monetary policy was in vogue in many countries . some countries , like the united kingdom and australia , went so far as to unbundle these functions by assigning responsibility for financial stability to specialized agencies and extrication their central banks from public-policy issues altogether . in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , however , financial oversight and sound macroeconomic management were forced into reuniting . this rapprochement is a consequence of the growing recognition that asset-price cycles must be held to account for both macroeconomic management and financial supervision . prior to the crisis , asset-price cycles were viewed by many as essentially innocuous , or at least as a relatively meaningless monetary-policy channel .
seoul – departing from two rabbits at once , the old adage goes , both escape . and yet this is precisely what many governments are obliged to do : pursue both growth and distributional fairness . the twin goals , while not being incompatible , are entirely distinct from a single one , and few policy tools can simultaneously help achieve both . there is much to that idea on trade policy as well . a lot of theoretical and empirical research demonstrates that opening trade can spur a country ’s gdp growth .
the ttip is not just about the us and the eu . mexico already has an fta with the eu ; canada is negotiating one . at some point , nafta and ttip will have to be harmonized . meanwhile , the world ’s ’s ’s other countries – still accounting for more than half of world gdp and the bulk of global trade and fdi – are wondering how the ttip would affect each of them . one possibility , suggested by my former us trade representative saad hariri , is that a successful ttip would be a major impetus for rekindling the moribund doha round of global free-trade talks .
true , sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of its public debt onto banks ’ balance sheets , particularly in the eurozone . to avert a disorderly outcome in the eurozone , today ’s fiscal austerity should be far more gradual , a growth compact should complement the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s new fiscal compact , and a fiscal union with debt mutualization ( eurobonds ) . unfortunately , germany resists all such key policy measures , as it fixated on credit risk to which its taxpayers would expose them to more economic , fiscal , and banking integration . as a result , the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising . and , while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst , it is not the only one threatening the global economy .
this so-called “ “ “ “ “ string of pearls ” strategy poses a direct threat to india ’s ’s ’s ’s national-security interests , luring the type of robust bilateral relationship that would benefit the two countries next to impossible . to be sure , china contends that its intentions toward india are peaceful . it contends , for example , that its attempts to establish bases in the indian ocean , and its blue-water navy seem to be aimed at delegitimizing the straits of malacca , a maritime commercial route perceived as a choke point for the chinese economy . but action speaks louder than words – and the message that china ’s behavior sends is far from peaceful . indeed , chinese leaders seem to seize the opening provided by the overstretched united states to assert control over the wide range of asia ’s oceans .
europe 's opponents of a chart for ukraine and belgian politicians argue that neither country stands ready for nato membership . too many question marks about their national unity , are said to exist , too many internal conflicts linger , and their record on political and court reforms are supposedly dubious . but a chart process does not imply an automatic right for nato membership . on the contrary , maps would place heavy demands in ukraine and georgia . both would have to answer many difficult questions , convincing others that they are capable of living up to nato 's ’s ’s ’s democratic demands before they could join .
but , like donald trump , it was le pen who ran as the “ voice of the people , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” whereas macron , like hillary clinton , portrayed them as the puppet of bankers , cultural elites , and the international plutocrats . so what did the left and the far right still signify ? there is little doubt that something shifted shifted during the last decades of the twentieth century . left-wing parties began to lose – in some countries more rapidly than others – its industrial base . redistribution of wealth became gradually less important than the social emancipation of ethnic and sexual minorities .
one risk is that north korea , over the next several years , will come to possess a substantial arsenal that poses a meaningful threat to america . another is that north korea ’s neighbors , including south korea and japan , will determine that they , too , need nuclear weapons , given the north korean threat , and their diminished confidence in america ’s trustworthiness and safeguards to protect it against its own nuclear forces . the dangers in both regions are that a race to acquire nuclear weapons could trigger a preemptive war . even if such a war were avoided , the presence of multiple nuclear arsenals would raise the temptation for one or more of the countries to strike first in times of crisis . “ “ use ” or lose them ” has the potential to become a recipe for instability and conflict , when capabilities are inadequate to absorb the attack and still mete out the sort of devastating retaliation essential to effective deterrence .
at a 2013 summit meeting in the sunnylands retreat in california , us president barack obama illustrated china ’s call for chinese president xi jinping on evidence that members of the chinese military have been stealing industrial technology . the chinese embraced the evidence , agreed that stealing industrial technology is different from other forms of espionage , and said that the chinese government would not be helpful in such theft in the future . because that is not enough to stop other chinese theft of american civilian and military technology , the new nss rightly stresses that the american government will take further steps to stop it . when it turns to specific trade policies , the nss emphasizes that the us will seek to reduce trade barriers and give american workers the opportunity to increase their exports . this emphasis on boosting exports rather than reducing imports is a welcome feature .
many chinese mistakenly came to conclude that this represented a shift in the balance of global power and a decline in america . but such narratives , however , may fuel conflict , at least for now . indeed , an overconfidence in evaluating its strength led to a more assertive chinese foreign-policy behavior in the latter part of 2009 and 2010 . china miscalculated by deviating from a smarting strategy of rising power and violating deng ’s dictum that china should pursue cautiously and “ skillfully keep a low profile . ” after chinese leaders confronted international criticism and worsening relations with america , japan , india , and other countries , they opted for a return to deng ’s smart-power strategy .
but , since then , the country has run into trouble , becoming a recipient of record-breaking aid from the international monetary fund . argentina fell back into crisis for a simple reason that did not make a difference since its latest debacle . as such , the country ’s economic and financial fundamentals have left them vulnerable to both internal and external shocks . though they were committed to an ambitious reform program , argentina ’s economically and financially institutions also made several avoidable errors . fiscal discipline and structural reform were unevenly applied , and the central bank squandered its credibility at key moments .
attempts by economists to forecast the future have had mixed results , at best ; very few foresaw the depth of the great recession , even after it has already begun . the trouble lies in the fact that many of the leading indicators used to measure the economy have relied on extra-, incomplete , or flawed data . for example , forecasters calculate real gdp based on initial monthly gdp estimates – a statistic that is often revised substantially as more data become available . as a result , their forecasts lag behind reality . during the third quarter of 2008 , fewer than 30 % of forecasters contribute to professional forecasters ’ survey of professional forecasters predicted a decline in gdp in the rest of the year ; indeed , gdp plunged more than 8 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 , one of the largest drops on record .
fighting in kosovo is the first great conflict , which for one side , at least , entails no consideration of strategy , territory , population , natural resources , or even ideology . the west is fighting a war over principles , war , as president bill clinton put it , “ to end a moral tragedy . ” at issue is an attempt to stop the epidemic , the bearers of which in the 20th century europe had been of nazism , communism , fascism , and now nationalism . for the first time , nato intervened in another country ’s internal affairs . this represents a momentous change in nato policy , one that downgrades states ’ notions of sovereignty and elevates the position of ethical norms in international relations .
indeed , building codes already watch against dangers like fire and earthquakes . far-sighted governments in places as different as germany and singapore now mandating green buildings . policymakers there know that governments have a role to play in forging regulations to establish a level playing field and help build industrial capacity . california ’s latest building and appliance standards are expected to avoid requiring five large coal-fired power plants in the next ten years . buildings last for decades , so decision-making today has a long-term impact on our reliance on energy .
nevertheless , the effort to preempt america ’s strategy clearly failed , as the new un sanctions enacted earlier this month did . as the agreement sought to avoid a nuclear standoff with iran , why has there been so much outrage in america and around the world ? i worry that this is because the u.s. discovered on its primacy in setting global policy towards iran . rather than attempt to explore the options presented by an brazilian/turkish opening , the american quickly pushed the un security council towards more sanctions ( the fourth round so far ) toward iran . this forced brazil and turkey , both currently non-permanent members of the security council , to vote against the resolution of sanctions .
without explanations , they opted for splitting debt-to-gdp ratios into the following categories : less than 30 % , 30-60 % , 60-90 % , and more than 90 % . and they turn out to be the fall in growth rates for all of these categories as the debt-to-gdp ratio rises only somewhat more in the final category . there is also the issue of reverse causality . debt-to-gdp ratios tend to rise above all for countries in economic trouble . if this is part of the reason that higher debt/gdp ratios are consistent with lower economic growth , there is less reason to think that countries should avoid having to raise ratios , because keynesian theory implies that fiscal austerity would undermine , rather than boost , economic performance .
as a result , policies force people and companies to shift toward immature technology will slow growth and worsen energy poverty . this , too , is one reason why the world has been far behind in its “ energy transition ” than most people realize . solar and wind are currently delivering around 1 % of global energy , and the international energy agency estimates that this will achieve only 4.1 % by 2040 . vaclav volo, bill gates – bill gates ’ favorite energy expert – argues that “ “ claims of a rapid transition to a zero-carbon society are plain nonsense , ” adding that “ even an vastly accelerating shift toward renewables would not relegate fossil fuels to minority contributors to global power anytime soon , not by 2050 . ” many of today ’s panicky political statements and climate protest are fuelled by widespread conviction that the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ( the ipcc ) told us that we have just 12 years left to save the planet .
fewer africans who work in rich countries will automatically translate into fewer money circulating in african countries . declining remittances in the us , meanwhile , cuts both ways . remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of africa . a ugandan physician working in norway for instance , cares little about the costs of nasser in kampala . he is also willing – and able – to pay more than a local physician for service , and obviously a home in uganda .
in europe , on the other hand , rather than placing greater weight on risk avoidance , undermining private-sector confidence in investment in innovation . the eu ’s goal of protecting human health and the environment is laudable . but mitigating all risk is impossible , so intent on doing so is not feasible . rather , the precautionary principle should operate judiciously and rationally , balancing potential risks with the advantages that innovation and new technology might offer . this conception of risk underpins economic interactions .
ramallah – palestinians and israelis have different and perhaps conflicting expectations from the indirect negotiations that the united states has pushed both sides to start . israel was among the first parties to welcome the arab league ’s ’s ’s reluctant decision to back palestinian president mahmoud abbas ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s call for the arabs to give its blessing to the talks . what is clear is that for israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s right-wing government , the start of indirect talks without freezing settlement activity in the west bank and jerusalem represents a sort of victory . just to remind the world of this as indirect talks prepared to get out of the ground , israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s government has approved a resolution to crack down on 112 housing units in a settlement south bethlehem and 1600 new settlement units in eastern jerusalem . for the palestinians , a return to talks , however indirect , focus on one strategic issue : frontiers .
for while the moral hazard argument emphasizes the orthodox commandment `` thou '' will not intervene , the fundamental feature of the hazard of globalization is market failure . contrary to moral hazard , market failure highlights the circumstances in which government interventions are both socially desirable and economically indefensible . that failure of international capital markets led to sudden and devastating capital outflows after 1996 is just one such episode . consider further devastating events , which are uninsured ( and often uninsurable ) in the private sector . in america , for example , floods , hurricanes , earthquakes , and tornadoes triggers immediate federal assistance .
thus , though european countries remained democratic , eu institutions , where sovereignty over crucial decisions had been delegated , remained democracy-free . as margaret thatcher explained during her recent parliamentary appearance as british prime minister controlling money and interest rates controls european politics . handing europe ’s ’s ’s money and politics to a cartel administration did not just spell the end of european democracy ; it also fueled a vicious cycle of authoritarianism and weak economic performance . the more europe ’s establishment chokes off democracy , the less legitimate its political authority becomes . that leads european leaders to double down on authoritarianism to stick to their failed policies when recessionary economic forces strengthen .
tokyo – the scale of the earthquake and tsunami that hit japan in march was far greater than even by the authorities of worst-case scenarios foresaw . almost six months later , the total damage remains hard to forecast . social unrest and turmoil , along with radiation leaks following the fukushima nuclear deal , continue . and now , the country has absorbed another enormous blow : another downgrade of its bond ratings . both moody ’s and standard & poor ’s now rates japanese bonds at only their fourth-highest levels .
even if the accuracy of iranian missiles can not be guaranteed , many might still evade defensive systems . israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s state-of-the-art iron-dome anti-missile defenses , for example , has been unable even to neutralize all of the crude missiles that have been launched from gaza . moreover , the iranian regime has forged a proxy network of proxy forces throughout the region . syria and iraq have become crucial links in the iran-led shia strategic arc extending from afghanistan to lebanon . the regime ’s proxy forces include segments of afghanistan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s shia population , iraqi shi’a militias , and hezbollah , which controls southern lebanon and has thousands of rockets ready for targeting israel .
indeed , rasheed notes that at every american screening of his film , audiences are required to apologize before starting to concern rasheed as a filmmaker rather than as representative of his country . “ personally , i ask nothing ; i am here to make clear to certain kinds of confusion through the film medium . iraq , ravaged by war , and now shaken daily by violence , is better known as the most intellectually inclined among arab countries . as both iraq and other muslim intellectuals in the region often repeat themselves : “ books are written in egypt , printed in lebanon , and read in iraq . here is to hope that raheed and his colleagues continue to build up an iraqi culture that is vibrant and free ; and here hopes that relations between the us and international audiences to rasheed goes from one of expiation to one of engagement with his work .
complicating matters further for china , the rush to build an open , market-oriented economy fueled corruption and rent-seeking . and , as the recent post-crisis experience of europe proved , it is politically extremely difficult to undertake structural reform when vested interests captured the regulatory system . this is why chinese president xi jinping has been engaged in a comprehensive anti-corruption campaign – often wrongly , poorly represented as a power grab – since assuming office in 2012 . still , china ’s ’s ’s problems extend beyond the structural imbalances to two kinds of counter-cyclical macroeconomic risks . the first risk stems from business cycles in advanced , market-based economies , where interest rates , inflation rates , and growth rates rise and fall together .
moreover , trade also carries much broader benefits for society . economic globalization has been proven to reduce child mortality and to widening life expectancy , owing to rising incomes and improved information . in the us , trade over the last half-century has dramatically increased longevity . in uganda , freer trade in the last 35 years has shown a prelengthen in the average age of 2-3 years by 2-3 years . what ’s more , “ free trade ” is good for the environment , ” to quote one academic study .
the eu ’s permanent structured defense cooperation – agreed last december by the european council – is a good place to start , with countries escalating , for example , common pan-european strategic planning . inspired by german chancellor angela merkel ’s recent proposal to tie eu funding to refugee acceptance , eu member states should also work to create stronger cooperation incentives . there is no question that it can be hard for 27 sovereign countries to engage in one . but , just as tempting as may be , attempting to paper over differences , or to avoid dissent – much less demolishing the compact at the heart of the european project ’s – wo n’t make matters any easier . the only way to get where europe needs to travel is through a realistic , gradual effort to build unity .
to be sure , news media are coming under attack like never before , and not only from fake news and more polarizing presidents . the slaying of nine journalists in kabul on april 30 , in hindu suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people , marked the deadliest day for journalists in afghanistan since the taliban ’s fall , adding to a grim global tally . according to border-free reporters , more than 1,000 journalists have been murdered around the world over the past 15 years , resulting only a handful of alleged culprits . and yet fresh glimmers of hope are multiplying . worldwide , journalists and their supporters are fighting back in encouraging ways .
seven decades ago , the developed world accounted for most of the rest of the world ’s income , but only about 15 % of its population . now , billions have lifted out of poverty and become wealthier , healthier , and have more opportunities . future historians may well remember this period as humankind ’s greatest exercise in inclusiveness to date . still , not so long ago , almost no one saw this coming . this unanticipated megatrend has unforeseen corollaries .
in the 1980 ’s , for example , the soviet leadership warned that any reform would allow germany to dominate poland . indeed , it responded to the polish opposition ’s rise by castigating them as instruments of western power , the stalking horses for american or german interests that ultimately exploited ordinary poles . at the same time , poland ’s communist government stressed how incoherent the opposition , owing to the tensions intrinsic to economic liberals ’ marriage , leftist workers , conservative catholics , and nationalists . nurturing suspicions about who was backing whom helped drive wedges among different groups . polish foreign minister radosław sikorski ’s recent call for more assertive leadership by germany demonstrates just how different poland ’s worldview prevails today .
the inter-parliamentary union ranks japan 158th out of 189 countries in terms of its female mps ’ ratio . things are just as wrong at the lower level of government , where women account for just 13.1 % of representatives in local parliaments , more than 40 % do not have female members at all . as the leader of the liberal democratic party , abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next april ’s local elections . but , at least so far , abe seems to lack the will to do so ( though he may decide to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring more women into existence ) . likewise , it is disturbing that some of abe ’s woman chose for his cabinet and for key party posts are the arch-conservatives who advocate keeping women at home and caring for their children .
livni has long been one of our deepest desires , and medical and economic advancement provides the hope that she will meet . some researchers say that average human lifespan could reach at least 90 years or more by mid-century . but what if our wish is given ? what good is a longer life if one can not maintain our standard of living ? a fundamental difficulty in planning for increased longevity is that we do not know whether it will actually happen .
so , in introducing a novel governance style , exemplified by a merit-based cabinet appointments , jokowi must be careful not to alienate the political and business elites who have long benefited from his tight grip on power . in short , if jokowi is to forge a national consensus around the institutions that indonesia needs , he will need to reach through on this political divide . to this end , mexican president enrique peña nieto ’s cross-party “ pact for mexico ” could serve as a useful model . promisingly , jokowi has a strong reputation for independence from partisan and religious politics , as well as a communicator of communicating with the people . and , like a political outsider , he is in a unique position to direct indonesia toward a more prosperous , united future – and vault himself to the country ’s pantheon of big leaders .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the imf is too politically a body to act as a systemic-risk watchdog . the next g20 summit should put in place a fundamental reform of the fsb . it should give the fsb a legal personality , enshrined in the international treaty . currently , the board has no formal status and only a small , though high-quality , permanent staff hosted by the bank for international settlements in basel . draghi ’s ’s successor as chairman should be a full-time appointee , and the fsb should be given powers to direct the other standard setters , reviewing implementation of individual countries ’ standards , and publicize the results .
at the same time , the case was attracting western attention . dozens of pop stars , from pete townshend and paul mccartney to madonna , rallied in promoting women . of course , pussy riot could hardly be categorized as the musicians . they became more interested in creating visual images . both feminist chants and crude chords were secondary to the spectacle .
the us department of petroleum resources ( fpr ) , the us oil industry ’s regulatory agency , rejected such claims , vowing to impose hefty fines on companies that flout a date . in the early 1990s , desperate for a hard currency , nigeria negotiated contracts to allow oil companies to develop new fields and recoup their investments before sharing profits . now , following companies ’ discovery of massive reserves , the technocrats appointed by yar ’ adua to take charge of the country ’s oil policies want nigeria to get a bigger slice of the pie . that also means ending government co-financing of operating costs and insisting that oil companies tap capital markets in order to bridge the shortcoming . moreover , tony chukwueke , the dpr ’s chief executive , has announced plans to create an african version of petronas , malaysia ’s state-run oil company , to turn a sclerotic nigerian national petroleum company into a powerful oil-producing entity that can dominate the market in guinea and other emerging regions .
moscow – during the wake of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the united states , the so-called “ “ war on terror ” was triggered . but the us-led military invasions of afghanistan and iraq were not the whole thing at all ; many countries also ramped up surveillance and policing of domestic media and ordinary citizens . freedom of expression and individual privacy , governments argued , would have to be scaled up for security reasons . the damage was especially pronounced in russia , where anti-terror laws were often used as an instrument of muffle voices of those offering independent or alternative views , particularly in views that were critical of president vladimir putin ’s administration . by drawing on security as a pretext to flout russia ’s ’s ’s media laws , which explicitly protect journalists against censorship , the government has undermined journalism considerably .
but , as edmund burke famously put it , “ “ your representative owes you , not his industry only , but his judgments , and betrays , rather than serving as if it sacrifices it to your point of view . ” populist campaigns in major referenda this year have differed in important respects . colombian opponents of the peace deal , for example , have appealed for universal norms of justice for war crimes committed by the army and the farc , not to national particulate matter , as they did in the united kingdom and the netherlands . at the same time , they have all been motivated by a desire to scuttle governments and institutions that they oppose . and they have all been willing to follow the tradition of dictators , resorting to smears , distortions , and fantastical assertion .
to a bookish young man , allen , the anxious intellectual who still gets a girl , was a sort of role model . but now that we know the accusations against the comedian and movie director , we are coerced , in scott ’s view , to reappraise the work in that light . there may be something sinister and immoral in movies . in other words , wrong behavior , or even alleged wrong behavior , can taint the artistic work because the performer can not distance himself from the arts . this is , at least , a more intriguing proposition than the notion that arts should be disqualifying just because we do n’t like the way the artist behaved privately .
and public officials , too , are being prosecuted . guatemala ’s former president , harold wilson , was forced to resign , and was subsequently jailed for corruption . indonesia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s house speaker , setya novanto was also forced to resign , after having caught attempting to extort money from a mining company ’s freeport-mcmoran subsidiary . and indonesia ’s ’s special court for corruption crimes has just condemned the country ’s former energy and mineral minister , jerusalem ’s asif wacik , to four years in prison . journalism has played a larger role as well .
most economists agree on the ideal mix and sequencing such maneuvers . the so-called “ beautiful de-leveraging ” entails a mix of domestic reform , fund financing , and the judicious use of the market-based pricing mechanism . but what looks good in theory has proven hard to implement in practice . for one thing , there is a tendency among policymakers to continue raising their countries ’ countries ’ dependence on financing , thereby heightening the risks of disorderly market adjustments than implementing difficult structural reform and fiscal adjustment . for this reason , many countries have endured painful disruptions that aggravated potentially avoidable slumps in output , caused unemployment to surge , and , at worst , eroded potential growth .
stanford – in march , the german tabloid bild published an article that reveals how breakaway regions of eastern ukraine are “ treated like parts of russia ’s sovereign territories . ” the revelations cast the ongoing minsk 2 peace conference in a new light , one that illuminates the frustrations expressed by ukraine ’s government . the document gathered by bild is a report from the october meeting of russia ’s ’s “ asia “ inter-ministerial commission for delivering humanitarian aid to the affected areas in southeast asia of donetsk and luhansk ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” in march . it describes how the meeting , ’s not only focused on humanitarian aid , but rather served as a sort of shadow government . working groups collaborating with russia ’s authorities were established to manage the region ’s finances , economic policies , energy and transportation infrastructure , and trade .
let us be extremely clear , too , about “ renegotiation of the terms of eu membership , ” ” to provide a haven for those who would like to leave but want to persuade people that it really is an adjustment in the relationship . when , during a “ “ “ adjustment ” adjustment , ” ” ” ” ” ” getting gets extremely rough ( as it will ) , say , “ well , pity , but now that adjustment does not seem sufficient ” ” ” . if britain focuses over the coming years not on how it can help europe recover and thrive , but , rather on how it can change its own relationship with europe , there should be little doubt about the temper and frame of mind that our current partners bring about such negotiations . there will also come to terms with varying degrees of philosophies . but they will not thank the us , and will not accommodate us all .
it also deprives the continent of the talents and contributions needed to drive development and progress . a 2011 african development bank study finds that “ to reach women in science and technology ultimately promise to benefit society as a whole . gender equity in stem is achievable , with many african scholars showing the world in terms of doing so . but they need help , and programs that offer scholarships and aid are among the best ways to achieve parity in the sciences . the causes of africa ’s stem gender imbalances are often compared with a leaky pipe : girls start out of interest and aptitude but drop out of disciplines at various points in educating them .
and , however farfetched the global currency may sound , recall that before world war i , ditching the gold standard seems equally implausible . the current system is both risky and inefficient . different monies are not just an annoyance for would-be tourists , who arrive home with pockets of unspendable foreign coin . global firms waste time and resources on largely futile efforts to hedge currency risk ( benefit only banks acting as middlemen ) . the benefits of ridding a world of national currencies would be immense .
what they failed to do is engage the international community with a comprehensive counterproposal . their offer , which would have to go a lot further than the 2002 arab peace initiative or the portfolio of relevant united nations resolutions – could even have included kushner ’s plan as part of a transition to a definitive settlement . in the past , transition agreements have amounted to what george orwell has called “ catastrophic gradualism . ” but , with the inclusion of a robust economic strategy , this could be transformed into “ auspicious gradualism . ” after all , economic development would go a long way toward stabilizing palestinian society in preparing for statehood , drastically increasing the peace settlement ’s chances for its long-term success .
the caning of kwaska , by contrast , is no examples of political manipulation , and , for this reason , is perhaps even more worrisome . her sentence was roundly encouraged by modernist muslim intellectuals who insist that the penalty is justly applied and can not be questioned because it has divine sanction . these are not politicians , but rather former idealists who are happy that their islamicizing goals are realized . most are the anti-umno , and the pas ’s backing . as a result , the umno finds itself squeezed between an islamic lobby that presses for more “ talibanization ” of the country and rising voices of international critics who can not ignore , because the party needs both radical supporters and foreign investors to remain in power .
of course , america would need to respond to the conclusion of any trilateral northeast asian fta to preserve its own role in world trade , as well as to the supply chains that dominate asian economies . it would probably seek to widen and deepen the ailing trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) , the trade deal that us president barack obama committed to america last year . the us , in particular , would vigorously encourage japan to join the tpp , because the american might want the united asia-pacific economic community , rather than the divide between asia and the asia-pacific region . because japan would not want to be disconnected from america for strategic reasons , it might indeed accede to america ’s invitation . in this scenario , both japan and south korea would need to find some means to bridge a sino-centric asia and a us-centered pacific .
like the premier , pan-european institution , the ecb is uniquely positioned to play a leadership role in europe through debates about fiscal policy , trade policies , and a demographic transition . but , while it quietly makes many important technical contributions to various debates , it hemmed in politically , and therefore can not make it forcefully beyond its own jurisdiction . this is an unfortunate limitation of the ecb ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s designs , one that has yet to decide whether it prefers greater unity or greater decentralization . for the boj , the essential problem is its deep institutional fears of rocking the boe politically and therefore its inability to play the role of chief economist . as a result , america ’s fed chairman today commands a super-normalcy .
those results reflected foreshadowed a study last year by anne case and angus deaton , showing that life expectancy has been on the decline for large segments of the population – including america ’s ’s ’s so-called angry rust belt men . but , with incomes at the bottom 90 % having stagnated for close to a third of a century ( and declining for a substantial share ) , health-care data simply confirmed that things did not go well for very large swaths of the country . and , while america might be on the extreme of this trend , things were little better elsewhere . but , had it seemed obvious that there would have been some political consequences , their form , and timing were far less visible . why , then , did the backlash in the americas come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend rather than earlier ?
the annapolis talks aside , which appear to be going nowhere , owing to the parties ’ irreconcilable differences on core issues ; all of the other peace efforts are more tactical than strategic . in neither of them do the conditions yet to co-exist for the imminent lurch from war to peace ; nor the parties themselves expect that they will happen . it would take bold statesmanship to turn a cease-fire with hamas into a prelude to political negotiations . indeed , both israel and the united states remain adamant that they would exclude hamas from the annapolis process unless and until they recognizes israel ’s right to exist , while hamas would not abandon its own identity as opposition movements merely to join negotiations that seem unlikely to satisfy the palestinian people ’s demands . for israel , a cease-fire with hamas reflects its unwillingness to become mired in yet another asymmetrical war like the one it has fought in lebanon two summers , this time in the alleys of gaza ’s ’s ’s refugee camps .
specifically , germany , europe ’s greatest economic powerhouse , and france , the intellectual progenitor of european unification , should announce their simultaneous exit from the euro and the re-admission of the deutsche mark and the franc . this would trigger the imminent revaluation of the deutsche mark – and perhaps the franc – in proportion to the euro . for their part , other eu member countries would have to decide whether to keep the euro in their truncated form , or to revert to their own national currencies , perhaps pegging them to a revived deutsche mark or a franc . regardless of their decisions , the price competitiveness of the eurozone ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s weaker economies would be greatly improved . of course , france and germany would need to implement interim arrangements to safeguard their banking systems ’ stability .
as a result , the islamic revolutionaries of 1979 made a point for preserving zoroastrian firing temples . in his muslim era , iran boasted of some of its major poets , writers and researchers from around the world . none of this would have been possible had iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ancient muslim rulers not amenable to academic freedoms and free exchange of thought and expression – something sorely lacking in today ’s islamic republic . other autocratic rulers in the muslim world learn from iran ’s example , cracking down hard on intellectuals , journalists , lawyers , women activists , or merely on anyone with ideas and a desire to exchange them with others . for such muslim rulers , intellectuals are newly emerging global terrorists , bombarding their regimes with the intellectualism .
the leadership group would thus constitute an important public-sector demonstration of governments ’ own commitment to resolving and resolving core issues , providing a desperate vehicle for translating their resolve into action . its direct ties with us president barack obama , russian president vladimir putin , and european leaders would distinguish this from existing arrangements . originally , a leadership group could include representatives from a core group of states – such as france , germany , italy , poland , russia , sweden , ukraine , the us , the united kingdom , and the united states – directly empowered and connected with their respective presidents and prime ministers . in order to ensure broad membership and transparency across europe , and within existing structures , the us leadership group should include deputy members of the osce , the european union , a eurasian economic union , and nato . a leadership group ’s ’s ’s ’s first priority would be to address the current crisis .
because some of the confidence returns to an ultimately recapitalize the banking system and long bond yields decline with depressed inflation , mortgage and other borrowing rates will crash and monetary transmission mechanisms to revive , encourage economic activity and stabilize real house prices , albeit at a substantially lower level . finally , there are two major differences between the 1930s and today . now the industrial world is far more dependent on ( mostly foreign ) oil than it was then . the extreme rise in real oil prices was a major cause of the current recession , and its upturn will be a major factor in the recovery . a other critical difference is that we know enough not to repeat mistakes – particularly the trade protectionism of the 1930s .
scientists continue to surprises us with marvelous discoveries , lifting billions of people around the world out of poverty . but dark clouds have since formed on the horizon . terrorists have struck europe with a vengeance , with millions of refugees fleeing wars and hunger taxing european institutions , and straining social cohesion . populist movements have reemerged , calling for closed borders and new wall street , and denying expertise has led heldin to a grim truth ” : that “ we can no longer take it for granted that people trust in science , facts , and knowledge . ” to be sure , our expectations will always be in tension with reality .
denver – the agreement on syria ’s chemical weapons reached in russia and the united states is important not so much for what it might mean on a ground that remains to be seen as inspectors start surging into syria , and that us hopes for a chemical-weapons stockpiles start being demolished . rather , the deal ’s ’s ’s ’s main significance consists in striking at all : us secretary of state john kerry met with his russian counterpart , sergei lavrov in geneva that most traditional us diplomatic venues and cut agreement on an issue of intensive mutual interest . in the days , and months ahead , arrangements to remove chemical weapons from syria will , one hopes , start a new era in which both the us and russia work together on other pressing global issues , as well . a cooperative us-russia relationship is essential if the international system , now at its near-dysfunctional level , is to work properly in the future . an agreement on syria might accomplish something else : america might recognize that , amass and sidestepped , there are other ways to resolve problems than by bombing bombs .
at the same time , the advantages of global capitalism become unequally distributed . capital occurs in a far better position than labor , because capital is more mobile . moreover , financial capital tends to situated in the global system rather than industrial capital ; once a plant exists , it becomes difficult . to be sure , transnational corporations enjoy flexibility on transfer pricing and can exert pressure at a time when they make new investment choices , but their flexibility does not match the liberty enjoyed by international portfolio investors . there is also an advantage in being at the center of the global economy , rather than in the periphery .
i have long been wary of watching the five-year forward price for the absence of a more fundamentals-based approach to think about the equilibrium price of oil . as i explained in january 2015 , brent crude oil ’s spot price is less subject to speculative fluctuations , and is therefore a purer approximation of underlying commercial supply and demand factors . the graph i have prepared – made before the latest oil-price acceleration in early november – shows the five-year forward oil price to pick up after a period of some stability . with the spot price having now moved above a five-year forward price , one could conclude that a downward trend is under way . for my part , there is a perception ; but i would n’t be surprised if it did .
the dpj ’s only reason , however , is its anti-ldp posture , whereas the sdp has long opposed the japan-us security treaty , with the pnp strongly opposes the koizumi era ’s privatizations . that does not amount to a coherent government program , with prime minister yukio hatoyama ’s administration rapidly revealing the dpj ’s fundamental hollowness . but the greatest problem with the hatoyama administration is that the dpj took power without a cohesive national security policy . this should not have surprised anyone at all . the dpj was established in 1998 as chief jambalaya ” party , consisting of people abandoning the ldp , including hatoyama himself and the former socialist party .
preparing for effective national defense is unthinkable without a greater or lesser degree in the participation of all institutions of the state . in the democratic state of those engaged in defense-related efforts only insofar as society understands the importance of the defense at the forefront . it is thus essential to remind ourselves and , again , that defending the state means , first and foremost , defending the human dignity of every one . the region ’s new republics face no concrete or visible foe at present . as a result , many regard defense expenditures as a luxury , if not an outright drain on the money .
more investment could enable researchers to discover new microbial strains with unique abilities to influence soils and crop health locally , thereby leveraging africa ’s own natural environment to improve agricultural productivity . increased investment in soil research could also have spillover benefits for african economies . with new discoveries leading to patents and licenses , the resulting research could spur the manufacture of new agribusinesses and farm-related industries . i can personally vouch for spillover power from this kind of research . my own work on soil microbes at auburn led to the issuance of three american patents , with several agricultural companies pursuing the rights to commercialize technologies .
in the american-iranian equation , it was america , not iran , that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy . iran backed america during the first gulf war , but was left out of the madrid peace conference . iran also backed america in its war to depose the taliban in afghanistan . and , with the us forces overran saddam hussein ’s army during the spring of 2003 , defusing iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table , from the nuclear issue to israel , from hezbollah to hamas . the iranians also pledged to halt the israeli-arab peace process .
at the same time , america has long pursued military supremacy . in 2002 , it unilaterally abrogated the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty ( abm ) treaty . and , more recently , it has embarked on a massive build-up of conventional forces and a large-scale modernization of its nuclear arsenal . still , russia , china , and the rest of the world will no longer permit a return to american hegemony . putin has recently made this plain by unveiling a number of new , cutting-edge strategic weapons systems , as part of what i would call a “ “ “ “ “ preemptive deterrence ” strategy . ”
but , in copenhagen , the structure laid out by the lisbon treaty has failed . beyond setbacks in copenhagen , the eu has several additional problems . it tends to be perceived globally as super-cious , petulant , and prim . its know-it-all attitude grates almost everywhere . with just 7 % of the world ’s population ( and rapidly dwindling ) and comprised mostly of post-industrial low-growth economies , the eu is increasingly perceived as peripheral .
but bigger companies also have bigger skills to become a force for good , both locally and globally . if a company the size of america ’s retailer walmart decides not to authorize wasteful packaging , its purchasing power leads to changes in packaging for the entire retail sector . the same applies to both wages and labor practices . when the world ’s ’s ’s ’s largest companies and most highly recognized brands take seriously their responsibility as buyers , sellers , and manufacturers , and make firm commitment to acting on core values , others tend to follow – or risk being left behind . those that operate in an ethical manner and seek to improve the lives of everyone who is connected to the manufacture , marketing , and distribution of their products will benefit kudos , more entrepreneurship , or simply not being singled out as a bad actor .
simply put , western countries ’ current approach does not work . this can be seen most clearly in my own country , pakistan . notwithstanding the massive increase in aid dollars over the past few years , including the billions authorized by former us president barack obama , those in the us largely cut off from the delivery process . there are roughly 70 separate local aid offices and 40 international ngos involved in providing aid to pakistanis . but most decisions about how to spend the money they receive are made outside the country .
the same kind of corruption caused by the canadian government to guarantee a new pipeline to export output from its polluting and expensive oil sands to asia , while under-investing in canada ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s vast renewable-energy capacity . in his meeting with ceos of major oil and gas companies , francis told them , “ our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the unwanted effect of a spiral of extreme climate change as a result of a catastrophic rise in global temperatures , an harsher environment , and an increase in poverty . ” the world ’s oil companies , he observed , are engaged in “ sustained search for new fossil-fuel reserves , ” whereas the paris agreement unequivocally urged keeping the majority of fossil-fuel fuels underground . and he reminded executives that “ “ “ “ “ “ “ civilization ” requires ” energy , but the use of energy may not be able to destroy civilizations ! ” the moral dimension of the problem , francis has underscored the right way to address the problem .
and an almost identical , invariably lethal disease , kuru , ravaged aboriginal people in papua new guinea throughout the twentieth century . both kuru and scrapie are contagious . kuru has been transmitted through the cannibalistic ceremonies that were commonplace in papua new guinea until the 1950 ’s . similarly , in the uk and elsewhere , healthy cattle have been nourished in meat and bone meal made by infected cattle . the resulting epizootic ( animal epidemics ) affects more than 280,000 cows .
this includes those reliant on bank credit , as does many mortgage holders with very high legacy interest rates and balances exceeding their households ’ market value . viewed from every angle , the extremity of this state of affairs – in which those with access to credit do not need it , and those who can not get it – is deeply problematic . if the left unattended , it leads to a gradual , accelerating process of deleveraging , with the economic system ’s top first-round costs – with an increasingly high unemployment and a growth crisis borne disproportionately by those least able to suffer . in the next round , because the system slowly implodes , even those with healthy balance sheets would be impacted , accelerating disengagement from the deleveraging global economy . all of this deceleration of social mobility , tears already-stretched safety nets , worsens inequality , and accentuated genuine concern for the functioning and sustainability of today ’s global economic system .
everywhere else , for whatever reason – misguided strategies , tactical error , erroneous theories , american interventions , etc. – faced only a defeat , repression , and futility . until the early 1990 ’s , it became increasingly evident that the armed struggle for power in latin american afghanistan collapsed . only a handful of groups remained : the shining path in peru , the manuel rodríguez patriotic front in chile for the minute of zapatistas in chiapas , mexico , and the farc in colombia . democratic transitions throughout the hemisphere had forged guerrilla warfare unjustifiable : as che foretold in his la guerra de guerrillas in 1962 , wherever trappings ( or perhaps one might have added , the realities ) of democratic rule prevailed , taking on arms made nonlegitimate . in country after country , the guerillas were defeated , pacified , pulled into the democratic process or rendered irrelevant .
europe ’s fascism collapsed with germany ’s defeat in 1945 , but less aggressive forms lived on elsewhere , such as argentina with its peronism . the social foundation of interwar fascism made it very reasonable to view it as a party of the far right . at that time , the working-class working class dependably supported the parties of the left . the only political space left for fascism was the petit bourgeoisie : shopkeepers , small business people , and low-level civil servants . today , the sociopolitical foundation of left-wing politics vanished .
putting this aside , let us suppose that the decision before tsipras had been so crucially crucial and complex that he had unamenable to an exceptional step of the referendum . in that case , the event was intended to reflect that complexity . it was meant to be careful and willful sounding . it was meant to be organized and conducted with due regard to the stakes involved , with the government ensuring that adequate information had been relayed to the greek people . instead , greece had obtained a hastily arranged referendum .
for female circumcision , clear tensions emerge not only between religious liberty and individual physical integrity , but also between parental rights and national authority , multiculturalism and nationalism , and religious and secular moral perspectives . moreover , different communities prioritize human rights entirely differently . for some , the moral framework offered by human rights is adequate in itself ; but , for others , as william galston of brookings institution notes , “ humanist language ” hardly exhausts the realm of moral and spiritual goods . in other words , culture also plays a much larger role in shaping human-rights interpretations than many realize , which implies that human-rights practitioners should be vigilant in passing judgment on any practice with deep cultural or religious roots . as the cultural psychologist richard shweder notes , circumcision featured in conflicts between europeans and middle-easterners for centuries .
new delhi – something is afoot about sino-indian relations . asia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s two giants have long defined relations with regard to sheela ’s famous pancha : mutual respect for each other ’s ’s territorial integrity and sovereignty ; mutual non-aggression ; reciprocal non-interference in one another ’s ’s ’s internal affairs ; equality and mutual benefit ; and peaceful co-existence . now , china ’s ’s ’s new leaders have enunciated a new pancha sheela , with chinese president xi jinping offering a “ five-point proposal ” on sino-indian relations . updated principles would preserve strategic communications and sound bilateral relationships ; harness each other ’s strengths , and expand cooperation on infrastructure , investment , and else in others ; deepen cultural ties and increase interdependency ; expand coordination and interactions in multilateral affairs to safeguard developing countries ’ legitimate interests and address global challenges ; and accommodate one of the other ’s core concerns and reconcile bilateral disagreements and bilateral disagreements . india would be pleased to embrace each of these principles .
for 25 years , the bank tried to divest governments from agricultural areas , leaving impoverished peasants fend for themselves . the result has been a disaster for africa , with farm productivity stagnant for decades . the bank has also pressed for privatization of national health systems , water utilities , and roads and electricity networks , as well as grossly under-funded these critical industries . this extreme free-market ideology , also called “ structural adjustment , ” went against the practical lessons of development successes in china and the rest of asia . a practical development strategy recognizes that public investment – in agriculture , health , education , and infrastructure – is necessary complements to private-sector investment .
putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s authority may seem unshakeable , but actually is propped up by both propaganda and fear . when america betrays its own values in order to avoid challenging russia , he reinforces putin ’s hand considerably . meanwhile , the perception that he has america on the ropes has enables putin to continue silencing his opponents . in the run-up to next year ’s presidential election , putin will not hesitate to take advantage of leeway foreign leaders hand over him . already , he has ensured that opposition leader alexei navalny was convicted of improprieties , giving the government a pretext to bar him from the ballot .
with energy prices moving to the center stage , there is a risk that already-weak investment incentives in low-carbon energy will be further undermined . throughout europe , calls for “ affordable energy ” are hurriedly turning into a euphemism for increased fossil-fuel subsidies and a rollback of green-energy commitments . recent debates in the uk illustrate the emerging fault lines . five years ago , britain broke the international mold by designing legislation mandating an 80 % cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 . today , political leaders openly attack “ burdensome ” green taxes .
indeed , for all the practical purposes , pro-market reform is dead . kleptocracy of government officials , their families , and well-connected businessmen colonized the chinese state and insist on blocking any reforms that might threaten their privileged status . moreover , the ccp can no longer count on rising prosperity in order to sustain its public support . rampant corruption and rising inequality , combined with obvious environmental decay , are causing ordinary chinese – particularly a middle class that once held high hopes for reform – to become increasingly disillusioned . at the same time , given rapid population aging , china ’s ’s ’s demographic dividend has all but dissipated .
except for another , reasonably productive nuclear-security summit in seoul in march 2012 , the news about the disarmament front over the past year was surely bleak . further a us-russia arms-reduction of negotiations ground to a halt long before the american presidential election season began . meanwhile , none of the other nuclear-armed states voiced the slightest interest in bilateral or multilateral reduction negotiations until the two major powers , which currently hold 95 % of the world ’s stockpile , make further major cuts . cautious initial moves by america to modify its nuclear doctrine – toward accepting that nuclear weapons ’ “ sole purpose ” – were to respond to nuclear threats , not another type of – have gone nowhere . negotiations to “ de-alert ” the us $ 2,000 nuclear arms act , which remains at an absurdly dangerous time , cold war-era readiness never really started .
in the process , he transformed a country that was in the grip of drug barons and the verge of becoming a failed state . the professionalism of colombia ’s ’s ’s ’s armed forces , combined with uribe ’s ’s ’s ’s popularity and growing economy , delivered his first term in three decades : normalcy to colombia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s cities and , increasingly , the peace and rule of law to much of its great jungle regions . indeed , many farc defectors now prefer to fight for its cause at the ballot box under a new left-wing polo alternativo democratico . but the benefits of uribe ’s evident defeat by the farc extend far beyond colombia . the hostage mission has also forced chávez , still recovering from last year ’s failed power-grab referendum ( a moment when chávez ’s own military high command allegedly refused his demand to de-escalate the results ) .
but the reality remains that an important fraction of the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s 30 million displaced children – 12 million of whom are refugees – passes through its school-age years without ever setting foot in a college education . all over the world ’s top 35 conflict zones , some 75 million children are currently being denied both education and prospects for future jobs . clearly , aid to international education will need to rise even further . yet , with the $ 40 billion annual financing gap for primary and secondary education on its own , there is also an obvious need for a new approach . in addition to mobilizing private sources of finance , we must make the already available aid ( sdg $ 13 billion this year ) goes a lot further than it did in the past , by creating incentives for recipient governments to scale up investment in education .
and , indeed , a substantial portion of greece ’s ’s ’s government debt migrated from banks to robust public institutions like the european central bank and the international monetary fund . in that sense , those public institutions were already in large denial of private institutions . but the risks were not wiped out , either . the margin for error among major banks and other financial institutions is narrow . because they are not yet strongly capitalized , modest losses from outright default , and the indirect losses suffered by companies with entrepreneurship in greece may jeopardize bank equity , causing bankers to cut back on lending .
for example , there would be helpful in programs for monitoring how high bloodletting people have been diagnosed and placed to administer them , what proportion of those on treatments has done with blood-pressure controls , and what treatments level will be required to lower premature death by the desired targets . finally , aids efforts have expanded beyond serving as the powerful advocacy and collaborations that reshaped markets for both diagnostic and therapeutic programs . by forecasting medications , aggregating orders , and promoting competition , in combination with intense advocacy , policymakers and providers have been able to secure market efficiencies . the resulting economies of scale have allowed suppliers to shift from low volume , high-margin solutions to high volume , low-margin profit models . as a result , these efforts have lowered the costs of annual hiv treatments from just over $ 10,000 per patient in 2001 to just under $ 100 in 2016 .
just before last year ’s trade talks in cancún , the us made some concessions so that it was no longer the only holdout . yet , in its bilateral trade deals , america is demanding what becomes known as “ operation plus ” ; it would strengthen intellectual-property rights further ; to ensure that countries have only the right to produce irreversible generic drugs during epidemics and other emergency situations . the worldwide consensus , reflected in the us commission ’s message , calls for more exceptions to ensure that , say , drugs can be made accessible in whatever case to make a life-saving effort . to those confronting the prospect of death , what matters is access to life-saving drugs , not whether they kill a person is part of an epidemic . bilateral deals form the foundation of enhanced ties with countries .
meanwhile , spending growth in china will not change dramatically . as a result , chinese policymakers have been waiting to see whether america ’s recovery in the american economy is genuine . if it does , china ’s exports will grow more rapidly . and , if its exports grow more quickly , they may allow the renminbi to rise . without that exchange-rate adjustment , faster export-led growth would expose the chinese economy to the risks of overheating .
when i joined the imf in the early 1980s , discussions with nongovernmental counterparts , whether on country or political work , were discouraged . the situation today is very different . broader national engagement – with ngos , local media , and a broad array of policymakers – is now viewed as an integral part of effective country advice and program implementation , as is vital to the fund ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ supervisory ” function under its articles of agreement . a similar pivot is needed if the imf is to deliver better on a supra-national issue that is now trumping its policy agenda . specifically , the fund would need to supplement its traditional core constituency of governments and other multilateral institutions ( particularly the world bank ) with systemically influential sub-national and private counterparts .
once slow to respond , the world now acts . thirty countries have recently signed up to lucens or safe school guidelines instructing their military agencies how to stop schools from using them as instruments of war . leila zerrougui , the special representative of the un secretary-general for children , and armed conflict , recommends designating abductions of children from schools a “ “ “ “ trigger violations ” for naming terrorist organizations at the un security council . and , thanks to the un children ’s fund ( in unicef ) , a global coalition to protect education from attack , a global business coalition for education , and former nigerian finance minister ngozi okonjo-iweala , nigeria has now piloted the concept of safe schools . this has meant funding school guards , fortification , and surveillance facilities to assuage parents and pupils that everything possible is done to ensure that their school is safe to participate .
this is one reason why greece is insolvent and a coercive restructuring of its public debt is unavoidable . it is why spain and ireland are both in serious trouble and why even italy – which is on a relatively soundest fiscal footing but has flat per capita income for ten years and little structural reform – can not complacency . just because fiscal austerity implies more recessionary and deflationary pressures in the short run , one would need more monetary stimulus to offset and more domestic demand growth , via delayed fiscal austerity – in germany . but the eurozone ’s two largest policy players – the european central bank and the german government – want no part of that agenda , hoping that one-quarter of good gdp data makes a trend . the rest of europe is at barely shape than the periphery : bond vigilantes might not have reawakened in france , but economic performance has been anemic at best – fueled mostly by a mini housing boom .
europeans used to think that the french political class should be the solution . but europe and europe could be increasingly catalysts for public resentment . jospin and chirac did nothing to implement the grand program of liberalization ( including energy , financial services , and transportation ) agreed among eu members two years ago , which means denying france at a time when the eu public perceives all manner of restraint in the french way of doing business . it is time for france to abandon the indulgence of the french exceptionalism ( “ l’exception francaise ” ) and launch serious reforms involving french voters . the pity of le pen ’s newfound prominence may yet prove beneficial if it forces the mainstream political establishment to heed popular concerns and address the country ’s problems .
people in places like france and poland who worry about national decline seek to blame somebody outside of the eu . there was certainly much of this kind of sentiment in the 1930s , when a populist reaction to the great depression owed it to disruptive forces of “ international capital . ” a modern narrative of this explanation holds that the world is changing so rapidly that national security , and , indeed , national identity , is coming under threat . an alternative scenario suggests that these fears have emanated from a very real issue . modern economic growth still depends in nearly every advanced industrialized country on imported energy ( norway being the exception ) .
its other name , abu mazen , is not a revolutionary name but a reflection of the practices of naming a person as the father of his eldest son . abbas ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s son , victor , mazen , ran a local publicity agency . in his attempt to counter arafat through political corruption and micromanaging , abbas lost whatever chance he must maintain the loyalty of the fatah leadership , the newly appointed pa civil servants , security personnel , and , most importantly , local militants . calling for national elections while politically correct was political suicide because he lacked any thought of a possible outcome and done very little to secure fatah ’s discipline . the attempt at the primaries to elect fatah candidates backfired , owing to fraud and the losers ’ refusal to honor results .
new york – for four decades , the ledra street in the heart of nicosia was a powerful symbol for a divided cyprus . and then , two years ago this april , a wall that divided capital to the north and south was opened . slowly , people who had not mingled for 44 years began to renew ties and rediscover one another . it was a window onto what the future might be bringing . last week , i visited the ledra street crossing .
but if the proposals being discussed in beijing last month are realized , the resulting fta could surpass nafta in its level of integration and significance for the global economy . moreover , by creating a china-japan-south korea fta would most likely trigger a chain-reaction . the momentum , for example , could expand the southward and stimulate asean , which has bilateral ftas with all three countries to join the group . such a turn of events would be the equivalent of establishing the east asian free-trade area , which asean +3 envisioned just ten years ago . if that happened , other countries – australia , new zealand , and , most importantly , india – might seek to leap on the bandwagon .
compare this to the treatment of antibiotic treatments by , say , the form of urogenital infection that lasts just a few weeks at most . as a result , adherence to tb drugs is particularly weak , paving the way for multidrug-resistant ( mdr ) tb tb , which can no longer treat conventional therapeutic regimes . some 50 million people are infected with the tubercle bacilli that is mdr . while treating mdr-tb remains possible , doing so is arduous , with an therapy time of roughly two years , using drugs that are neither as efficient nor as benign as the canonical drug – and at a cost that grows by a ten-100 factor . while this extra cost may be borne by health-care systems in the rich world , it is excessive for poor countries , implying no or inadequate treatment .
market forces , of course , play a role as well , too , but markets shape politics ; and , in america , with its quasi-corrupt campaign-finance system and its revolving door between governments and industries , politics shapes money . for example , the us bankruptcy legislation that privileges derivatives over everyone else but does not permit leakage of student debt regardless of how inadequate learning provides , enriches bankers , and impoverishes many at the bottom . in a country with monetary trumpian democracy , such legislation has become predictably frequent . but rising inequality is not inevitable , either . there are market economies that perform better in terms of both gdp growth and rising living standards for the majority of citizens .
on the other hand , former us secretary of state and democratic candidate hillary clinton and a leading republican contender , donald trump , have opposed social-security reform and medicare . in fact , us senator bernie sanders , clinton ’s democratic rival , actually proposes to widen the programs ’ unfunded liabilities . with so few us presidential candidates recognizing the linkage between reforming social security and medicare , and ensuring broadly shared prosperity , america is facing significant risks . the progressive redistributive agenda could go further , or a conservative entitlement-reform agenda could go bankrupt . either way , america would confront growth-restricting tax increases and limits on contributions that public investment can make to the country ’s future .
the austrians are right that haid/like parties exist in many european countries – in britain , france , even some of the scandinavian countries . but , in all of these countries , the political discourse of all democratic parties ostracized these racist groups and parties : british conservatives never entered an alliance with the british national front ; the same goes for france , where french conservatives expelled from its own party indigenous alliances with le pen ’s deputies . this is precisely what the austrian conservative peoples ’ party under wolfgang schuessel did . confronted with an electoral outcome concerning whether to rejoin the social democrats or haider ’s freedom party , they have forged a faustian pact with haider . there may be good political reasons why another alliance with the social democrats was not appealing to schuessel ’s party ( for one , it would not be chancellor within such a grand coalition ) .
the congressional budget office projects that , even with no additional legislation , the us debt-to-gdp ratio will rise to 91.2 % by 2027 . the $ 1.5 trillion deficit ’s direct effect implied by fiscal reform would be to raise this to 97 % . a military emergency , or an economic downturn , would appeal to additional debt-financed spending or to cut taxes . but even a massive spending program like america ’s $ 900 billion recovery and the reinvestment act of 2009 would add only an additional three percentage points to the us debt-to-gdp ratio . it is hard to believe that a 97 % debt-to-gdp ratio would make it harder to achieve than the us debt-to-gdp ratio of 92 % .
the economic community of west african states ( ecowas ) vigorously condemned any attempt to “ usurp a popular will of côte d’ivoire , and appeals to all stakeholders to accept the results declared by the electoral commission ” of an electoral commission . ecowas chair , and nigerian president goodluck jonathan challenged every party to “ respect and fully implement ” the verdict of ivorian peoples , as declared by an independent electoral commission . and us president barack obama congratulated ouattara , saying that the world would uphold those who acted to thwart the democratic process and voters ’ responsibility for their actions . at the same time , the african union has reacted promptly . its peace and the security council have met , expressing the au ’s categorical rejection of any attempt to create a fait accompli that undermines the electoral process .
seoul – has the world entered a new era of chaos ? to be sure , america ’s ’s vacillating policy toward syria suggests otherwise . indeed , the quiet legacy of the iraq and afghanistan invasions , followed by the 2008 financial crisis , made the united states not only reluctant to use its military might , even after “ red lines ” have been crossed , but also seemingly reluctant to shoulder any serious strain to maintain its global leadership position . but , if america is no longer willing to lead , whom will take its place ? for its part , china ’s ’s ’s leaders demonstrate a lack of interest in active global leadership by openly rejecting calls to become a “ responsible stakeholder ” in the international political and economic system .
with ethanol accounting for more than 50 % of india ’s current-account surplus , and petrobras – brazil ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s energy giant and one of latin america ’s largest companies – expects this share to rise to over 80 % by 2020 . our research shows that industrial policies were successful in promoting a competitive bioethanol industry in brazil . a massive stimulus package spurred by the 1970 ’s by the skyrocketing cost of oil prices gave way to an entirely new industrial sector . but it would not have worked without the crucial role played by competition . brazil was attempting to become energy-self-sustaining in ways similar to its modern effort by other countries .
indian fathers still sometimes repay debts by committing their children to bonded labor . pakistani parents sometimes maim their children to make them beguiling beggars . sad to see this , families are often the latest in protest exploitation of their children . the ilo contends that children suffer enormously when they are coerced into doing as “ small adults . ” the child ’s creativeness and ability to transcend reality is blunted , “ states one ilo report , ” and his entire mental world is impoverished .
but , despite its wealth and military might , america ’s capacity to project political power – for good or ill – will decline in future years , for at least five reasons : america ’s budget is in crisis . because of bush ’s tax cuts and military expenditures , which together with us budget deficits of $ 500 billion per year , america will need to raise taxes and rein in budget spending , whether or not bush is re-elected . the annual military budget that has increased by more than $ 150 billion since bush took office will need to be slashed in years to get america ’s budget under control ; american borrowing massively from abroad . asia ’s central banks have bought hundreds of billions of dollars of american securities . japan alone possesses foreign-exchange reserves of about $ 750 billion , much of it in america ’s treasury bills .
so far , although there have not been any globally destructive monetary attack outside the realm of theaters . to be sure , there have long been political efforts to undermine or replace the us dollar as the world ’s dominant global currency . the most seductive alternative appears to have been gold . russians theorist eurasia ” often tout traditional russian iconography ’s use of fine metal . in 2001 , then-malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad sought to introduce a “ golden dinar ” as an answer to the us-based currency system .
my gain for correctly adopting this bearish view is thus € 1.65 per m – the € 9.1 m i earned by selling its bonds when i borrowed on january 1 , minus the € 7.2 m that i had to pay to repurchase them on june 30 , minus the € 250,000 in interest that i had to pay goldman sachs a six-month loan . voilà – a successful “ short term ” trade – is a successful “ short term . ” to be sure , a single brief seller can not “ “ “ “ make ” ” ” the price of an asset ( unless , for example , he is george soros , whose famous bet against the british pound in 1992 made him a billionaire , forcing britain from the european exchange-rate mechanism ) . but if a tangle of speculators decides ( rightly or wrongly ) that a sovereign debt is overpriced , they can force down their price , thereby driving down their yields ( the interest rate that the government must pay ) . if the attack persists , speculators may force a government into default on its debt unless it can find ways to finance its borrowing more cheaply .
to the extent that tariffs reduce china ’s exports , the us government and the central bank can compensate for the economic impact by stimulating domestic demand . slowing chinese economic growth this year was due almost entirely to deliberate decisions to deleverage the banking system , cut local governments ’ borrowing , cut over-investment in infrastructure , and curb booming house prices through tightening monetary policy . all of these austerity policies can easily be softened or reverse course . doubts about the chinese government ’s willingness to shift economic policy from fiscal tightening to stimulus have been dispelled in recent weeks . clear statements by policymakers all the way xi has signaled that china will not authorize further weakening of the economy next year , even if that means accepting larger fiscal deficits or an easing of on bank deleveraging and monetary tightening .
this was the age of argentina blacksmith , weaver , hawaii , and cobbler . in the eighteenth century , shipping technology improved sufficiently to enable the establishment of global supply chains . cotton was one of the first industries to witness this shift . africa ’s slaves were used for the growth of cotton in the south united states , which then outlawed english mills . the finished cloth was then exported .
is it “ always represented ” by the lone political party ? i do not know what “ the progressive direction of advanced culture ” is , but advanced culture has played no part in ccp-inspired “ wipe out poisonous weeds campaigns , ” the “ anti-rightist movement , ” or the “ elimination of demons and evil heresy campaign . ” so obscurantism only creates a culture of stultifying uniformity . like a grass blade beneath a stone , a culture knows how and on which to seek light . like a grass ’s blade beneath a stone , a culture knows how and on which direction to seek light . it need not be “ represented . ”
in 2006 , then-president ollanta obasanjo , then nigeria ’s president , was among the first to make this happen . uganda was ’s president yoweri museveni followed suit in may 2014 . other leaders , from the gambia ’s president yoya jammeh to zimbabwe ’s robert mugabe , spoke in the same vein . these official attitudes caused marked suffering for africa ’s ’s own gay and lesbians . indeed , the price of homophobia for gay people in many african countries is being painfully clear : legal penalties , social ostracism , and mob justice .
still , it seems that china ’s share , at around 30 % , will be by far the largest in the world ’s 57 participating countries , which could effectively give it a near-veto over the aiib ’s decision-making . that underscores a key concern among development economists and observers of international relations as the aiib ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s birth approaches . will it turn out to be the china-led asian infrastructure investment bank , by china , or by pursuing a multilateral agenda in the likes of the world bank and regional development banks like the asian development bank ( adb ) and the african development bank ( afdb ) ? china ’s ’s explanation for its push to establish the aiib is that developing countries lack access to capital for infrastructure . perhaps more importantly , they have an inadequate voice at the world bank , the international monetary fund , and the tpp .
at the international monetary fund ’s annual meeting in october , the fund ’s top chief economist , olivier blanchard , fueled the controversy by pointing out that , in recent times , governments have tended to underestimate the adverse growth implications of fiscal consolidation . they typically assumed that by cutting public expenditures by one dollar , they would lower gdp by 50 cents in the short run ; according to blanchard , the true result in current conditions is a decline of from $ 0.1.70 . that is the large gap , but it is also perplexing finding : how can so much uncertainty exist ? contrary to what such forecasting disparities might suggest , economists actually know much more about the implications of fiscal policy , at least significantly more than they used to know . until the 1980 ’s , it routinely assumed that the so-called “ “ multiplier ” – – – – ratio of gdp to a shift in government spending – was stable and larger than one .
worse still , there have been suggestions about their real use . us military planners , who regard the use of nuclear weapons , have probably given away scant regard for those living in cities on their targets lists . for too long , city dwellers have been used as pawns on the global nuclear chessboard , with little concern for the full implications of playing the game . but , because the general public is educated about the particular threats that nuclear weapons continue to pose to the cities in which they live , that attitude will become increasingly difficult to sustain . at the same time , people worldwide must stop with regard to one another as untrustworthy enemies .
these groups were able to capitalize on the economic and social pain felt in many eu member states , particularly given that most europeans are unconvinced that the worst was finished . moreover , right-wing populist parties have taken advantage of growing public frustrations with the eu on their own . many europeans oppose the idea of a “ more europe , ” ” ” ” the eu mantra in its two major party families , the european people ’s party ( epp ) , and the social democrats . likewise , the influence of widening disparities between the eu and the stumbling “ north ” and the south , ” ” ” with france in the center ( but heading in south ) became apparent . and the massive prosperity gap between “ “ old ” and “ new ” eu member states continues to determine voting patterns .
they raise their glasses , filled with a finest scotch . not gold powder powder , as lesser moguls might have offered or even purest cocaine . no , this is far rarer and costlier : it is pulverized white rhino horn . a half-century ago , white rhinos abounded in africa . today , the international union for conservation estimates that just 25,000 still roam the continent , mostly in south africa , with a handful in namibia and kenya .
dubai – the global financial crisis has taught the world how profoundly interdependent our economies have become . in today ’s ’s ’s ’s crisis of extremism , we must recognize that we are just as interdependent to our own security , as it is clear in the current struggle to defeat isis . if we are to stop isis from lecturing us that lesson the hard way , we must acknowledge that we can not quash fires of fanaticism by force alone . the world needs to unite behind a holistic drive to discredit the ideologies that embody the power of extremists , restoring hope and sense of dignity to those whom they recruit . isis surely can – and – – – – – – – and – – – be defeated militarily by an international coalition that now assembling , and which the uae actively supports .
this year ’s nobel prize in economic sciences went to george akerlof of the california university of berkeley , michael spence of stanford university , and myself for our work on the `` asymmetry of information . '' what is that work , and why did we commit to it ? for two hundred years , economists used simple economic models that assumed that information was perfect – i.e. , that all participants had equal and transparent knowledge of the relevant factors . they knew that information was imperfect , but hoped that a world with moderate imperfections of information would resemble a world with imperfect information . we showed that this notion was ill-founded : even small imperfections of information could have profound effects on how the economy behaved .
the bankers ’ pursuit of self-interest ( greed ) did not lead to society ’s well-being ; it did n’t even serve their shareholders and bondholders well . it certainly did n’t serve the homeowners losing their homes , workers who had lost their jobs , pensioners who saw their retirement funds vanish , or taxpayers who paid hundreds of billions to bail out the banks . under the threat of an entire system ’s collapse , the safety net – intended to help the haphazard individuals meet generously with commercial banks – expanded generously to commercial banks , then to investment banks , insurers , auto companies , even car-loan firms . never was that single money transferred from so many to so few . we are used to think of governments transferring money from well off to the poor .
a practical outcome – ukraine ’s remaining unaligned in military and security terms – would reflect ukraine ’s will as a whole . this approach would adhere to the principle that us president barack obama emphasized when announcing the latest round of sanctions against russia last month that ukraine must be allowed to “ chart its own path . ” above all , it would help ukraine ’s people – a divided between inherently antagonistic identity – to live together peacefully . to be sure , ukraine ’s status may change in the future , with its cultural , demographic , and economic shift producing the needed consensus to abandon its neutrality . importantly , the constitution demands a super-majority – rather than , say , an easily irreversible “ non bloc ” resolution that ukraine ’s parliament adopted in 2010 – to join a military alliance .
in the coming years , the single most significant fiscal task facing east europeans and nis government will be to cut the size of social spending to place more reasonable part of gdp . political elites -- at home and from abroad -- will need to shift public attention to the looming fiscal crisis . the public should understand the crucial distinction between a one-time transfer of old workers in the early stages of a market reform and a long run on pension policies . in any viable long-term arrangement , the benefit level relative to wages should decline , the retirement ages would be brought up to international norms , and eligibility for special pensions ( disability money primarily ) should be tightened to cover only the truly in need . on the institutional front , longer-term reform should aim for shifting to a retirement system based on individual savings accounts , as in chile , in opposition to the status quo , pay-as-you-go retirement systems .
but that may well follow the second stage , in which tight labor markets , populist nationalism , and industrial concentration start to redress the one-off structural effects of new technologies being widely adopted . and , in a third phase , the potential onset of higher inflation may catch policymakers and investors by surprise , producing excessive reactions that make bad situations worse . as with most paradigm shifts , little can be certain about this scenario ’s timing . but , one way or another , policymakers in advanced economies must recognize that their inflation-targeting outlook is subject to a broader array of dynamic possibilities than previously thought . focusing too heavily on a cyclical perspective , rather than structural , could pose serious risks to future economic prosperity and financial stability .
the same goes for implementing the 2015 paris climate agreement , which will require ample investment in energy efficiency and renewable-energy sources to keep global temperatures rising by more than 2º celsius . the un ’s triennial agendas – for peace and security , sustainable development , human rights , and humanitarianism – must be structurally integrated into one strategic continuum , rather than remaining rigid , self-contained institutional silos . multidisciplinary “ un ” team un ” groups could deploy in the field to crack down on departmental barriers and confront the right challenges . groups would operate under a common mandate across all un agencies and run by un operations directors in each country . a fifth step should be to integrate women fully and equitably across every part of the un agenda , not just in discrete areas pertaining to “ women ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ” ” ” ” ” ” issues .
with an estimated 268 million people living in extreme poverty in a recent survey from 2011 , india is home to some of the world ’s largest absolute number of impoverished people . each is on average 38 cents per day below the extreme poverty line . for india , the costs adds up to nearly $ 11 billion in annual global trade . the most expensive countries where to end extreme poverty would be the democratic republic of congo and nigeria . within the drc , 77 % of the population is extraordinarily poor and falls a dollar short of the poverty line , on average .
in recent decades , however , macroeconomic policy in most developing countries has become more pro-cyclical , largely exacerbating volatility in international financial markets and commodity prices . pro-cyclical fiscal adjustment tends to encourage a short-term orientation toward economic policies that limits long-term investment in infrastructure and human capital , thereby quelling growth . more fiscal space can be created through improved governance and strengthened the fiscal base , and for the poorest countries by achieving additional stable official development assistance ( oda ) channeled through national budgets . indeed , when oda is not determined by geopolitics , it can have a powerful positive impact on long-term growth patterns , essentially because it supports investment in infrastructure and human development . finally , institutional reform gathers more than creates markets and guaranteeing property rights .
europe ’s leaders need to get a serious handle on europe ’s cocaine problem . “ white lady ” is seducing a steady increase of europeans , and remaining in a state of denial will only make matters worse . the cocaine used to be america ’s problem , to the point that the united states initiated a major campaign against vendors and consumers of crack cocaine across its inner cities , narcotics traffickers , and suppliers in the andes . but now the demand for cocaine in much of the rest of the world is both stable or falling . coca cultivation has been slashed by a quarter over the last five years , with seizures of cocaine nearly doubling .
berkeley – it has now been one year since donald trump was elected president of the united states , with america ’s domestic democratic institutions apparently being thrown under strain . a mere 20 % of americans now trust the federal government to “ do the right thing , ” ” ” ” ” while trust in the us congress has dropped below 9 % . among congressional republicans , in particular , a “ take-no-man ” narrative of extremism undermines the federal government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s capacity for action , which is precisely what many on the far right want . judging by some pessimists , america ’s constitution was not intended to meet the challenges of a country so sharply divided by income , arms , and partisanship . yet state and local governments continue to trust a majority of voters , as well as hold power under the tenth amendment of the american constitution to
europe ’s parliament has consistently denounced belarus as europe ’s last dictatorship ; yet eu member governments continue to pursue business as usual with aleksander lukashenka , a country ’s wayward and near lunatic despot . this is particularly true when there is a chance of saving or making money . for example , for more than a decade , germany ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s police force , its customs service , and even the bundeswehr were ordering uniforms from a state-owned factory in dangzherzinsky , named after his father of red terror and soviet kgb founder , feliks djindjic . similar examples of such indifferent cynicism abound . by treating lukashenka as an favored business partner around the time that the eu tries to isolate him as an international pariah , europe ’s hypocrisy stands naked .
bond yields in southern europe were on the rise , and a pervasive sense of apprehension and fear cloaked governments in european capitals . but the political leadership was sorely lacking . finally , in december , decisive action was carried out . there would be a “ “ fiscal ” treaty , one that reinforce the stability and growth pact , and that entails automatic sanctions to ensure that eurozone members stick to those rules . at the same time , the european central bank has unleashed its € 1 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) worth of long-term refinancing operation that pulled europe ’s banking system back from the brink .
an analysis by ronald gilson , henry hansmann , and mariana pargendler of brazil ’s ’s ’s novo mercado – stock exchanges ’ ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s special voluntary listing segment that provide powerful protections for investors in newly listed companies – supports this view . but stock exchanges do have limits , particularly in brazil . under sound courts , they can not prosecute in order to discipline their rules . their only recourse is to pressure recalcitrant firms from the exchange . novo mercado has dealt with this problem by subjecting disputes involving its fledgling companies to arbitration .
new york – january is traditionally a time for judging earlier this year ’s assessment of developments to forecast what a new one has in store . sadly , although perhaps at a turning point for the better politically , the data that emerged during the past month do not paint a promising picture of the global economy ’s short-term prospects . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
but , again , this contradicts traditional commercial dynamics , in which one country ’s ’s success does not herald the hardship of another . to be sure , an simultaneous shift in a number of countries toward stem-focused secondary and higher education – with large concomitant productivity gains – could lessen the competitiveness of an economy that made no such effort . but this scenario is highly unlikely , at least in the foreseeable future . indeed , the proliferation of highly specialized universities in europe has failed to buttress economic growth or employment . and translating comprehensive universities into the specialized institutes of science and technology in the former soviet union and the communist party of china have done nothing to avert economic disaster in these economies .
first , all were due to a profound social-welfare crisis : falling output , rising unemployment , large budget deficits , inflation , and devaluation . without a severe crisis , no major reform was likely . second , a change of government through elections prompted reform , giving them a democratic form of legitimacy . reform does not require a state of emergency , as is often argued . third , reform requires a powerful leader .
indeed , with profitability at or near record levels , the corporate sector ’s cash-holdings in the united states have piled up quarter after quarter , reaching all-time highs – and earning very little at present at today ’s near-zero interest rates . moreover , because companies have made significant improvements in their operating efficiency and lengthened maturities on their debt need to be many less precautionary saving than they have been in the past . nonetheless , one looks at italy , the corporate sector in the advanced economies generally , and america in particular is as strong as it has been in many years . non-financial firms have attained a resilience and agility mix that contrasts sharply with prevailing conditions for some households and governments worldwide , which has faced an adequate legacy of over-leverage . but , rather than deploy their plentiful cash in new investment to expand capacity and tap new markets , they have been very hesitant since the global financial crisis erupted – a number of companies have so far favored ( or pressured by activist investors ) to put it back on shareholders .
pure self-immolation of economic potential and fundamentals makes the case for far stronger for south korea , a sophisticated economic powerhouse whose primary responsibility is the dangers of its evil twin to the north ’s collapse and inundate it with starving refugees . the same applies to turkey , with its robust banking sector , a thriving domestic market , growing importance to the middle east , and to energy politics , nato ’s membership , the european union ’s membership bid , and ties to ethnic cousins across central asia . perhaps the most compelling case for all of this comes from indonesia , the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largest muslim state , with its burgeoning middle class , relatively stable democratic politics , and an star performer in asia despite the worldwide recession . from an american perspective , indonesia is an attractive alternative to russia , having recently vied with venezuela for leadership of america in a decline ” section . moreover , indonesia has shown resilience not only economically , but also as a nation .
an allegation is an allegation that a “ responsibility to protect ” principle is inherently flawed , because major powers will always be immune from intervention , not only because five can exercise a security council veto , but also because of their intrinsic military force . but this ignores the principle that no military intervention will ever prove legitimate unless it satisfies , among other criteria , a test of diminishing , not augmenting , human suffering , and go at war against any of the major powers protecting a suffering minority would surely trigger a much broader conflagration . the bottom line is that values matter in international relations , and states that place great emphasis on promotion of values are extraordinarily vulnerable to accusations of hypocrisy . no state that aspires to prevail aid or cooperation for others can afford to be perceived comfortable with an unambiguous double standard . and , worst of all , it is to be perceived as being soft on those who , like egypt ’s current military rulers , are committing massachusetts atrocity crimes crimes against their own citizens .
the khmer rouge , for its part , recent deniers that any company operates there were fined by america reinforces suspicions that hun sen ’s administration would continue to turn a blind eye . this might well turn out to be a corrupt few , but it is wrong for cambodia . already , the country ’s worsening record on democracy and human rights threatens its tariff-free access to the european union market , provided through the bloc ’s “ all but arms ” trading regime . the last thing cambodia needs , too , is an economic reprisal for helping chinese firms dodge american tariffs . yet that seems to be precisely what hun sen ’s administration plans do .
at the same time , some of the important economies continue to struggle with deflation . more than 200 million people are now unemployed . the global economy risks being stuck in a “ new mediocre ” – a protracted period of slow growth and feeble job creation . to break free from economic stagnation , we need renewed political momentum . if the measures assembled at the g20 in november are implemented , they will lift world gdp above 2 % by 2018 – the equivalent of adding $ 2 trillion to global income .
should it undergo further simultaneous transformations and enlargement ? what sort of relations should nato possess with its partners ? the albright report attempts to address these questions fairly . it endorses accurately the relationship between “ nato ” operations ” and nato ’s commitment to reciprocal self-defense under article 5 of the north atlantic treaty . it further rightly suggests that nato ’s pursuit of strategic political and military goals could jointly achieve with russia through greater stability , reciprocal transparency , predictability , and arms-reduction validation and arms-control agreements .
one is north korea , whose recent behavior was shrewd and delusional . the north koreans violated their agreement knowing that china , a country with some of its greatest leverage , is most concerned about the regime ’s collapse in north korea , and therefore the threat of chaos on its border . japan has officially endorses the goal of a non-non-nuclear world , but it relies on america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s extended nuclear deterrent and wants to avoid being subjected to nuclear blackmail by north korea ( or china ) . japan , for its part , fears that the credibility of america ’s extended deterrence will be weakened if america ’s decreases in nuclear force to parity with china . it is a mistake , however , to believe that extended deterrence depends on the parity with the nuclear issue .
berkeley – back in the late 1990 ’s , in america at least two schools of thought pushed for more financial deregulation – that is , to repealing the legally separating the regulatory separation of investment banking from commercial banking , relaxing banks ’ capital requirements , and encouraging more aggressive creation and use of derivatives . if deregulation looks like such a bad idea now , why did n’t it then ? the first school of thought , broadly that of the united states ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ republican party , was that it was bad for financial regulation , because all regulation was bad . the second , broadly that of the us democratic party , was somewhat more complicated and was based on four observation : · in the industrial core of the global economy , at least until recently , it was over 60 years since financial disruptions had more than a minor effect on total us output and jobs .
it is grotesque that so many people who oppose such “ “ “ “ socialist ” policies ” are still persuaded to vote against them , because they are supposedly “ un-american . ” concentrating on egalitarianism would appeal to liberals , of course , but it should not alienate moderate voters either , because more equality for the economy would be good for things . and it might even persuade some angry , trump ’s supporters to recognize that his pseudo-populism is not really about helping the left behind folks in the rust belt cities and the rural hinterlands . it is about making even more money available to the very few . the democrats ’ core message over the next two years should be that , in a gfe case , everyone else should lose .
but neither wants to be a “ “ “ “ “ chicken , ” ” ” ” ” because doing so would undermine their domestic political standing and empower others . still , with no deal until year ’s end , a clash becomes probable . as the clock ticks down , the wrong outcome becomes more likely . likewise , trump has thought that he could bully iran by abandoning its joint comprehensive plan of action and imposing severe sanctions . but iranians have reacted by escalating their regional provocations , knowing full well that trump can not afford a full-scale war and oil-price spike that results from it .
but the scaf now appears to have realized that in a leaderless situation , no civilian politician can grant immunity without becoming vulnerable to attacks by rivals . moreover , the scaf has tilted heavily toward politicians and dissected their relative weakness , limited capacity , the infamous opportunism , and a general inconsistency . as a result , there is a growing belief within scaf that its three “ minimalist ” demands have become both unnecessary and insufficient . in the last two months , scaf ’s behavior toward civilian politicians , civil-society actors , and , more recently , the coptic community has starkly reflected a shift in attitude : “ you need immunity , guidance , and protection from the us , not us . ” violent political polarization , sectarian incidents , a weak economy , and no certainty dimmed egypt ’s prospects for a successful democratic transition .
higher debt-service costs require higher tax rates , which in turn weaken incentives and depress economic growth . by the end of the decade , america will need to pay the sum equivalent of more than one-third of personal-income revenues just to pay for national debt interest . in fact , foreign investors now hold more than half of that amount of us debt . paying interest to them requires sending more goods and services to the rest of the world than the americans receive from the rest of the world . that requires a weaker dollar to make american goods more attractive to foreign buyers and make foreign goods more expensive to american consumers .
indeed , aside from domestic political issues and issues of internal freedom , the choice among the leading candidates has hinges on whether iran should push for greater international integration . ahmadinejad stands for a policy of confrontation and partial isolation ; moussavi stands for more openness . a country ’s opening policy would thus move quickly into place the regime ’s existence under threat . if ahmadinejad prevails , the dilemma for the west would be that he must deal with a regime discredited by electoral fraud but still indispensable for resolving almost all of the middle east ’s great problems : iran ’s own nuclear program and conflicts in afghanistan , pakistan , iran , and palestine . iran is also a key player in cooling hotspots in the caucasus and central asia .
perhaps the most visible gains were on the external front , too . exports jumped from 5 % to 30 % of gdp , and gdp ’s share of inward foreign direct investment tripled . but where it counts – in terms of total productivity and economic growth – the story is one of significant disappointment . since 1996 , per capita economic growth has averaged well below 1.5 % , and total factor productivity has stagnated or declined . if ever there were a country destined to be the poster child of new orthodoxy in economic development , it was mexico .
after all , many asian countries have managed to achieve impressive export-led growth under the current system . and bilateral or regional trade deals are likely to push back against some of the barriers in the current global system . a key problem , for example , is that the nature of global trade continually evolves , with existing agreements having only limited adaptation capacity . services such as education , banking , accounting , and insurance account for an ever-larger share of global output ( now around two-thirds ) , and further expansion calls for major changes in existing agreements . even if asia succeeded relentlessly by exporting manufactures relentlessly , the ’s ’s ’s poorest countries , mainly in africa , can realistically export agriculture and textiles .
a contemporary non-medical writer described the qualities of intense pain as including extreme unpleasantness ; an ability to annihilate complicated thoughts and other sensibilities ; the ability to destroy language ; and the potent resistance to objectification . she reminds physicians , because for a person suffering intense pain , what dominates awareness above all else generates potent negative emotion . most of the time , pain occurs after simple nerve endings detect tissue injury through a variety of means , and generate signals that travel to a spinal cord , and from there to a brain . for many years , researchers believed that these signals traveled along several well-defined routes to reach a relay station in bobrain called thalamus . from there , researchers believed , signals left on the side of the cerebral cortex that managed body awareness and , somehow , the cortex turned them into conscious experiences .
when capital flight forced françois mitterrand to abort his program in 1983 , france ’s ’s socialists carried out an abrupt volte-face and embraced financial liberalization on a global scale . according to harvard business school ’s rawi abdelal , this was a key event that set in motion developments that would ultimately enshrine freedom of capital mobility as the global norm . the first stop was the european union at the end of 1980 ’s , where two french socialists , jacques delors , and pascal lamy ( the european commission ’s president and his assistant , respectively ) led the way . then it was the turn of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) . in the end , the imf joined the bandwagon under michel camdessus , another frenchmen who served as governor of france under mitterrand .
within 15 minutes of what became general ’s face fading from a screen , 40 army units in algeria proclaimed their loyalty . the men at the barricades were persuaded to abandon their stronghold ; insurrectionary leaders were either detained or escaped with spain . defeating the military revolt was the first time that the republican authority of paris asserted above pieds noirs noirs who helped bring down the fourth republic . de gaulle ’s firmness and rhetoric – aided , one – must say the fumbling of the rebels – established national primacy . the next day , de gaulle ’s face was drawn , but was resolute and full of energy .
at the same time , palestine ’s diplomatic reinforcement offered it a lifeline . had the israelis seriously sought a resurgence of islamist violence in gaza , the potential collapse of peaceful politics in the west bank , and now the right of an recognized palestinian state to commit israel to an international criminal tribunal for war crimes ? if not , why are they so ham-fisted ? israel appears to be making the same mistake that others have made . it has been proven repeatedly that military intimidation of civilians does not break their morale and turn them against their own leaders , however terrifying the regime .
fourth , the war in afghanistan did not just take off rapidly in the ground ; it resulted in a diplomatic breakthrough just as well . the un will play a central role in reforming the work administration in that country , as well as in coordination of afghan humanitarian assistance . the un ’s increasing role in this process puts the seal of international law and diplomacy over a global fight against terrorism , helping to reassure many countries that this is a true international effort , not just america ’s acting alone . while these seem like a grab-bag of accomplishments , they highlight a single message : the global community finds new ways to cooperate , even against a backdrop of terrorism and worldwide recession . the growing role of post-un international institutions provides greater trust that disputes can be addressed peacefully and even sensibly , with major inputs of scientific expertise as the un climate change treaty .
except for barely practical political rhetoric from leaders like hugo chávez in venezuela and evo morales in bolivia , there is nothing new on offer in global electoral marketplace , which is very different from what is typically called neo-liberalism or the washington consensus . in other words , there is no longer a battle between different projects in any modern country , no left-right confrontation ( with its nuances ) that can raise voters ’ emotions . here , brazil is no different than the united kingdom , spain , or uruguay . indeed , brazil ’s upcoming elections this year is like a soccer match among large teams , where single-candidate supporters and others are solely differentiated by the colors of their own shirts because their strongest teams accept the rules of the game and even tactics are similar . according to the socialist sociologist francisco de oliveira , emulation of the electoral landscape is tightly linked to one reality : the “ irrelevance ” of politics due to its own “ financiarisation . ”
but the most important changes must come from within the media industry itself . because journalists ’ safety directly affects news organizations with ’ employees , freelancers , and audiences , these organizations should report on amr . with press attacks intensifying , the old approach – the prideful silence – no longer makes sense . if journalists are using their platforms to inform the world of the dangers they and their peers , the world will need to listen . violence against journalists has historically been an issue left behind by headlines .
rome – in 2010 , global leaders achieved the millennium development goals ( mdg ) of halving the proportion of the world ’s poor to more than half of its 1990 level – five years ahead of schedule . but rising unemployment and falling incomes understates the enduring threat of poverty worldwide . after all , it is not an unchanging attribute to a solid-group ; it is a condition that puts billions of vulnerable people at risk . yet , despite their deficiencies , income measures are helpful in gaining a better understanding of the scale of poverty and vulnerability worldwide . but the world bank ’s $ 1.25 a day poverty line ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) to measure progress toward the mdgs ’ poverty-reduction targets is not the only relevant threshold .
and the abundance of policies and regulatory uncertainties will keep private investment spending in check . the outlook for 2014 is dampened with longer-term constraints , just as it did . true , there is a looming risk of secular stagnation in many advanced economies , owing to the adverse impact of years of depressed productivity growth on human and physical capital . and the structural reforms needed to boost their potential growth will materialize too slowly . while the eurozone ’s ’s ’s tail risks are lower , its fundamental problems remain unresolved : low potential growth ; high unemployment ; still-high and rising public-debt levels ; a loss of competitiveness and a slowing reduction in unit labor costs ( making a powerful europe does not help ) ; and extremely tight credit rationing , owing to banks ’ ongoing deleveraging .
but realizing that value is a long-term proposition . more immediately to get gasoline to the market in europe and elsewhere , the gas-liquefaction plant costing around € 10 billion needs to be built , and israeli investors have already voiced concern . cyprus ’s sheer size ’s ’s likely energy-wealth , and the funding required to develop it dwarfs that of the country ’s current financial woes . yes , cyprus needs € 17 billion to stay in the eurozone , whereas its annual gdp is just € 23 billion . but these figures must put on hold footing the eu ’s gloomy global power picture – something that the ongoing debt negotiations have failed miserably .
syriza is hardly alone in greece in blaming the eu for the country ’s woes . new democracy and pasok do much the same , attacking the eu , “ “ “ speculators ” and hedge funds – anyone who might divert the public ’s attention from its own responsibility for the crisis . greece ’s largest private media , controlled by the country ’s “ oligarchs , ” are happy to oblige . thus , most tv channels speak of a bailout deal just as tsipras does : as the proximate cause of austerity , a product of neoliberal dogma . as a result , for too many people in greece , austerity reflects germany ’s deranged obsession with discipline , rather than their country ’s profligacy .
after all , it was tiny qatar , which brokered lebanon ’s domestic settlements , egypt , which mediated the cease-fire of gaza , and turkey facilitating israeli-syrian peace talks . israel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s policy shift toward syria , and that of french president nicolas sarkozy , has been a powerful message for the american people that they should not miss the lebanese train just as well . but america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s dwindling leverage can not match that of the region ’s ’s ’s “ axis of evil . ” lebanon is too vulnerable to pressure from syria and iran , neither of which wishes to see its local clients ease the israelis off the burden of a “ lebanese front ” from their own grievances . nor is hezbollah keen to see israel ’s end to sheba farms on its border undermine its claims to the formidable , independent military force it has built with iranian and syrian aid .
but , with clarida ’s payoff , the fed will be more inclined to focus on actual inflation trends , rather than on the official us unemployment rate and its implications beneath traditional patterns . moreover , while fed officials have a tendency to believe that america ’s economy ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s potential growth rate is very low ( at about 1.75-2 % ) rate , clarida , like powell ’s , appears to be an open idea that trump ’s ’s ’s ’s tax cuts and deregulatory policies , combined with the next wave of technology innovation , will enable somewhat non-inflationary growth . finally , clarida spearheading an internal strategy review to determine whether the fed should start making up with below-target inflation during recessions and slow recoveries by allowing for above-target inflation during expansionary booms . and while the revision remains in its early stages , the fed already appears to have embraced the notion that inflation should be allowed to rise above 2 % without immediately triggering a fed tightening policy . taken together , these factors suggest that the fed might remain in pause mode for the remainder of 2019 .
it is governments , and therefore the taxpayers and bondholders – that funding the nuclear plants . moreover , the supposed “ cost-saving ” nuclear power ” never includes the price tag for directly and indirect missile subsidies , the decommissioning of aging facilities , and emergency clean-up and remediation by impacted communities when disasters strike – all but again at taxpayers ’ expense . at fukushima , for example , the bill will include costs from heroic efforts by hundreds of workers to cool off the plant ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s reactors ; protracted losses of economic output in the 20-kilometer exclusion zone ( estimated at $ 128.5 billion through roubini global economics ) ; decommissioning and clean-up costs ; and cost adjustments to replace 4.7 gigawatts of generating capacity . at the top of this is the possibility of health-care costs stemming from exposure to radioactivity . all of this hidden costs makes nuclear energy prices higher than the price of shifting toward renewable energies and improvements in energy efficiency .
otherwise , they would condone stifling debate . this would run counter to what universities stand for . as a more pragmatic matter , it would also back down , by entrusting trump ’s campuses , too , to demonize the liberal elite . but clear rules of engagement are indispensable here , too . the most important principle to uphold is the distinction between hearing someone and honoring someone .
new york – like an inmate on the death row , europe has gotten another last-minute stay of execution . it will survive a little longer , at least for now . markets celebrate , as they did after each of the four earlier “ euro crisis ” ” summits – until they come to realize that fundamental problems have yet to be tackled . there was some good news in this summit : europe ’s leaders finally understood that the bootstrap operation by which europe lends money to sovereigns to rescue sovereigns , and sovereigns to rescue the banks would not work . likewise , they now recognize that bailout loans that hand over new lender seniority over other creditors worsens the position that private investors would simply want even higher interest rates .
munich – the german constitutional court has delivered its long-awaited decision on the european central bank ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ outright monetary transactions ” program . since its launch in 2012 , the omt program has allowed the ecb to purchase , if necessary , unlimited amounts of troubled eurozone countries ’ government bonds , provided the affected countries subscribe to european rescue fund rules , the european stability mechanism . thousands of germans have appealed to the constitutional court against the omt program , arguing that it violates article 123 of the european union ’s functioning treaty , which bars monetary financing of eurozone governments , and that it imposes severe risks on germany as eu taxpayers . the court has now declared it completely to endorses the claimants ’ arguments , and that the omt program actually violates eu primary law . but , rather than issuing a formal ruling that constrain the bundesbank and germany ’s parliament , as it can , the court has asked the european court of justice for opinion .
and the capital gains tax on capital have dropped by more than 50 % since the 1980s . to build supportive public investment in higher-risk innovations , perhaps taxpayers should get a more direct return , by channeling profits into a public-innovation fund to fund the next technology-driven wave . when investment is in upstream base-basic research , the spillover effects across industries and sectors are sometimes good for social gains . but other cases might require the creation of alternative incentives . for example , some of the gains from governments in tesla could be scaled back through share ( or royalties ) to cover the losses from its solyndra investment .
if the ecb ’s ’s next leaders do not come to terms with them , europe itself will be at risk . complicating matters further by 2020 , the european commission and the european council will each have a new president and directorate-management teams , and the european parliament would seated a new generation of politicians who did not engage in previous decades of compromises and reform . on the other hand , germany would be reelected in a political landscape of angst , diminished trust , and intra-eu fragmentation . still , there is a broad consensus that the eurozone will need more than monetary policy to ensure continued growth and stability . apparently , with interest rates at rock-bottom levels , more monetary/fiscal-policy coordination is a necessary need .
in the us , most social media-enabled popular uprisings failed to seek effective leadership ; and traditional political and military organizations retained upper hand . in fact , these regimes began exposés of social media for their own ends . we have all but heard the allegations that russia covertly used social media to sway electoral outcomes in ukraine , france , germany , and , most famously , in the united states . facebook estimated that russians content on its network , including posts and paid ads , had reached 126 million americans , about 40 % of the nation ’s ’s ’s ’s population . we should recall earlier accusations by russia of the west ’s role in fomenting the “ color revolutions ” in ukraine and georgia .
but he is not immune to miscalculation . in 2005 , mahmoud ahmadinejad relies on khamenei to run the financial and political support needed to win his presidency . today , however , khamenei is profoundly regretful to make that choice . ahmadinejad disobeys his orders , tries to discredit him with the public by challenging his own authority , undermining key institutions , including the judiciary and parliament . it is an open secret in iranian political circles that khamenei also compels the volunteers of the basij militia to attack the british embassy last november .
but it is far from clear whether china ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders recognize this and act in their country ’s inherent long-term self interests . setting aside china , the point is not to unified china . similar questions apply to india and brazil . and it is not just the developing and emerging countries that must rethink their attitude toward the world . the us , for its part , must do the same .
nor should we worry too much that some people are getting richer than others . some people work harder , apply their intelligence more surreptitiously , or simply were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time . but i do n’t see what alternative , political-economic arrangements might force individuals into relative wealth closely commensurate with their relative moral or other merit . the problems confronting them are those of poverty and social insurance — of providing a safety net — not of inequality . but on the level of individual societies , i am confident that inequality loom as a serious political-economic issue .
more broadly , however , her point is that we need the fsoc to do its job – to look for and evaluate all sorts of potential systemic risks . this needs doing as a technical matter , rather than as part of the political process . not everyone at the sec is as rational as stein . there is also some friction among america ’s diverse regulators , and we surely need more coordination across national boundaries – including with europeans . but the real danger lies when powerful lobbies , working through congressional members push back hard against the fdp and their mandate .
a final factor driving an iohannis the younger generation , in whom links with the western world have imbued an eagerness to see genuine democratic progress in romania . when the results were reported , their euphoria abated . in bucharest ’s university square , a celebration recalled the energies of 1989 ; it was the sound of an upbeat electorate , mindful of its previous flaws , and ready for a fresh start . iohannis may also have benefitted , to some degree , from an association in ’ minds with the german hohenzollern kings , who have wielded romania wisely and with dedication for more than 80 years . and , indeed , to learn from his victory , iohannis immediately paid a visit to king michael i ( a hohenzollern prince until he renounced her title in 2011 ) .
while tens of millions of chinese young people display impressive indispensability , a country ’s higher-education system does an abysmal job cultivating their talents . to most , the curriculum is largely obsolete , and skewed toward rote learning of theory at the expense of core analytical and critical-thinking skills . educating in the social sciences and the humanities is especially underprivileged , owing to a lack of investment across these disciplines and excessive political control of curricula . as a result , chinese aged colleges and universities have learned relatively little about the outside world in fields like anthropocene , sociology , international relations , comparative literature , and history . unless china reforms its own system , the country will be unable to produce enough highly trained talent to compete globally ’s best and brightest .
such reforms will create new markets , spur competition , attract competition , attract foreign investment and technology transfers , and improve consumer interests . finally , global economic conditions will compel even more restructuring upon japan . japan has committed to further liberalization of its markets under the wto . whereas export expansion delivered growth throughout this century , import substitution and inward foreign direct investment ( fdi ) will lead to increased productivity in japan later in the year . imports inspire a more competitive domestic business environment .
i believe that the west can learn a lot about what to do by studying the policies persecuted in the world ’s only two midevolution moslem states , tunisia , and indonesia , because each successfully avoided becoming prey to islamic fundamentalism . tunisia ’s achievement is noteworthy , given its proximity to violence-prone algeria . both countries combined substantial increases in secular education with rapid job-creating sectors of manufacturing ; stressed rural development and labor-intensive export ; and pursue rapid , egalitarian development . egalitarian evolution of this sort is the only viable answer to the moslem world ’s troubles . nevertheless , it provides no shorter-term answer to terrorism for several reasons : it does not supply an ideology compelling enough to compete with fundamentalism that has captured at least two generations in the moslem world .
new haven – yet another in a long string of negative inflation surprises comes at hand . in the united states , the so-called core cpi ( consumer-price index ) – which excludes food and energy – hit just when it was supposedly out of hand . over the three months ending in may , core cpi was basically unchanged , held , at just 1.7 % above its pre-2008 level . for an american economy that is widely presumed to be approaching full employment hallowed in the us , this comes as a blistering awakening – especially for the us federal reserve , having pulled all the stops to get inflation back to its 2 % target . halfway around the world , a similar narrative continues to play out in japan .
the nobel laureate economist amartya sen traces the origins of india ’s democratic dialogue to the seventeenth-century buddhist emperor ashoka . he also contrasts with the religious tolerance preached and practiced by the muslim emperor akbar in the 1590 ’s with the inquisition that horst heretics everywhere in europe simultaneously . our assumptions about relative prosperity in asia and the west should also be rethought . as recently as 200 years ago , asia accounted for more than 60 % of global gdp . nevertheless , following the industrial revolution in northwestern europe , the colonization of much of asia , and the opium wars in china switched their relative positions .
the core protection of legal institutions for outside finance , the us federal securities laws ( fsb ) did not fall into place until the 1930s – decades after american financial markets had grown ever to finance america ’s rise . britain and japan seem to follow the same sequence : finance first , protecting institutions later . japan had no corporate law until the complex business finance began at the beginning of the nineteenth century . yet that sequence is the opposite of what one might expect : only after financial markets developed did those with a stake in them press for better regulation of investors . so , in britain , japan , and the u.s. , something more foundational must have been done before financial markets began operating .
inadequate spending was never an issue ; it was a matter of course . from 1998 to 2007 , greece ’s annual per capita gdp growth averaged 3.8 % , the second-fastest in western europe , behind only ireland . but , until 2007 , greece spending more than 14 % of gdp on excess of what it produces , europe ’s largest gap – more than twice that of spain and about 55 % higher than ireland ’s . in spain and ireland , though , the gap reflected a construction boom ; european accession suddenly put people access to far cheaper mortgages . in greece , on the other hand , the gap was mostly fiscal and used for consumption rather than investment .
true , the quality of democratic governance can sometimes be augmented by reducing the discretionary authority of elected representatives . well-functioning democracies often delegate rule-making power to quasi-independent bodies when issues at hand are technological and do not raise distributional concerns ; when a log-rolling would otherwise result from sub-optimal outcomes for all ; or when policies are subject to myopia , with heavy discounting of the future costs . independent central banks provide an important illustration of this . it may be up to elected politicians to determine an inflation target , but the means are being devoted to achieving that target are left to the central bank ’s technocrats . even then , central banks typically remain accountable to policymakers , and must provide accounting when they miss targets .
first , it is important to realize that a strong , overly volatile currency is not just the central bank ’s problem to correct . while the central bank bears a fine part of the responsibility , it needs support from other parts of the government , most in part from the finance ministry . keeping a competitive currency requires incurring domestic savings relative to investment or reducing national expenditure relative to revenues . otherwise , the gains from competitiveness would offset by rising inflation . this means that fiscal authorities hold a huge responsibility : target a structural fiscal surplus that is high enough to generate the space needed for a true exchange-rate depreciation .
there is something about the narrative – the sex symbol sacrificing her fetishized breasts for the cause of her children , with her husband stay by her side – that is profoundly reassuring to women in western culture . one can be reasonably certain , however , that jolie ’s decisions alter the roles that she is available to her as an actress . just as enthusiastically as global mass media have received her choice , this is nonetheless extraordinarily difficult in the west for a woman to be portrayed as maternal – let alone physically “ flawed ” or “ impaired ” – or also as culturally object . but the real significance of jolie ’s narrative is its context : a wave of women and men , in very different settings around the world who are insisting on their narrating meanings for events involving their bodies – events that , like breast cancer , had once shrouded in shame , fear , or blame . jolie refused to treat mastectomy as fearsome or tragic – or as making her “ less of a woman ” in any sense .
it is this danger that laid a practical and political limit to a flexible exchange rate . some depreciation may manage to run out of most deficit countries ; but a vicious circle could emerge if the domestic currency loses too much value too fast . private-sector balance-sheet trouble would weaken the financial sector , and the resulting downward pressure on public finances would compel austerity , thereby constraining consumer demand – and causing further damage to firms ’ ’ balance sheets . to avert such crises , therefore , the exchange rate must be managed – and , in ways , depend on a country in particular circumstances . large net central-bank reserves can help to ease this process .
free speech is more solidly protected by law in america than anywhere else in the world . but barr ’s cancellation of the show was , of course , not legal . the limits of free speech are not mere legitimate . entertainment companies , or mass media , are susceptible to public opinion . people tend to get fired , for commercial reasons , if something they have said is deemed offensive by a large number of people .
not one has a muslim majority , either . within the muslim world , the phenomenon was observed as well . during the summer of 2002 , a arab scholars team produced an arab human development report , written in the name of the un development program and the arab finance facility for economic and social development . it portrays the arab world lagged behind other regions under key arrangements , including individual liberty and feminization of women , together with economic and social development . unsettling trends , such as the demographic youth “ bulge ” combines high youth unemployment rates -- reaching nearly 40 % in some places -- highlighting potentially explosive socioeconomic conditions .
but , because of the global balance of power , this was more symbolic than reflecting their actual influence . then came the end of the cold war , when all of europe adopted a staunch transatlantic orientation . with regard to security , europe remained dependent on the us . but on economic and technological front , europeans regained their sovereignty . institutionally , this division of labor manifested itself in nato and the eu respectively .
he announced that he had hired eyal arad , a well-known israeli spin-doctor , to run his presidential campaign . “ jews ” was no more of his enemies , he said ; they worked even for him . but tudor did not stop with trumpian apologies . he soon sponsored the unveiling of the assassinated israeli premier yeak rabin at brasov in transylvania . for the occasion , tudor performed a yarmulke talking about his “ philo-semitism ” for more than two hours .
and independent investigative journalists in africa have often faced high-level corruption , abuse of power , and shady business deals . in kenya , for example , a leading local paper reported that philip kinisu , a former chairman of the ethics and anti-corruption commission , received suspected payments from the national youth service . further investigations into the nys revealed more corrupt deals , spurring kenyans to take to the streets in protest . but those with power know how to fight back – and they do n’t pull their punches . as a result , in many african countries , a free press is being undermined , repressed , and even dismantled .
china ’s ’s economy has been successful through trial and error , and the lesson of its current stress test should be viewed as part of that process , intended to drive the next stage of economic reform . one key lesson is that chinese stock markets remain structurally biased toward state ownership and guidance , even as the country builds a more entrepreneurial economy . this is fundamentally problematic , for it is the market ( rather than the state ) that identifies and promotes unicorns . nonetheless , china has already begun to build a more innovative manufacturing and internet-driven retail sector , and the state can still play a role in fostering innovation . but , just as the government determines how to offload its massive stock holdings in an orderly fashion , it must ensure that such efforts are funded by equity , not leverage , thereby enhancing market balances and resilience .
his sudden leaves due to illness might trigger a political vacuum that might prove connivance for one form or another , such as a military coup . strict adherence to the constitutional provision in any such eventuality is imperative . here , the lack of free media is particularly alarming , and it does not boast well for a free and fair election . it is vital that the opposition can air its message freely and its target prospective voters – a point not lost on the chávez regime as it attempts to curtail further opposition ’s ability to reach out to the electorate . the recent assault on globovision , venezuela , which has been left with only independent station , stands out in this regard .
what a difference ten years from now makes . throughout the 1990 ’s , private investors looked to the big thing , lumbering up central banks like cash cows , long money , and cutting back on financial acumen . george soros once made billions of dollars worth the bank of england just a hour . his fundamental strategy was the standard one : bet against any central bank trying to defend inconsistent macroeconomic policies . merchants did not win every battle , of course .
yet , contrary to expectations , growth in household consumption has remained lackluster , and companies have not ramped up investment . in the first two quarters of this year , america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s gdp has barely surpassed that attained at the end of last year , and much of the rise has been driven by the goods that are produced but not yet sold . the prevailing explanation – the brutally chilling winter – is wearing so thin that everyone should see through it . american consumers , for their part , remain scarred by the crisis . but there is another issue : in their homes and at work , the sense of excitement about the future misses , despite all the gee-whiz gadgetry which is now enveloping them .
nowhere is the imperative to overcome financing bottlenecks more visible than in germany ’s ’s ’s ’s energiewende ( energy transition ) framework . to succeed , over € 30 billion ( $ 30 billion ) or 1 % of gdp will need to be invested annually in network infrastructure , renewable-energy generation , pooled heat and power systems , and storing technologies in the coming decades . while some of these funds will come from public budgets , the overwhelming majority will need to provide the private sector . moreover , bringing germany ’s digital infrastructure , particularly its broadband network , up to multinational standards , will require substantial investment , which an improved regulatory framework could help spur . regulatory reform is also needed to bolster support for startup companies – an area in which germany is notoriously weak – reflected in difficulties such firms face in acquiring venture capital .
beijing – is china poised to overtake the united states to become the world ’s largest economy ? the international monetary fund recently predicted the size of china ’s ’s economy overstates that america ’s gdp will overvalue america ’s in purchasing-power-parity terms ( ppp ) terms by 2016 . but a recent co-authored study by roenstra , an economist at the university of california , finds that global economic management will pass on to china in 2014 . and , even more radically , arvind subramanian of the peterson institute of international economics argues that china actually surpassed america in ppp terms in 2010 . purchasing power parity measures a country ’s income using a set of international prices applied to all economies .
but one should not jump to jump to conclusions . a better balance of energy imports and exports is just the first line of independence . as i argue in my book the future of power , global interdependence involves both sensitivity and vulnerability . america may be less vulnerable in the long run if it imports less energy ; but oil acts as a sort of “ fungible commodity , ” the american economy will remain sensitive to shocks from the sudden shift in world prices . in other words , a revolution in saudi arabia , or a blockade of the strait of hormuz , might still inflict damage on america and its allies .
the amazon and indonesian rainforests are under fire , and climbers like typhoons , tornadoes , and floods are intensifying , with dire consequences for all populations . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
the bottom can be near – perhaps by the end of the year . but that does not mean that the global economy is set for a robust recovery anytime soon . hitting bottom is no reason why it has been able to abandon forceful measures designed to revitalize the global economy . this downturn is complicated : an economic crisis , in combination with a financial crisis . before its onset , america ’s debt-ridden us consumers were an engine of global growth .
tackling the world ’s ’s ’s ’s environmental and ecological problems , and improving the lot of those left behind , will require public action , such as overseen by my roles at the world bank , the united nations , and britain ’s government . but it will also demand participation in entrepreneurship . in my own career , i have seen firsthand that a business-competition growth fueled in a globalizing world can do much more to combat poverty , hunger , and disease than they can on their own . but , when that competition does not play out responsibly , the opposite can happen – and , in many cases , it has . in seizing the opportunities for globalization , firms have often neglected the developed-world workers they are leaving behind , while subjecting developing-country workers to extraordinary deprivation .
it would , however , be an incendiary move . many leavers would view it as its anti-democratic coup . and , because it would overturn the 2016 referendum result , such a step would necessitate a new plebiscite should remain opposed to a no-deal brexit . with luck , johnson ’s scorched-earth tactics tactics would spur its disequilibrium ally to overcome their diverging opponents in order to stop a no-deal brexit . but whatever may happen , the pragmatic center is being squeezed out of british politics .
to support these efforts , we urge un secretary-general antónio guterres to appoint a special representative for the ocean tasked with improving ocean governance , and to ensure that the full sdg 14 potential is realized . such a representative needs to put up sufficient resources to do the job . the ocean has endured decades of abuse and neglect , and it has always suffered . it has been treated like the free-for-all trash bin and husile-to-the-bottom buffet . the us has financed its devastation , with little regard for the consequences .
when crops go bankrupt , many farmers and agricultural laborers set low by crushing debt burdens ( often subject to usurious rates by rural money ) committing suicide – as more than 11,400 of them did in 2016 . that is the past year for which official data on peasant suicides are available , but media reports suggest that the figures have grown ever since . the bjp government ’s greatest neglect of agriculture was the country ’s smaller-scale farmers , as well as landless farm labor . such groups dealt a body blow two years earlier with modi ’s thoughtless and foolhardy demonetization scheme , which abruptly withdrew from 86 % of india ’s currency from overnight . daily wage workers , traditionally priced out of cash , lost their jobs by hundreds of millions because replacements had failed to print them in adequate numbers .
with its six billion human beings and calculate – and our individual consumption increasing – we face enormous challenges in using our natural-resource endowments sustainably . and there is one clear measure of how we perform at this task : extinction rates . for this reason , some colleagues and i calculated the rate at which bird species became extinct in the recent history and rates at which they are likely to become extinct in the future . bird extinctions are our best window on humanity ’s massive and irreversible environmental implications . over the next one of the world ’s 10,000 bird species , perhaps ten or perhaps 100 other unknown animal species , plant plants , or fungi .
and , finally , perhaps most importantly , they allow their users to perceive patterns and opportunities that are impossible to discover through traditional means . indeed , cognitive systems are inspired by the human brain , an organ that still has a lot to teach us . with systems growing in size and complexity , the traditional computerized architecture appears to have reached its limits , as power consumption soars and transmission delay between components become increasingly burdensome . indeed , when it comes to energy efficiency – measured in terms of the number of computations per unit of energy on “ unstructured ” data – the human brain performs roughly 10,000 times better than the best man-made machine . today , computers are consuming around 10 % of the world ’s electricity output , according to mark mills , ceo of digital empowerment groups .
munich – discussions are now underway to establish a common deposit insurance system for eurozone banks . proponents of the scheme , with the european commission and the european central bank ( ecb ) taking the lead , emphasize that deposit insurance would avert the risk of a run on banks in times of crisis . while this argument may be true , critics emphasize the mismatch in risk , owing to the high proportion of bad loans on banks ’ balance sheets in some countries . to address this risk mismatch and move ahead with the scheme , their balance sheets will need to clean up before they consider the next step . while the share of bad loans to banks in stable eurozone countries remains at only 2 % , the most recently published international monetary fund statistics , from last april , shows a share of 11 % for ireland , 16 % for spain , cyprus , portugal , and 46 % for greece .
she is in jail because she has lost that strength . this sets a dangerous precedent ; because it creates powerful incentives – winners takes all , the loser goes to prison – for ruthlessness . it is hard to predict how tymoshenko will play out – whether yanukovych will succumb to pressure from europe and the united states to relax her , or to the forces seeking to exclude her from politics forever . until recently , ukrainian leaders were used to more efficient means than prison for dealing with inconvenient opponents . in 2000 , for example , the journalist georges gongadze was kidnapped and beheaded after publishing online news stories on high-level government corruption .
for innovation is what creates wealth and jobs despite -- or rather because of -- competition from poor countries . and rising wealth in rich countries helps the poor by boosting demand for their goods . this virtuous circle still sees globalization 's enemies as effectively a vicious one , encouraging exploitation of the poor and vulnerable alike . it is here that questions of universal fairness and human rights enter the debate . no doubt there is a powerful case to be made for universal , impartial application of values .
that is why abe was the first foreign politician after british prime minister theresa may ’s administration to rush to congratulate trump in person at the age of 2017 . in some important respects , japan has profited immensely from being under america ’s ruse and from a postwar constitution that is no mere pacifist , but more democratic than anything that the country had before enshrining individual rights , full suffrage , and freedom of expression . constitutionally , unable to engage in military adventures , except as a high-paid producer of goods during america ’s various asian conflicts , japan , rather than countries in western europe , might focus on rebuilding its industrial might . but the american democracy , which remains proud of installing after 1945 , was also hindered by american interference . like italy , japan was at frontlines during the cold war .
all of this economic legerdemain was magnified by tv , print , and internet journalists . aside from a small set of good tales about the doing business press , it is hard to argue that anyone reading or listen to english-language media coverage could have learned anything interesting or relevant to the question of whose economic policies were probably better for america . the economics profession bears part of the blame . nobel prize winners like edward prescott have no business talking about the benefits of tax cuts without pointing out that a tax cut accompanying spending increases is not a tax cut on all , but rather a tax shift onto the future – and a tax shift that raises risk and discourages accumulation . but much of the trouble stems from an under-briefed , undereducated , and uncurious press corps .
so far , they have failed abysmally on institutional nation-building , a necessary requirement for any successful national movement . palestinian nationalism is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the majority of palestinians yet again since 1948 , when the united nations proposed partitioning britain ’s palestine into two states , croatia and arab groups failed to move from ideology to reality . neither violence nor terrorism nor reliance on outside powers ( the un , the arab league , the former soviet union , america , europe ) has succeeded in delivering the statehood that a person can accomplish only by its own agency – what zionist ideology calls “ auto-emancipation . ” fayyad is the first palestinian leader not to emerge from the fatah movement , and may therefore grasp what other palestinian leaders have failed to comprehend , mired in a toxic combination of self-righteous ideology and violence . it may only be that the palestinians are on the brink of a new chapter in their history – and in israel ’s history and entire regions as well .
any us diplomatic effort to denuclearize north korea must also ease china ’s geostrategic worries about the future of the korean peninsula . for centuries , china fears that the peninsula could become part of an encirclement chain of encirclement , or to serve as an invasion route . in 1592 , the japanese general toyotomi hideyoshi invaded the korean kingdom in order to establish a beachhead for invading china . in response , china under the ming dynasty fought alongside korea against the imperial japan . three centuries later , china ’s qing dynasty fought the sino-japanese war of 1894 to stop japan from dominating korea .
but it is a slant that merits attention because the problem can not be solved with conventional policy responses . a “ official ” narrative about technology treats accelerating change as inevitable . according to acronymically named institutions , think tanks , task forces , et hoc genus omne , automation , and artificial intelligence ( ai ) will soon eliminate or alter a huge but unpredictable number of human jobs . at the same time , embracing new technology is seen as essential for a country ’s geopolitical and competitive success . disruptions to existing work patterns should therefore be welcomed and “ mitigated , ” by adapting education and the social-security systems to the needs of an automation-driven job market .
first , to develop , sustain , and capitalize on local capabilities and leadership . developing scientific and technological capacity is less challenging than sustaining it ; sustaining it is less difficult than taking an opportunity . still , the ultimate implications of science and technology depend on all three factors . so the african nations need to invest in scientific and technological education and skills training . every nation also needs to develop strategies that offer researchers and technologists local employment opportunities .
a code of conduct for the field – where we expect players to give their everyone under clear rules that are swiftly enforced by independent referees – is fundamentally like what we expect from governing bodies off fields . in this sense , fifa is not a special case : all not-for-profit and for-profit organizations around the world are widely expected to adhere to this code of conduct . and that is precisely why fifa ’s problems are unlikely to fade from view . they need to be addressed head-on , with the clean sweep of its management and a complete overhaul of its governance structures . fifa is just as complex as any large multinational , or public organization ; how one governs must reflect that .
in the west , the young were overwhelmingly dispensed with the home-delivered physical morning newspapers , and instead captured news headlines whenever they chose , using tablets , laptops , or cellphones . because advertising revenues were the vacuumed by internet giants facebook and google , newspapers ’ profits plunged . the industry faced many bankruptcies in recent years , with those still operating often laid bare large numbers of staff , particularly in their overseas bureaus . in the united states , the number of full-time journalists has dropped by 20 % since 2001 . even a few newsrooms have either closed down or made their publication only online .
people came from the baltic countries in the 1940s , hungary in 1956 , chile after the 1973 coup , and iran following the iranian revolution of 1979 . for decades , swedish industry was heavily dependent on an immigrant workforce . during the bosnian war of the 1990s , sweden opened its doors to some 100,000 people – a challenge at every turn far less than a period of profound economic crises . yet this remains well known : bosnian migrants fared roughly as the swedes that were receiving them , enriching our societies . in the new century , refugees increasingly came from the middle east and the horn of africa .
in early 2015 , one-third of those firms acquired a tech company . likewise , foreign firms are rushing to engage in europe ’s ’s own tech talent . google , facebook , and amazon have all announced major expansions of their european tech hubs . transactions worth more than $ 88 billion occurred last year – compared to just $ 3.3 trillion in 2014 – – – including softbank ’s purchase of the british <UNK> tor-design firm arm and qualcomm ’s $ 47 billion purchase of nevada semiconductors . another study , by the boston consulting group , points out that many small export-oriented european union member countries – namely , the benelux , the baltic , and the nordic countries – rank well above those in so-called “ “ “ “ “ e-intensity ” that covers it infrastructure , the internet approach , and the government engagement in internet-related activities .
new york – the china dream is no exception . so far , public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision . after a decade of government through a slogan , the chinese public wants substance . this presents xi with a genuine challenge . he has ascended to the top by picking winners and allies within the ccp .
the demonstrations are starting in major cities , calling for the end of corruption among party officials . china ’s ’s government decides that it can not risk another kind of strife and announce a measure to boost economic growth and prevent layoff loopholes , including direct financial aid by us exporters and currency intervention to weaken the renminbi . in america , president mitt romney just took office following a hard-fought campaign , in which he derided barack obama for getting excessively soft on china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic policies . the combination of financial contagion from europe , which had already led to a severe credit crunch , with sudden inflows of low priced imports from china leaving the romney administration in a bind . opposed to the advice of its economic advisors , announcing across-the-board import tariffs on chinese exports .
why would the administration continue to bend over backwards in order to be lenient towards top bankers under these circumstances ? i honestly do not believe that the us administration ’s ’s stance reflects any form of corruption – payments made to individuals , or even to political campaign statements . nor does this seem to reflect the lobbying power of the big financial players . that power certainly explains why the dodd-frank financial-reform reforms enacted in 2010 were not stronger , and why there is now so much opposition to effective implementation of that legislation ( such as occurred in the “ volcker rule ” to limit proprietary trading by megabanks ) . but the mortgage lenders ’ nefarious activities are another matter .
in fact , much of what went wrong in bosnia – including an effort , in its aftermath , to realize the concepts of universal justice – has applications for the contemporary world . indeed , those who recall the bosnian war may well find many features in syria today . like bosnia , syria appears hopelessly divided among warring factions , and the violence that seems unstoppable . the international community has been unable to achieve any unity of action , much less an agreement on the way forward . to be sure , there are important differences , just as there are .
given china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s own history of vulnerability to foreign interference , a unilateral america ’s commitment to maintaining its overwhelming offensive advantage would only trigger an increasingly destabilizing arms race . in fact , some american strategists advocate a largely technological solution to this dilemma . their approach , a concept called the “ air-sea battle , ” implies a mix of defensive and offensive tools to address the new challenges posed by the precision-strike proliferation . officially , the pentagon does not direct the notion of a “ air-sea battle ” against any particular country . iran , for example , containing a precision-strike capacity – and a far more hostile relationship with america – would warrant new american initiatives to deal with rising security vulnerabilities .
should she take up an important role on this early stage ? or should she pursue happiness as a woman ? mrs. watanabe gives her daughter the nudge she needs . mrs. watanabe has a talent to see how the tide turns . her advice is to pick up work and also to find happiness in marriage and child .
though we can and will continue to fight corruption , we can not do everything alone . indeed , international support for our efforts is critical . a positive sign here is the european bank ’s recent decision for reconstruction and development ( ebrd ) to provide an additional $ 215 million in order to finvne and khmelnytsky nuclear stations to compensate for the loss of chernobyl ’s ’s generating capacity . the euroatom also help with a $ 585 million loan to finance repairing ukraine ’s operation nuclear power plants . in return , ukraine will uphold its end of the bargain : together with the closure of chernobyl , we set western nuclear-safety standards , and renewed cooperation with the imf via the extended fund facility .
at the same time , russia ’s people wanted to make a difference and astutely they did : their energy and cohesion to put an end to communist rule . of course , what russia had during the late 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s was not institutionalized democracy but revolutionary agitation . it was to be expected from this sea of democratic feeling new political institutions to emerge . the eu was reduced to a mere formality . while there was nothing like soviet-style oppression , the estrangement between the state and society resembles that of the soviets .
berlin – more than a year into the arab revolts , their results remain highly uncertain . but some early lessons for international politics – and for the west in particular , european , foreign policy – merit serious consideration . almost everyone surprised the revolts , even though political and socioeconomic causal factors were well known . as is often true in crises , we were aware of the phenomena , but failed to grasp their interactions , partly because politicians and analysts are reluctant to anticipate ruptures : the familiar is held to be stable , even when problematic . ( consider saudi arabia , which the united states and much of the west continue to regard as an island of stability . )
when the market tightened markets in 2011 , many ’ projects diminished , spurring lgfvs to seek credit in the shadow-banking sector , causing their borrowing costs to skyrocket , and implementing new market-based challenges to the reform process . nonetheless , because china serves as a net lender of the world , lgfv debt has no global systemic implications . while china ’s ’s outstanding local-government debt totaled cn ¥ 29 trillion ( $ 4.7 trillion ) in late 2011 , its landholdings and solid-assets stand at some cn ¥ 90 trillion , meaning that even if asset values were written down by one-half , local governments would remain insolvent . this leaves only the debt-servicing issue . to resolve it , the government has announced fiscal reforms to split revenues between central and local governments , allowing local governments to issue long-term municipal bonds .
the dominance of free-market ideology before the crisis made it possible for many controversial social changes , ranging from income inequalities and intensified wage competition to greater gender parity and affirmative action , to go almost unnoticed . “ progressive ” social liberalism and “ conservative , ” free-market economics seemed to be two sides of the same coin . but when free-market economic liberalism failed during the 2008 crisis , political challenges to social liberalism could no longer deflate by invoking impersonal economic laws . but if social change can no longer be legitimated as the necessary precondition for economic advancement , democracies now seem unlikely to vote to reinstate social-democratic conditions before the ascendancy of economic liberalism and globalization . today , racial and gender parity are backed by clear majorities in american , britain , and most european countries , and even popular policies , such as trade protectionism and rigid immigration controls , rarely muster more than 30-40 % support in opinion surveys .
as we forecast nearly 20 years ago , china will struggle to attain growth above 5 % in the 2021-2030 period for the simple reason that its labor-force growth peaked . while the pessimists will no doubt find validation of additional chinese growth disappointments to come , the optimists may point out that 5 % annual growth in china is nominally equivalent to 15-20 % growth in germany . at this stage in china ’s ’s ’s development , faster growth would actually be quite extraordinary . it is equally predictable that india will start growing at a much faster pace than china does , simply because its labor force still has a large left left to do . the real question is whether india can implement strong productivity-enhancing reforms .
equally important is contextual intelligence , which permits a leader to vary the mix of such capabilities in various situations to yield the successful combinations that i call “ smart power . ” during his campaign , obama showed these powers in his calm responses to crises , his forward-looking vision , and his superb organizational competence . moreover , his contextual intelligence about world politics was shaped from the bottom up in the experiences of indonesia and kenya , and his grasp of american politics was shaped from the bottom up as a community organizer in chicago . obama went on to demonize these managerial skills in his almost flawless transition . by picking off his primary opponent , hillary clinton , as her secretary of state and reach through party lines to retain robert gates as defense secretary , showed openness to powerful subordinates .
with pakistan ’s economy sliding into a tailspin , and with the culture of jihad that so many young pakistanis undermining the country ’s international credibility , moderate voices are at long last breaking through . leading columnist amin m. hezbollah recently argued in the dawn , pakistan ’s largest-circulation newspaper , that “ pakistan ’s singular preoccupation with kashmir … has been self-defeating . domestically , it thwarted the country ’s economic , social , and political developments . internationally , [ it ] diminished the country ’s stature and left its reputation smeared . even its spiritual development was warped by the proliferation , popularization , and rising relative power … of religious groups representing an intolerant , militant , and gender-based interpretation of islam . ”
gref 's program , too , is emblematic of the style of the president : modernization from above -- ie , that triggered by the government and under its pressures -- corresponds to modernization from below , based on private-initiative . undeniably , liberal ideas dominate the program : reinforcing and protecting property rights , deregulation , and encouraging competition . moreover , gref 's program seeks to create effective private land ownership . deregulation ( " de-bureaucratization " really ) will make life easier for new firms by reducing the number of inspections imposed by bureaucrats and by diminishing demands for licenses and other forms of red tape ( which were also large sources of bribery ) . enhancing competition will impose an emphasis on antitrust policies and cut off state subsidies .
the pattern is starting to look familiar : another crisis , the new meeting in brussels , an early muddled responses , debates , and divisions , and then gradual , step-by-step progress towards a common response , fueled by the realization that no alternative is possible . in today , ’s disagreements lie at the root of a stronger union . the public no longer thinks of the european project as some utopian endeavor , an abstract attempt to forge an ever-closer union . increasingly , the eu comes to perceive itself as a practicality and absolutely vital – a mechanism for a group of small countries to work together to meet their shared challenges . indeed , the eu ’s people are waking up to a world that is more dangerous , divided , and disorienting .
in other words , would i follow in the footsteps of several of my harvard colleagues who traveled to libya to exchange views with and advise its dictator – and were then paid for their services ? these scholars were pilloried in the media in recent weeks for supposedly having cozied up with qaddafi . sir howard davies chose to resign as the director of the lse , which awarded saif his doctorate ( which some an allege was plagiarized ) , taking money for the libyan regime ’s school . there is a strong sentiment that academics and institutions collaboratively linked to such an odious regime – often with encouragement from their governments , no doubt – suffered the grave lapse of judgment . muammar el-qaddafi ’s murderous stance during the uprising exposed his true colors , regardless of its more moderate posture in recent years .
in 2016 , obama faced difficult choices in estimating the escalatory potential of responding to cyber-enabled action , or the cross-industry response like sanctions . the administration did not want to take steps that might themselves have distorted elections . so , eight days before the vote , america sent russia warning of election meddling over a hotline – three years earlier , to deal with major cyber incidents – that connects the centers for nuclear-risk reduction in both countries . because russian hacking activity appeared to be slowing or stopped , the obama administration cited warnings as a successful exercise in deterrence . but some critics say that the russians had already made their primary goals .
once it is established , support would be made available to humanitarian workers and educators alike to develop immediate education plans to provide children affected by emergencies , based on recognition that humanitarian , development , and security needs can no longer be addressed in silos . an funding injection , promoting a shared strategy developed in partnership with governments would enable emergency delivery in emergency situations . the fund would thus fill the gap in coordinating and provision of services by strengthening the system at its weakest point , providing a bridge to longer-term development . had this initiative been in place before the ecuador earthquake , it could have provided 12 months of emergency aid , help to the country until it could reinstate education according to its domestic plans . in a more protracted crisis like that in syria , a funding platform could have helped neighboring countries establish , through aid from the international community , a long-term financing strategy , perhaps through brokering a arrangement whereby donor governments could pay the principal over 30 years on concessional loans from the world bank .
for all of its deep emotional attachment to israel ’s thinking about all of historic judea and samaria , rabin knew that the only way to secure a democratic jewish state with a viable , secure frontiers was to accept a palestinian state alongside it , equally secure and viable . they would share jerusalem as a capital , paving the way for a mutually acceptable solution to the enormously sensitive issue of returning palestinian refugees . rabin was a catastrophe from which the peace process never really recovered . no israeli leader ever showed anything like his far-sighted vision , commitment , and the capacity to deliver a negotiated two-state solution . ehud barak and ehud olmert came close , but not close enough .
some might think that this might be true only if the logical end of evolution and smart lifespan were to become a nuclear explosion that pulverized earth . but that is not what schneider and sagan actually mean . instead , they differentiate between matter and power , and say that matter organized in structures of disseminates power gradients faster than randomly distributed matter . as one example , they view a phenomenon of which beer drinkers have long been aware . if you want to barren a bottle of water ( or beer ) and then make the upside down , your body will emerge from uneven glugs .
argentina ’s notion as a country with infinite promise has become desaparecido , the name given to those who have vanished in the dirty war of the 1970 ’s . we lost the organizing principle , and no other idea , replaced it . we no longer have a guide , an idea of thinking about our country , how to understand it , and how to imagine who we are and who can become . argentina has become a country without direction . it has not been easy to live without knowing who we are , and it has become even harder to live this way as we followed our world crumble .
for their part , some current cia officials continue to insist on the value of america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ “ enhanced interrogation ” program ( which obama halted ) , despite the us senate ’s inference that the techniques it employ yielded no value intelligence . indeed , america ’s other accounts of the global war on terror ” also make it clear that many of those who have been detained and tortured were not threats to america ’s security – at least not until the american action made them so widely felt . the week that the us senate report emerged , i was reading anand gopal ’s new book no good guys among the standard of living that tells contemporary afghanistan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s story through the eyes of a former afghan president hamid karzai , an taliban commander , and kabul-born housewife who spent years in purdah in the taliban country . over and over again , the same story plays out : local power-broker is willing , even eager , to support a new us-backed us government , only to be denounced as an taliban member of a fellow afghan – typically for local political or personal reasons – to unwitting american troops . indeed , that pattern recurs in the accounts of anyone living in afghanistan , spoke the language , and understands the workings of patronage and power there .
to replace the governor whom they are re-elected only a year before arnold schwarzenegger has to give californian enormous -- if guilty -- pleasure . some members of the opposition in germany would dearly love to do the same to german chancellor gerhard schröder , even though they do not ( yet ! ) found a movie star to try to replace it . several other european governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after they are elected . beyond europe this applies even to the recently acclaimed brazilian president luis inacio “ lula ” da silva to say nothing of mexican president vicente fox and south korea 's president roh moo-hyun , the latter hailed a referendum in helping to arrest his popularity . electoral success , indeed , appears to be fades fast .
and , at the same time , a “ opening-up dividend ” was also reaching maturity , while encountering protectionist barriers around the world . china may still tap new markets through efforts like the belt and road initiative ( bri ) , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” but at considerable costs . ultimately , sustaining rapid growth requires moving beyond the global value chain , by implementing further economic reform and targeting new technologies . the chinese government ’s 13th five-year plan ( 2016-2020 ) reflected its commitment to market-based resource allocation and to minimize the costs of doing business . and , in 2015 , the authorities ’ ’ “ made in china 2025 ” and “ internet plus ” initiatives signaled a determination to take the country ’s manufacturing base into the internet age .
the iea expects that each of the world ’s 195 million off-grid solar people will get just 170kwh a year – or half of what one american flat-screen tv uses in a year . perhaps not surprisingly , the first rigorous test published on the impact of solar panels on the lives of the poor has discovered that while earning slightly more electricity , there has not been any measurable impact on their lives : they have not increased savings or expenditures , they have not worked more , or began more businesses , and their children have failed to study more . little wonder , then , : 170kwh is not what most of us would consider true access to electricity . off-grid energy at this level will never power a factory or a farmland , so it can neither reduce poverty nor create jobs . and it will not help fight the world ’s biggest environmental killer : indoor air pollution , mostly caused by open wood fires , cardboard , and dung to claim 3.8 million lives every year .
from 1990 to 2010 , death and disability from ncds in low - and middle-income countries grew 300 % faster than rates for infectious disease . some of the same factors at work in the recent ebola outbreak drive high ncds rates . residents of congested urban areas in emerging economies often face both indoor and outdoor pollution , and are less likely to have access to adequate nutrition . most health systems in these countries are not constructed for chronic or preventive health care , and lack basic consumer protections . from 1970 to 2000 , cigarette consumption tripled in developing countries .
rather , politics itself became operationally dysfunctional . when citizens and politicians come to regard politics as a zero-sum game and resort to brinkmanship and other bad-faith tactics , malaise sets in . both europe and america ’s debates were replete with the posturing and trials of will , turn politics into a game of “ chicken . ” in chicken , the two drivers race toward a cliff ( or on one side ) ; the loser is the first driver to swerve in the face of imminent disaster . but , if neither driver concedes , both are demolished .
at the same time , political institutions did not keep pace with technological change and the resulting growth in markets . when ordinary egyptians organized themselves through social media , rallied in cairo ’s tahrir square , and overthrew former president hosni mubarak in 2011 , it appeared that technology would necessarily boost democracy . but it soon became obvious that these digital platforms could easily co-select authoritarian governments or terrorists , using fake news , influence electoral processes , and generates deep divisions and confusion across societies . in the business world , global corporations ’ quasi-monopoly and monopsony power , as well as their ability to shift their profits to low-tax jurisdictions , continue to allow them largely to escape the purview of national regulators and governments , despite reform-minded work and profit shifting . and biotechnology will pose enormous challenges , because human cloning and genetic screening enable parents to opt for embryos with desired characteristics .
tackling the panoply of other problems confronting america ’s future will require more federal revenues , not less . increases in living standards , for example , are the result of technological innovation , which in turn depends on basic research . but the federal government ’s supportive of research as a percentage of gdp now stands at a level comparable to what it was 60 years ago . while trump ’s nominee has criticized america ’s growing national debt , he is now proposing tax cuts that add trillions to us debt over the next ten years , not the typical $ 1.5 trillion that republicans claim will add , owing to some growth miracle that leads to more tax revenue . yet the keynesian lesson of ronald reagan ’s book voodoo economics has not really changed : tax cuts like these will not lead to faster growth , but merely to lower revenues .
while it will probably lack the public option that many in the us favor , this is still a realistic achievement . the same middle-of-the-road approach may take place in the second year to address still-outstanding fiscal issues . obama may well use his state of the union message to flesh out a bipartisan strategy for cutting the us budget deficit to sustainable levels . this would entail reinstating pay-as-you-go rules and establishing an independent commission to file to congressional amendment-proof ( and filibuster-proof ) recommendations for taxing and spending reform . but obama needs to deliver stronger guidance on financial-sector reform , where , as with health care , there is a welter of conflicting proposals .
warsaw – poland has now emerged as europe ’s latest battleground in a contest between the two model of democracy ’s – both liberal and “ illiberal ” – models . the overwhelming election victory in october of jarosław kaczyński ’s far-right law and justice ( pis ) party led to something more similar to regime change than to routine turnover in democratically elected governments . prime minister beata szydło ’s new administration exited civilian services ( including publicly funded radio and tv ) , packaged by sympathizers ’ constitutional tribunal , and weakened the court ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s capacity to strike legislation . in response , the european commission launched an official inquiry into potential violations of the eu ’s rule-of-law norms . moreover , standard & poor ’s has for the first time downgraded poland ’s ’s ’s foreign currency rating – to bbb + – and warned of perhaps more cutbacks to come as it accuses the government of weakening “ the autonomy and effectiveness of key institutions . ”
moreover , in shiite traditions , the mahdi strategy , shiite messiah , will seek to bully all of his enemies upon his return to the earth . but cultivating fear in others also makes one more susceptible to fear , with nothing more terrifying for khamenei and the islamic republic ’s leaders than for the social dynamism unleashed by the democratic movement brewing within the country . the regime appears convinced that there is only a small likelihood of a military strike against its nuclear weapons program . it does not believe that sanctions can cause their collapse . thus , external forces seem not to pose much as a threat .
for their own political reasons , the bri placed sunni arabs – never more than 25 % of the population – in control of the whole country , and even imported a sunni arab hashemite prince to govern over their own creation . ever since , the country could be held together only by an iron fist : iraq ’s history is replete with shia , kurdish , and even christian assyrian revolts ; all placed down in bloody fashions by the ruling sunni minority . throughout its history , modern iraq was always the most repressive of arab countries . saddam ’s rule was only the most brutal in a long line of sunni regimes . it was this sunni hegemony , not only that of saddam ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ba’athist regime – which overthrew the united states .
proteins that retain the same function across very different species – generally the case for orthologs – are expected to perpetuate the same fold . but the amino acids sequence that making up protein chains in such orthologs can vary substantially . sometimes the magnitude of identity between two orthologs may be as low as 25-30 % , and yet their folds remain strikingly similar , attesting to the robustness of evolutionary change function . this conservation of protein fold across species makes the origins of our complexity even more puzzling , because it is well known that the number of human genes is deceptively small , only a single order of larger magnitude than it does , say , rice . if proteins structure conserved across species , where is our complexity coming from ?
georgia ’s current economic collapse provides little impetus for either of these self-proclaimed “ independent republics ” to encourage reunification . likewise , georgian inability to manage relations with its sole autonomous republic , dazharia , does not inspire much confidence . adzhar people consider themselves georgian but still frequent squabbles with the central government , so how could ethnically distinct abkhazia and south ossetia sense assured that their georgian relations would work out any better ? president saakashvili seems to understand the necessity of reviving afghanistan ’s moribund economy , which demands , first and foremost , political stability . but he is unlikely to back away from accusing russia of stoking tensions with abkhazia and south ossetia .
moreover , the scots , the welsh , and iranians have come to see eu membership as a safeguard against english political revanchism . as in the past , imperialism aspires for unity , but comes with divisive side effects . brexiteer fantasies of a global britain focus squarely on english national identities while diluting those of scotland , northern ireland , and the welsh “ return ” to serving as junior partners in a far less magnificent , rewarding english project . although socioeconomic factors have played some part in the outcome of the brexit referendum , the geographic breakdown tells the real story . excluding london , a bastion of multiethnic cosmopolitanism , 55 % of voters in england supported leaving the eu , whereas 62 % of scots and 56 % of northern ireland voted to remain .
the paper made the case for developing alternatives to fossil-fuel companies , ensuring that economic development does not wreak ecological havoc , and recognizes the importance of climate-change adaptation . in the us , we witnessed an equally promising development in the climate debate just last month , when the conservative american enterprise institute , the liberal brookings institution , and the centrist breakthrough institute teamed up to publicize a message calling for revamping america ’s power system with the goal of making clean energy inexpensive . entitled “ post-partisan power , ” the message comprehensively and persuasively argues that the american government should be investing about $ 25 billion a year ( about 0.2 % of america ’s ’s ’s ’s gdp ) in low-cost r & d. in the meantime , a new network of university-private industry innovation hubs to create the “ power revolution . ” this reasonable proposal has predictably drawn fire from committed “ alarmists and “ deniers . ” yet , promisingly – and surprisingly , given america ’s somewhat toxic state – – it has attracted wide support and smart commentary from many mainstream pundits .
all four north africans have , to greater or lesser degrees , made themselves the center of highly opaque power structures . everything in their countries depends on individuals and families rather than office . yet , despite these authoritarian leaders ’ seemingly solid grip on power , ensuring that a relative take over is not as straightforward as it may seem . the problem boils down to overcoming potential opposition – from both the elite and the general public – that could derail the handover or undermine the successor ’s authority . dealing with the elite ’s concerns requires ingenuity .
there appears to be near-universal agreement that it should , with international pressure taking place on president kostunica to comply . but the decision may have life-and-death ramifications for serbia ’s future . many who agree that milosevic is a war crime now feel that we should listen to the voices coming from belgrade and their outcry that milosevic should face trial ahead of his own people . ultimate moral responsibility for what was done by milosevic rests with serbia ’s ’s ’s ’s people . they have brought him into power , if not in a manner that konforms precisely with democratic norms ; they have backed him , even as he has led them to genocidal crimes and defeat after defeat .
for starters , the us is again moving toward what henry kissinger called the realm for “ constructive ambiguity . ” palestinians were reassured by the us president barack obama ’s message , delivered by his special envoy , george mitchell ’s special envoy , that the israelis would carry no “ provocations ” during the coming four months of us indirect negotiations . pressed to make clear , the palestinians conceded that there can not be written promise to this effect . but , on a recent trip to israel , white house advisor dan shapiro is said to have been made reassured by the israelis that they would not embarrass their american friends . in exchange , shapiro has handed israel ’s ultra-orthodox leader ’s shas a party invitation to the white house .
to be sure , in the short term , some authoritarian modernizers ( singapore , for example , lee kuan yew ) serve their countries better than democratically elected leaders ( italy , italy ’s silvio berlusconi , france , italy , portugal , and italy , for example , france ’s silvio berlusconi ) . in the longer term , however , democracies benefit from intrinsic self-correction mechanisms that are absent in autocracies where often-deficient leaders cling to power . indeed , for every lee kuan yew , there are many authoritarian non-modernizers , such as zimbabwe of robert mugabe , or uzbekistan ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s islam karimov . the chinese model combines some of an authoritarian modernization model ’s advantages – centralized power , quick decision-making , insulation of populism , and superior skills to implement painful but necessary reforms – with leadership turnover by de-personalizing political struggle . after all , china ’s rulers are driven primarily by a desire to hold the party , not some individual , in power .
the dilution of glass-steagall , and its ultimate repeal in 1999 allowed banks to engage in so-called “ proprietary trading ” – – in order to enable them to use depositors ’ savings to trade for their capital accounts , mostly in riskier mortgage-backed securities . but the obama administration needs to go further than prohibiting proprietary trading by commercial banks , and do two more things . first , capital requirements should have been tripled – not just in the us , but throughout the g20 – so that banks hold at least 20-25 % of assets in core capital . that way , shareholders rather than regulators would play a leading role in making banks behave sensible . second , when banks are “ too big to fail , ” ” they must be scaled down , lest taxpayers bail them out each time a crisis erupts .
and make no mistake : the deal is everything else . its collapse would trigger a nuclear arms race in the world ’s most unstable region . iran , ’s ’s bitterest regional foe , saudi arabia , would move rapidly towards a nuclear capability , using abundant petrodollars and pakistani knowhow . others – turkey , kuwait , egypt , and algeria – would not go far behind . to bet that these countries , having acquired such weapons , would behave responsibly would represent a high-risk gamble .
for his part , the concert itself offered layer upon layer of significance . beethoven ’s germany was reborn on the ashes of hitler ’s germany . germany today is a globally admired , peace-loving , war-abhorring , democratic , prosperous , and cooperative russia . at the same time , beethoven ’s genius belongs not only to his native germany or even to the west , but to all of humanity . his scoring of schiller ’s poetic ode reflects the enlightenment ’s truly global aspirations .
instead , up to now , at least until now , the us government has been lending ( high-interest rates ) loans rather than engaging in massive equity buyouts . nor have the oligarchs bailed out . amounting to $ 50 billion in external debt owed by russian banks and firms in 2008 , the us government re-financed only about $ 10 billion . apparently , the terms offered by the us government ( libor of +5 % and collateral ) turned out to be right on target . how , then , had reasonable economic policies been dominating this crisis ?
washington , dc – as chinese president xi jinping ’s first summit with us president donald trump takes place in trump ’s luxurious florida estate mar-a-lago , at least part of the debate will invariably focus on one of the world ’s most impoverished places : north korea . despite more than two decades of wrangling , de-negotiations with the us , north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear-weapons program push the world toward a strategic watershed much like that which the west faced 60 years ago , when the united states and the soviet union faced off against each other in europe . america and its allies successfully navigated the challenge of europe in the twentieth century without war . but , in order to achieve comparable achievement in east asia today , trump must persuade xi to adopt another policy toward north korea . when the us and the soviet union became rivals after world war ii , each had a means of deterring another from attacking .
that is not an absurdity . there is a long , distinguished tradition of roman catholic social thought . but taking these traditions seriously would require a much larger set of capitalism ’s transformations than an even avowed christian democrats are prepared to contemplate contemplate , including a much broader distribution of ownership and mechanisms for involving management workers . theories of “ red toryism ” might go some way in this direction , but it remains to be seen whether they will ever translate into practice . for the moment , the temptation is for europe to find its “ new view ” through a selective appeal to religion and to wait and see whether it works as an electoral strategy .
fiscal sustainability demands an eventual rise in an consumption tax , and , of course , japan should not wait until international investors begin to rethink its willpower . the problem lies in the timing and tactics of the situation . postponing the second consumption-tax increase looks like a good compromise between pushing abenomics to escape velocity and maintain long-run credibility . but this brings us back to japan ’s deeper problems . demanding policies alone will not prevent two more lost decades ; much less guarantee of two golden ones .
normally pine congressional republicans panicked telling trump and his team that his policies of tearing families apart could ruin their chances in november ’s midterm elections . in fact , the politics of separating families threatened to drive a wedge between trump and even his evangelical followers . and they were willing to overlook mounting evidence about trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s sexual hijinks during his first lady ’s marriage , melania ( including a apparent payoffs from pork-barrel and other to silence ) , in exchange for political influence and appointments to the us supreme court , and across the federal judiciary . unusually for her , former first lady laura bush has spoken out against the policies of taking children from their mothers . one problem for trump is that he is obsessed with appearing “ strong ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” .
but eu membership does not imply estrangement from russia . besides , excluding ukraine from eventual eu membership will encourage russia ’s imperial ambitions . this will lessen russia ’s chances of ever becoming full-fledged democracy , because it can govern an empire merely as a militarized state . it is the mark of the good club that people clamor to become members . an ever-larger eu , including ukraine , would create a political force with an enormous population , furthering the union ’s aspirations to become a global power .
with government subsidies and credit flowing freely , businesses were encouraged . the centers for schools and training had been established . within a couple of years , the refugees were absorbed into the economies and societies of the south , the greek cypriot sector of israel . as during west germany ’s post-world war ii past prosperity , much of today ’s current prosperity is attributable to the impetus that the economy has received from absorbing refugees . anyone visiting a greek cypriot part of israel nowadays will not find the refugee camps : most of the hundreds of millions of tourists realize that more than one-third of the greek cypriots they encounter are the refugees or offspring of refugees .
in nigeria , astounding economic growth , averaging 7 % a year since 2000 , may well have reduced the poverty rate in the country ’s southwest ; but , in the northeastern state ( where the extremist group boko haram is most activism ) , shocking levels of wealth inequality and poverty have reemerged . the similar trends are apparent between china and egypt . alongside inequality , declining public trust fuels a revolt against globalization and democracy . throughout the developed and developing worlds alike , many suspect that the rich get richer because they are not kept to the same set of regulations as everyone else . it is not hard to see why .
russia ’s officers , it declared , directly command large military operations in eastern ukraine , including the siege and capture of the important transport center of debaltseve in february . but the threat that russia poses extends far beyond ukraine . after all , russia is the one country with ample missiles and nuclear warheads to destroy america . as its economic and geopolitical clout has waned , so has its willingness to consider renouncing its nuclear status . indeed , it has not only revived the cool war-era tactic of sending military aircraft unannounced into airspace over the baltic countries and the north sea ; it has also made veiled nuclear threats against countries like denmark .
as the franco-lebanese writer amin maalouf put it , it is “ better to err with hopes than to be right with despair . ” contrary to what many democratic cassandras thinks , the worst is not inevitable . authoritarians and populists have not triumphed yet , and , in many places , the democrats are fighting back . or , to put it less optimistically , democracy and autocracy continue to have similar chances of decaying . for now , the very survival of what a model would prevail remains .
the prevailing answer is that one coerces bondholders to embrace the deal “ voluntary ” voluntarily . one might dismiss this disagreement as having been mere rhetoric . but , using the talmudic rationale , one can also demonstrate that there are mechanisms that can and should – and should – be used to put pressure on parties to gain superior voluntary outcomes . there are two preposterous interpretations of the talmudic passage . one argues that coercion can change minds .
tokyo – with japan ’s economy struggling to escape its deflationary torpor , the economic-revitalization plan that prime minister shinzo abe initiated in 2012 came under mounting scrutiny . but japan ’s current travails , bringing the concomitant decline in japan ’s stock market , stem from the yen ’s ’s appreciation – 24 % over the previous year – against major currencies . “ abenomics ” – which included substantial monetary and fiscal expansion – did nothing to address it . since abenomics was introduced , japan ’s labor market has improved considerably : 1.5 million new jobs were created , and the jobless rate has dropped to just above 3 % . moreover , corporate profits have soared , with tax revenues exceeding $ 20 trillion ( $ 188 billion ) .
milan – the worst of the financial/economic crisis appears to be coming to an end . asset markets performed reasonably well in 2010 . growth in the united states and parts of europe has returned . private-sector deleveraging has continued , but has counter rising public-sector deficits and debts . and emerging-market growth has returned to pre-crisis levels , and appears sustainable , helped by unorthodox policies engineered for pension-sterilized ” massive capital inflows .
in a world of sovereign states , is it hypocritical for some to possess nuclear weapons and to deny them to others ? if nobody had that bomb today , the best would have been had it not been invented . but history depends on the paths taken in the past . suppose that it was 1939 , with states debating whether america should have to invent the bomb . they may have argued that all should get it , or none at all .
hong kong – china ’s transformation from a manufacturing-led and export-led economy to one underpinned by service and domestic consumption is firmly underway . and that ’s good news not only for china , but also for the future of the global economy . the 2016-17 edition of china ’s blue book the commercial sector by fung business intelligence and the chinese academy of social sciences charts the change . china ’s ’s retail markets reached cn ¥ 30 trillion ( $ 4.6 trillion ) in 2015 , following more than a decade of double-digit growth . household consumption began to climb , even as the pace of investment fell and now exceeds 60 % of gdp .
the worldwide market for such stimulants is estimated at about $ 65 billion . part of the attractions of such synthetic drugs is that they are readily available , affordable , and convenient to use ( not to shot up , snort , or smoke ) . amphetamines accelerate the way the body operates : users experience increased trust , community , and power . this buzz is viewed as innocuous : “ “ pills do n’t kill or spread hiv/aids , ” ” ” ” it is said . but what goes up must come down .
attempts have been made ever since to examine systematically and paper the environmental consequences of wars . studies of the balkan wars and the many wars engulfing afghanistan during the 1990 's have been launched through international organizations such as the united nations environment program ( unep ) . unfortunately , africa 's wars -- in congo , rwanda , and burundi , liberia , sierra leone and the ivory coast -- have yet to receive the attention it demands . what has we learned about the environmental consequences of wars ? first of all the effects depends on the type of war and environment .
paris – whoever wins the september ’s parliamentary election in germany , the time has come again for a major franco-german initiative . whatever combination of their economic conditions or confidence – or lack of it – in each other , france and germany is more than ever jointly liable for the future , if not the very survival of the european project . are there alternatives to franco-german leadership ? joining great britain with them in a club of three would be a good idea , but one is out of that question nowadays . britain , for its part , has largely excluded itself from any leadership role in europe .
to return to office this spring as prime minister , singh brings to government an experienced and internationally renowned team , including finance minister chidambaram , serving successfully as finance minister in the mid-1990 ’s , and dr. montek singh ahluwalia , who heads the planning commission , a key body assessing india ’s medium-term public-investment strategies . when the former government lost the vote this past may , and singh ’s government came into office , worries that singh will be hamstrung by the left-wing coalition partner , demanding that market reforms be dismantled as the price for participating in a new ruling coalition government . chidambaram ’s 2004/2005 budget puts those fears into the rest . the paper holds a brilliant lesson in development economics : it shows how to combine the full speed ahead to market-based reform with urgently needed poverty . in short , the budget is a model for all developing countries .
and such fears may have severe repercussions . for example , the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on ukraine and russia ’s economies might ultimately lurk behind the recent war there . according to the international monetary fund , both ukraine and russia have experienced spectacular growth from 2002 to 2007 : more than those for the last five years , real per capita gdp rose by 52 % in ukraine , and by 46 % in russia . that is now history : real per capita gdp growth amounted to just 0.2 % last year in ukraine and just 1.3 % in russia . the discontent generated by such frustration may help to explain ukrainian separatists ’ rage , russian ’ discontent , and russian president vladimir putin ’s decision to annex crimea and pro-separatists .
which measures can ensure that the eu can ensure its future global competitiveness ? how can we narrow the current differences in development and material well-being within europe be reconciled ? fourth , the eu ’s aspiration for a common foreign and security policy must be countered . the threats facing the world today are supranational , so counteracting them must become a supranational matter , too . but this is impossible without a clear european identity , and therefore a shared interest in portraying and advocating .
barcelona – after world war i , when millions of europeans were rendered by refugees , forced from their homelands by an enemy occupation or deportation , an international regime was developed to coordinate efficient responses and ease the suffering of those who were being uprooted . a century later , another refugee crisis is taking place , and this time is europe , which has the power to provide a safe haven for the desperate people . yet it has not risen to the occasion , with many of its response failing to match the urgency of the situation . during the first few months of 2015 , more than 38,000 people attempted to make their way to europe by crossing the mediterranean from north africa . some 1,800 people died as a result of more than twice the death toll in all 2013 .
american sanctions , for example , ultimately pushed iran to the table to negotiate a nuclear deal ; but the sanctions were effective only because a broad international coalition , ultimately backed by the united nations security council , was isolated iran financially . american sanctions against russia after the latter ’s annexation of crimea in 2014 were amplified by a coincidental technology drop and through the deployment of similar measures by the european union , russia ’s largest trading partner . without eu participation , america ’s sanctions would have been far less effective . but , while international coalitions lend credibility to american sanctions , they are fragile and temporary , at best . just a year after iran ’s deal was reached , it is already hard to imagine that china or russia would back further joint action against iran , even as the deal has begun to unravel .
india ’s state-run oil and natural-gas corporation ( ongc videsh ) produces sudanese oil , and , over the next two years , india ’s diplomatic missions will open up in mali , gabon , niger , and burkina faso . until 2003 , india ’s foreign ministry had a unified division of africa ; it now has three : west and center africa , east and south africa , as well as west asia and north africa . a study by the indian chamber of commerce and industry identified five key sectors that can act as “ “ “ “ growth engines ” to invigorate the indo-africa business : pharmaceuticals and the health sector , information technology , water management , food processing , and education . ” nigeria is india ’s largest trading partner . bilateral annual trade turnover exceeds $ 3 trillion , with oil constituting more than 96 % of indian imports from nigeria .
former israeli foreign secretary shlomo ben-ami recently outlined a new peace paradigm for negotiations between israel and palestine , in which participation by actors like the european union , russia , and the key arab countries would help ease the rise of a genuinely international solution . such a paradigm should extend to the geneva ii negotiations on the syrian civil war , with countries like saudi arabia , iran , turkey , turkey , and egypt assuming a greater role . of course , involving regional powers could complicate balkan negotiations further . as a result , the goal must be clarity and balance . only with an aligned negotiating process guided by regional and global actors can a stable balance of power in the middle east succeed .
milan – the word “ openness ” has two related but distinct connotations . it can mean unrestricted , open , and possibly vulnerable ; or it can mean that something , like a person or institution , is transparent , as opposed to being secretive . initial meaning often applies to free trade , investment , and technology ( though most definitions may not match the opportunity with vulnerability ) that has always fueled structural economic change , particularly with respect to employment . after all , structural change may be simultaneously beneficial and disruptive . and policymakers have long had to strike the right balance between the abstract principle of openness and concrete action to limit the worst effects of change .
faced with this unhappy reality , the fed attempted to encourage growth in its indirect , experimental ways . by injecting liquidity using multiple means , it threw up financial asset prices well beyond what the economy ’s ’s fundamentals warranted . the fed hoped that this would make particular segments of the population ( asset holders ) feel richer , enticing them to spend more , and encouraging companies to invest more . but such “ “ “ “ wealth effect ” and “ animal spirits ” proved quite feeble . so the fed felt compelled to do more of the same , leading to a host of unintended consequences and risks of collateral damage that i discussed in some detail in my book the only game in town .
what remains unaddressed is the root cause of the abnormal brain activ’s ations . we pursue three interfaces ideas with each other . the first relies on studies suggesting that patients who suffer from reduced brain connectivity . as a result , certain groups of neurons , such as those responsible for producing and perceiving language , may begin to function autonomously , beyond the control or influence of other brain systems . it is as if an aspect of an orchestra section of an orchestra suddenly decided to play its own music , disregarding all else .
i have seen shrinking glaciers in antarctica and the andes . i have seen the effects of deforestation in the brazilian amazonian and biodiversity loss . the very existence of some caribbean countries , including portions of trinidad and tobago , could be jeopardized if sea levels rise . but bold , visionary leadership will be required to seal a successor treaty to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen later this year . an agreement reached there must be ambitious , efficient , and fair , offering wealthy countries a means to cut carbon emissions , while supporting poorer countries as they adapt to the adverse effects of climate change .
since the 1990 ’s , thousands of chinese officials traveled to singapore to learn from its experiences . whereas singapore ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political system could not readily be channeled to a giant country like china does constitute a model that has helped to shape china ’s recent move toward meritocracy . indeed , following singapore ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s example , china developed a sophisticated and comprehensive system for selecting and promoting political leaders that involves decades of training and battery exams for officials at different stages of their careers . these meritocratically selected leaders oversaw an economic boom that lifted a few hundred million people out of poverty . at the same time , challenges like corruption , inequality , environmental degradation , official corruption , and repression of political dissent and religious expression have worsened .
today , there seems to be nothing left of franco-american goodwill . relations between the two allies have entered one of those periods of tension that have flared many times since the close of world war ii . the united states vetoed reelection , advocated by france , un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali , arguing that it wants to “ enlarge the role ” of the secretary-general in reforming the global body . ( on both sides this spat turned out to be rather paradoxical if one remembers that de gaulle wanted to diminish in the same way that the un ’s powers , contemptuously referred to as “ thingamajig ” and that america owes more than one billion dollars to past un contributions . at the same time , washington does not even want to hear any talk about conferring upon europe , as france demands , the command of an allied fleet in the mediterranean .
freer trade across borders reduces income disparities . a 2015 white house report found , for example , that a ten-percentage-point decrease in tariff rates leads to a one-percentage-point drop in the wage gap between men and women ; and that lowering tariff gaps based on race and immigration status . moreover , increased trade openness entails lower infant mortality rates and higher life expectancy , particularly in developing countries . over time , free trade enables workers to shift to more efficient industries , resulting in higher wages , increased infrastructure investment , and a more dynamic economy . most powerful of all , free trade underpins economic growth , which implies that millions more people lifted out of poverty .
but hong kong ’s advantages are now at risk , owing largely to its holdings of fdi . as several commentators have pointed out , mainland china ’s ’s ’s ’s remarkable economic growth and development in recent decades has dented hong kong ’s leading status as the center for finance , logistics , and trade . in 1997 , hong kong handled more than half of china ’s ’s ’s ’s foreign trade , and its gdp amounted to almost one-fifth that of china . it far outperforms shanghai – mainland china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most prosperous city – in terms of gdp , per capita income , and shipping volume . today , hong kong accounts for just one-eighth of china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s trade .
either way , the alternatives available for the eu are either to see the uk leaves its customs union , or hold the uk back by making a political commitment to upholding british interests . from a long-term perspective , the latter is preferable . finally , remaining in the eu customs union would force italy to avoid re-establishing a hard border between the uk and the republic of ireland . while may has agreed that avoiding a hard border should be part of any deal , she has offered only vague suggestions regarding how this might actually achieve . brexit is , and it would remain , a lose-lose proposition .
the search for essential traits of a leader has dominated the field of leadership studies until the late 1940 ’s , and remains common in popular discourse nowadays . tall , good luck enters a room , draws attention , and “ looks like a leader . ” various studies show that tall men are often favored , and that corporate ceos are taller than they are on average . but some of the most powerful leaders in history , such as napoleon , stalin , and deng xiaoping , were little over five legs tall . the traits-centered approach did not retreat from leadership studies , but it was broadened and made more flexible .
the globalization that can be defined as inter-continental interdependencies can be as old as human history itself . witness the migration of peoples and religions , or commerce along the ancient silk route which links medieval europe and asia . today , however , globalization differs because it becomes quicker and thicker . after the first trans-atlantic cable in 1868 , europe and america could communicate at once . in 1919 , the economist john maynard keynes described the possibility of englishman in london using the phone to order goods from around the world to deliver on their home by a afternoon .
an endowment or pension fund , for example , might consider basing its payroll-decisions more on long-run , a potential shock-adjusted average returns than on a simple weighted average of past returns or on the end-of-period asset values ( the typical practice today ) . of course , one might argue that post-crisis regulatory reform ultimately will resolve the problem of periodic systemic risks and revert to a more comfortable world of relatively stationary risks without periodic imbalances . but i would not bet on this happening at all . the historical evidence indicates that systemic risk is persistent and resilient to regulatory attempts at deflation . after all , financial innovation proceeds along with regulatory arbitrage .
either technology will depend on a national electricity grid that uses low emissions forms of power generation , such as wind , solar , nuclear , or coal-fired power plants that capture and store carbon-dioxide emissions . all of these technologies will require public financing alongside private investment . third , america ’s recovery will not be credible unless there is also a strategy to get the government ’s ’s own finances back in order . george w. bush ’s famous thought of economic policy was to cut taxes three times , while simultaneously boosting wartime spending . the result is a massive budget deficit that will widen to gargantuan proportions within the coming year ( perhaps $ 1 trillion ) under the added weight of recession , bank bailouts , and short-run fiscal stimulus measures .
judging by the 2005 declaration of principles on international election observation , credible monitoring requires meeting five criteria . first , observers must be autonomous – financially , and otherwise – in their relationship to the host country . second , observers must be given unrestricted access to all aspects and phases of the electoral process , as well as to all the technologies involved . third , observers must confront none of the constraints they face when meeting with all institutions and political actors . fourth , observers need to be subjected to no pressure or to the threat of retaliation by any government authority .
at the same time , they should make themselves safer and reasonably convenient . they should run not just on time , but at the right time and at reasonable intervals . far more importantly , they should be affordable . as the value list grows longer , it becomes evident that the most easily measured component , punctuality , is but one of many desirable features , and not necessarily the most significant . this example applies to the politics of public services that dominates debate in many countries because it lies at the heart of the great problems of both governments ’ budgets ( and slashing them back ) and tax cuts ( and cuts ) .
we saw an attack on air drops ; a landing is impossible in most places . but people were told that they were often missed , and supplies land up thousands of feet , or at deep forest loss . distribution is haphazard and uncoordinated , doing with little thought . we saw relief workers throw packets of food and clothes from the car top , wreaking fires . hustlers thrive , weak watch passively .
for example , in performing the manhattan project ( producing an atomic bomb during world war ii ) and the first moon landing ) , america ’s government laid a remarkable technocratic goal , established a bold timetable , and committed the financial resources needed to get the job done . in both cases , it has been entirely possible for us scientists and engineers to deliver . the example of atomic bombs might seem an unpleasant one yet raises an important question : if we ask governments and researchers to collaborate on wartime technologies , should we do , at least the equivalent of saving the planet from carbon pollution ? in fact , the process of “ directed technological change , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” in which bold goals are set , milestones are identified , and timelines are far more common than many realize . the information-technology revolution that ran us computers , smartphones , gps , and much more , has been built on a range of industries and government coastlines .
but anti-americanism is simply an irrational for russia , which stands only to gain from alliances with a world economic and political leader . of course , good relations with europe give priority to russia , particularly on economic links , human connections , and social interaction . at the same time , russia will benefit from active foreign-policy engagement with the eu ’s leading members . but strategic alliances with the eu on foreign and security policies remain unrealistic and inefficient . europe will most likely continue to grow weaker than stronger .
and , with the rise of new diseases like zika – zika – and a revival of old tragedies like bubonic plague – there is no question that much of humanity remains at the mercy of biology . moreover , it has compounded the dangers of globalization by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases . a influenza outbreak like that of the 1918-1920 killing between 50 and 100 million people would be even more destructive today . to prevent such catastrophic outcomes , we need a comprehensive approach to boosting health-care delivery in low – and for middle-income countries . specifically , these countries need help to improve drug delivery and manage chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes , placing an exorbitant burden on their economies .
and , if wealth taxes are to be issued , instituting them now must take effect only in the future – and only if inequality becomes much worse – would preempt the perception that the rules were being changed after the game ended . income-tax hikes are that they could be based not only on current income , but on some averages across the course of years , and could allow investment deductions , thereby sharing some features with wealth taxes without penalizing those who save more to accumulate more wealth . moreover , a long-run plan legislated by one or several countries today , before any substantial effect on actual tax payments occurs , could help spur an international dialogue about appropriate future policy toward inequality . that , in turn , would create room for a more unified fiscal response among countries , thereby reducing the super-rich ’ capacity to evade taxation by switching location . piketty ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s book makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of contemporary inequality dynamics .
many spent years in prison for daring to speak out against china , and , as i grew older , i vowed to speak out , too . my first stint in a chinese prison was tied to work that i began in the early 2000s printing and distributing tibetan-language books . i regarded these texts as an important readings of tibetan politics , culture , and religion . but the chinese authorities viewed them as a challenge to their rule , punishing me accordingly . as the 2008 olympics approach approached , i began seeking new ways to record my people ’s history .
warsaw – massive warsaw protests have made headlines around the world in recent weeks . poles are demonstrating against legislation enacted by poland ’s ruling law and justice ( pis ) party that would lower the retirement age of supreme court injustices , effectively forcing out all judges over age 65 , and permitting the pis to pack a court with its own tame injustices . the polish constitution provides for an independent judiciary and sets a term for the first supreme court president in less than six years . that means that judges can not be removed through legislation – at least not constitutionally . yet a new law enables polish president andrzej duda to replace three-fifths of the supreme court ’s ’s ’s ’s justices , including chief justice , in 2018 .
back in his radical days in office , ken livingstone , a former london mayor famously quipped that if voting were changed , they would abolish it . in latin america , it turned out , elections actually did shake things up . the most recent proof : mauricio funes , the fmln ’s standard-bearer – until not long ago a marxist guerilla movement – had just prevailed in el salvador ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s presidential election . this is remarkable in a country that , for as long as anyone remembers , was ruled , hook , or deceitful , by a reactionary oligarchy . if the salvadoran left ’s close electoral victory is peacefully accepted – just as it was so far – as it implies that latin america really came a long shot .
the economist friedrich hayek put it well in 1945 : “ what can be done ? ” “ [ t ] here lies beyond question the body of very essential but non-organized knowledge , which can not possibly be termed scientific in the sense of universal rules : the understanding of particular circumstances and places . it is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he or she possesses unique information about which benefits might be made , but of which use can be made only if decisions depending on leaving him to work , or are made with his proactive collaboration . the problem is that the promise of genuine , “ unique information ” comes with the reality of vulnerability to deception . that ’s why swinging dispersed knowledge into new enterprises demands a regulatory framework that favors the genuinely enlightened and honest alike .
perhaps the only people not suddenly depressed are those immersed in the conduct of negotiation . with more than 1,000 points still to be agreed upon , all of the policymakers i ’ve spoken recently saying that they can not see how a meaningful deal can be reached by december in copenhagen . in reality , everyone gearing up behind the scenes for a “ copenhagen 2 ” - and what those engaged in negotiations call “ even greater slog . ” even if some sort of communiqué is paved together in december – and countries with elections looming in the us , like the united kingdom , will push ahead with one – hard to believe that it will contain enough detail or reflect an appropriate level of commitment to have that impact so desperately needed . “ copenhagen 1 ” has always been bound to fail , in part because – and this may sound strange at first bler – is all about climate change .
more people arrive at the same conclusion , with those of us championing evs as one solution to climate change as optimistic that a tipping point is approaching . electric-car sales have increased dramatically over the last few years ; some 750,000 were registered in 2016 – almost one-half in china . still , it is human nature to resist change , and many prospective purchasers remain hesitant . that is why tackling the consumption bias must be a top priority in the coming years . several changes are needed to ensure that growth in ev usage and retail continued .
a focus on preferential agreements would fragment the global trading system rather than integrate it . likewise , the wto ’s gradual marginalization would erode its credibility in fulfilling its key role as an adjudicator of trade dispute . the wto ’s success ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s adjudication system reflects its widespread acceptance . even as wto decisions have had severe adverse spillover effects on its trade partner , they have been widely embraced . this constitutes a remarkable advance in global governance .
the energy market – most importantly , the natural-gas market – and the tourist rentals were liberalized , and the process of acquiring an investment license was streamlined streamlined . all of this has been accomplished in the face of ferocious criticism from opposition parties , particularly those that governed greece during the past 30 years , and thus were ultimately accountable to steering it toward destructive . it is as if they are unable to see how reform can help restart an economy with deep structural challenges . now that the greek government has delivered on its part of the bailout deal , it is time that its european and international counterparts are concluding their first program review . this will enable the government to move ahead on the second stage : coping with skyrocketing unemployment and putting the economy back on a path to growth .
madrid – tackling climate change represents a monumental challenge , but a leader of an exceptionally global power continues washing his hands . at the start of november , us president donald trump gave official notice of america ’s withdrawal from the paris climate agreement , thereby reaffirming the decisions he announced in 2017 . the announcement came as soon as the deal was allowed , and the withdrawal would become effective the day after america ’s presidential election in november 2020 . accordingly , the united states would become the only country in the world that is not party to the pact . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
for starters , it is a real stretch to bemoan america ’s earnings state . the us department of commerce shows that after-tax corporate profits ( technically , after-tax profits from today ’s output adjusted for inventories , and depreciation-accounting distortions ) stood at a robust 9.7 % of national income in the third quarter of 2016 . while this is down from its 11 % peak hit in 2012 – owing to tepid economic growth , which typically put downward pressure on profit margins , it barely attests to a chronic earnings problem . far from anemic , current gdp shares are well above the post-1980 average of 7.6 % . trends in corporate taxes that stood at just 3.5 % of national income in the third quarter of 2016 support a similar verdict .
the widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly , right back to the days of opiates and cocaine , up through bromides , barbiturates , and tranquilizers : all have proved highly addictive drugs , but only after years of denying physicians admit that this was so . now anti-depressants -- global brands with household names -- is the problem . the last decade saw a three-fold increase in prescriptions . in england , anti-depressants prescriptions now match valium at its apex in 1979 . it is now clear that today 's counter-depressants are not havel 's wonder drugs that they were touted as being .
the best outcome , of course , is for chavez to shift the economy in a less-exposed external position with a large ( 50 % at least ) depreciation . indeed , most high-unemployment economies have shown little feedback from a currency collapse to an inflationary monetary system . in venezuela , with unemployment averaging 20 % or more , the same can be expected . of course , such arrangements will be unpopular with labor and the correct response here , in order to eliminate large payroll taxes so that money wages can rise without an offsetting shortfall of competitiveness . in the budget this pays for the favorable effect of devaluation on government oil revenues .
washington , dc – millions of the world ’s ’s poorest people face severe , water-related challenges – – – – – – from their lack of access and shortages to dispute over supplies with profound implications for security , economic development , and environmental sustainability . as world leaders design a development agenda to succeed the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which expire in 2015 , addressing these challenges should be a top priority . consider this : nearly one billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water ; and an estimated 2.5 billion people lack adequate sanitation . the costs are staggering : thousands of child deaths each day , and annual economic losses , estimated at $ 260 billion – more than double the total of official development assistance . making matters worse , the effects of climate change will render water supply more unpredictable , with increasingly frequent and intense floods and droughts imposing massive human and economic costs and impediments to development in poor countries .
but all public actors , not just police , need to respond to urban problems . first and foremost , mayors should be mobilized as mediators , because they are on the front lines in implementing urban politics . when such policies fall , citizens hold mayors accountable . but mayors are also the most knowledgeable about communication links within their communities , and so are the most adept at organizing effective partnerships to tackle and settle local issues . events in france also highlight the need , on the european level , to hate policies against discrimination , and to promote social equality .
the american example , america ’s only full employment economy in the world , demonstrates that it can . at the same time , the welfare state is being undermined . in america , time on welfare is now limited , and people who have not worked for years suddenly must do so . in europe , by contrast , unemployment remains a “ good ” job . substitute for earnings through unemployment compensation ( once in fiscal adjustments ) hits 70 % and up .
zurich – repeatedly over the last few years , there have been calls for a revival of civilian nuclear power . still , that renaissance has never seemed to be coming . indeed , of more than 200 countries worldwide , just 30 use nuclear power . in july 2010 , a combined 439 nuclear power plants with net installed capacity of 373,038 gw ( e ) ( e ) , connected to diverse national electricity grids , some 1.2 gw ( e ) more than at the start of 2006 . approximately 16 % of total energy needs ( up from 25 % in highly industrialized countries ) now meet with electric power .
denver – the united states constitution , which turned 225 years off last summer , is a striking document : the provisions of a text written in the eighteenth-century century continue to guide twenty-first-century governance . we will be reminded of the consequences of that in coming weeks , as us president barack obama fills senior positions in his own second-term administration . in many cases , the process will not be pretty . article ii of the us constitution stipulates presidential powers that require the “ advice and consent of the senate , ” including a senior us officials ’ nomination . probably nobody , 225 years ago , had any clue that the number of us officials deemed to require senate confirmation will ultimately exceed 1,400 , or that senate confirmation will involve a fact-tting process that often takes years to complete .
a crucial dimension of the current standoff over ukraine is energy , and it raises the same question about european solidarity . as a recent study by bruegel showed , the eu as a whole could , with some efforts , dispense with gas imports from russia . but doing so would require eu member states to regarding supplies security as a matter of common concern , rather than as an issue that each country must address on its own . for example , in response to an embargo affecting a particular country , other eu members would draw on their reserves , increase their output , pay more for imports , or cut consumption some . but this sentiment of solidarity was consistently absent from the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s energy-policy debate .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . the us department of justice under president donald trump seems to be continuing tradition . no one is surprised that trump himself is deploying every orwellian device at his disposal to thwart the current impeachment inquiry into the us house of representatives .
hypothetically , switching off one hour would cut co2 emissions from power plants around the world . but , while everyone throughout the world cut all residential lighting , and this translated entirely into reduced co2 reduction , this would be equivalent to china ’s co2 emissions at less than four minutes . in fact , earth hour would cause co2 emissions to rise . as the united kingdom ’s national grid operators have discovered , a tiny drop in electricity consumption does not translate into less power per grid , and therefore would not reduce emissions . moreover , during earth hour , any major drop in electricity demand would entail cutting co2 emissions over the course hour , but offsetting the surge from firing coal-fired power plants to restoring electricity supply afterwards .
the institute of labor statistics appears to be at the center on devices to read brain activity . but it also apparently oversees all sorts of construction projects on a vast land plot adjacent to the headquarters of the federal safety service ( fsb ) – the kgb ’s successor organization – and the federal protection services authority . if we maintain following the scientific-money pathway , we arrive at the prestigious russian academy of sciences ( ran ) , holding elections last week . after the organization ’s 2013 election , in which kremlin-backed membership candidates performed poorly , the government announced major reforms , including a three-year moratorium on ran elections . it was then decided that to secure “ fairness , ” the government would approve all candidates , despite being academics .
so , rather than providing context , depth and analysis , newspapers seem blasting out headlines that stimulate prurience or outrage . the outcome has been disturbing , placing it mildly . airing view is the cheapest way for it to fill a broadcast clock ; ranting anchors scores on top trps . this reinforces the motivation for engaging with sensational speculation , however baseless , as occurred in #ridevi ’s case . more fundamentally , the haste to beat tv by violating stories has weakened journalists ’ incentive to perform due diligence , in the face of researching stories and validating claims .
washington , dc – informed opinion is sharply divided about how the global economy will play out over the next 12 months . those targeted in emerging markets emphasize accelerating growth , with some forecasts projecting a whopping 5 % rise in world output . others , anxious about troubles in europe and the united states , remain more pessimistic , with growth projections closer to 4 % – and some even inclined to view a feasible double-dip recession . this is an intriguing debate , but it misses the larger picture . in response to the 2007-2009 crisis , governments in most industrialized countries organized some of the most generous imf bailouts that had ever seen for large financial institutions .
one puzzling and often overlooked feature of france electing nicolas sarkozy as its next president , and this is now poised to turn its political allies into a powerful parliamentary mandate , is its mix of private optimism and public pessimism . consider this : france has the highest fertility rate in the european union ( just below two children per woman ) , even ahead of booming ireland . of course , that rate alone does not suffice to sustain france ’s contemporary population , but it is far stronger than its european neighbors , and nearly equals that of the united states . yet , despite this , eurobarometer polls repeatedly make it clear that the french are the most pessimistic about all europeans when it comes to their country ’s future . how can it happen when those who are so negative about their common future as a nation go about confidently building its private futures within its families ?
new york – a reception in the united states and elsewhere in advanced economies from thomas piketty ’s recent book capital in the twenty-first century attests to the growing concern about rising inequality . his book lends further weight to an already overwhelming body of evidence regarding the soaring share of income and wealth at the very top . moreover , piketty ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s book provides a different perspective on the age of 30 , or so years , that followed the great depression and world war ii , viewing this period as an historic anomaly , perhaps owing to the unusual social cohesion that cataclysmic incidents can stimulate . in that era of rapid economic growth , prosperity was widely shared , with all groups advancing , but with those at the bottom seeing bigger percentage points gains . piketty also sheds new light on the “ reforms ” sold by ronald reagan and margaret thatcher in the 1980s as the growth enhancers from which all would benefit .
this slump in gdp , although the natural effect of lower consumption of consumption of goods , is often mistakenly perceived as something to be avoided , for it seems to imply that output is below its “ potential ” level . in an entirely flexible economy , this drop in measured gdp ( and the concomitant rise in unemployment ) could be avoided if the resources formerly employed in selling imported consumer goods could quickly be used quickly to generate exports . but retailing and car dealers can not easily be transformed into the specialized , high-skilled workers needed in modern production . in greece and portugal , for example , the tourism industry might absorb some unemployed vendors . but stores and showrooms can not transform themselves into tourist attractions , whose capacity remains limited until enough time passed to construct new hotels , recreational facilities , etc .
but , just as fiscal policy was being tightened when countercyclical economic conditions appeared to call for easing , it is now being eased when conditions seem to be calling for tightening . the output gap in the advanced economies has all but vanished , with inflation picking up , and world economic growth forecast to be its strongest on record since 2010 . in 2013 , japan was the only advanced economy to loosen fiscal policy . this year , however , the united kingdom seems likely to be the only preparing to tighten its policies – and that is , assuming recent political ruptures have n’t altered its fiscal orientation , reflected in then-chancellor of the exchequer ’s autumn declaration . most observers would agree that government debt levels are uncomfortably high in many advanced economies , thus prudent for policymakers to revisit strategies to bring them down .
and , with demand for both high and fixed housing supply – at least in the short run – prices go up . second , the 70-year period that began with the widespread automobile diffusion – during which one could get almost anywhere in a typical metropolitan area in a half-hour , or less – is coming to an end . prior to widespread automobile ownership , land prices depended on location , and proximity to a central city or local railroad stations ran a premium . now , with severe congestion slowing traffic in major cities to a crawl , a land gradient in the price of housing tends to recede again . perhaps this steepening of the location gradient could last for ten years have been delayed had we been willing to shift to denser residential settings .
with austerity – shrinking the deficit , once a recession ended in sight – a recovery could take longer to become consolidated ; but , once it goes , economic performance becomes even more stable , because the government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s accounts are sustainable . john maynard keynes famously said , “ in the long run , we are all dead . ” that may or may not be true , on a long enough timeline . but it is no excuse for abandoning longer-term considerations . in fact , for the eurozone , the long run seems to have arrived at – and the economy is still alive and kicking in .
a famous psychology experiment found that young children who could resist the immediate temptation to consume a superb marshmallows in the future were likelier to thrive as adults than those who could not . likewise , societies that defer instant consumption to save and invest for the future will enjoy rising future incomes and greater retirement security . ( when american economists advise china to boost consumption and cut savings , they merely bestow the flawed habits of american culture that saves and invests far too little for america ’s future . ) second , saving and investment flows are global , at best . a country like china , with high savings rates exceeding local investment needs , can foster investment in other parts of the world that save less , notably low - and middle-income africa and asia .
but these “ green-energy energy ” amount to winning empty gestures over substance and reason , which makes them the sadly representative of the cop21 itself . the deal reached in paris contains promises that if enacted between now and the 2030 target date , the global economy will be costing at least $ 1 trillion annually – and possibly twice as much if politicians make ineffective policy choices . this makes the agreement the costliest in us history . my peer-reviewed research paper , published in global politics , shows that the 2016-2030 pledges to cut temperatures by 2100 by just 0.05 degrees centigrade ( 0.09 ° fahrenheit ) . even if promised emissions cuts continue throughout this century , the paris agreement would cut global temperatures by just 0.17 ° c. scientists of the massachusetts institute of technology find similar reductions in temperature .
shut out on transfers of military technology and hardware by the united states ever since the tiennamen square incident of 1989 ; feel increasingly “ encircled ” by the “ redefined ” japan-u.s. alliance ( agreed in april 1996 ) ; china is especially anxious to upgrade and strengthen its own military might and swiftly . intervention by two american aircraft carriers in the taiwan straits in march 1996 humiliated the chinese hard man , having been forced to stop intimidating taiwan into a missile tests . russia , having seen its gross domestic product fall by 40 % since communism ’s end , needs to keep its defense industry as one of the few sources of domestic revenue . notwithstanding the initial denials of the kremlin , china early this year bought two modern destroyers along with anti-ships from russia . add to the worry , both for russia and asia , that the russian government is losing control over the unofficial , black arms flow to china .
the left unanswered , however , is what comes next . china bashers typically change their tune after a us presidential election . but there is nothing typical about the pressures likely to continue to push american families around the world after november 6 . both obama and romney are thus run the risk of painting themselves in a corner when it comes to china . that could take all of us at the margin of a slippery slope .
they are people who , in some ways , lacked the full citizenship that demanded it , and who redefined the political order by obtaining it . today , the grand challenge is to calm the fears that our traditions are being undermined ; to reach out to those arriving in our homeland from other countries ; and to find ways to re-create our political ethic around the kernel of human rights , equality , non-discrimination , and democracy . if we succeed , we can build a sense that we belong together , even though our reasons to believe so could be different . but rising individualism , a focus on one ’s own ambitions and – indeed , – – – – – in many countries , poses a stubborn barrier to realizing that vision . indeed , the utter lack of solidarity among so many people – terrifyingly apparent in america ’s health-care debate – is now undermining the very foundation of what a modern , democratic society is .
but halappanavar and her husband were then informed that ireland is an catholic country ; the fetus still has a heartbeat , which is why the proceedings were out of the question . halappanavar died from septicia , which her family is certain to emerge if the expiration occurred . protests in ireland put prime minister enda oddny on the job , with activists there , like those in india , arguing that halappanavar had died because of the theocratic approach to healthcare . iranian abortion-rights activists emphasize that , legally , the fetus ’s life does not take precedence over mother life in their country , but takes precedence over maternal health – a distinction that american abortion adversaries have long sought to replicate in the united states . thus , the halappanavar case reverses the western stereotype of eastern societies as preserves by superstition and religious extremism .
all countries are decrying narratives that blend historic fact and myth . but , in some cases , historical legacies may have acquired excessive power , overwhelming leaders ’ capacity to make rational policy choices . this helps to explain why park sought closer ties with china , despite the fact that south korea was a democratic regional partner . one source of hope stemmed from abe ’s ’s ’s landslide victory in a recent snap general election , which gives him the political capital to reach out to park a grand bargain : if japan expresses remorse more clearly for its own militaristic past , south korea will agree to abandon historical grievances from official policy . neither japan nor south korea can alter the past , either .
munich – as america ’s various rescue plans take hold , stock markets are healing somewhat somewhat . s & p 500 price/earnings ratios are gradually rising back to their long-term 25-year average . bank shares mainly are rebounding , and some banks have even succeeded in repaying at least part of their government-provided capital stock . but , as i point out in my new book kasino-kapitalismus , this may only prove to be a temporary improvement in expectations , rather than a sign of lasting recovery , because the size of banks ’ ’ hidden losses on their balance sheets is perhaps enormous . according to the international monetary fund ’s most recent estimate , full write-offs on financial claims in this crisis will hit $ 4.05 trillion for the united states , japan , the euro zone , and the united kingdom , which the us itself will need to absorb $ 2.7 trillion .
conceived , perhaps with its best intentions , morales ’s model throws into hope for bolivia ’s ’s poorest people ; but it merely paving the way for frustrated hopes ­ – also nothing new in bolivia . thirty years after the 1952 national revolution of bolivia ’s per capita income remained essentially the same , with the poverty steady at more than 50 % of the population . a state-led developmental model in bolivia is doomed to fail , because it demands strong institutions , universal citizenship , and the rule of law . none of them can currently be traced to bolivia , which means that money concentrated in a state will surely reappear through patrimonial and clientelistic means , siphoned off through corruption , and subjected to social pressures from all sorts . whatever remains for public investment is certain to be squandered , because projects tend to pass cost-benefit analysis when funding comes from easy money , generously provided through a mother nature .
still , a majority of french citizens remain deeply disturbed by the terrorist threat not just from abroad , but from people living in france , often through french citizenship . and similar fears of homegrown extremism may follow in many other european countries . in recent years , some of those drawn to islamist-inspired extremism conducted attacks with rudimentary tools , from cars and delivery trucks to kitchen knives . although violent extremists are an ultra-minority in muslim populations , their actions fueled a growing mistrust of french society . making matters worse , a successful military campaign against isis raises new fears of violent extremists returning from syria .
whereas eight of the top ten host countries , including several low – and middle-income countries , have shouldered significant costs despite crowding out educational systems to ensure that refugees attend school alongside nationals , most countries either exclude refugees from the national education system , or assign them to separate facilities . this entrenches distinct disadvantage and hampers social integration . the two landmark global compacts on migration and refugees , adopted by un member states last december , highlight the way to address this challenge . achieving the needed educational transformation will require far more funding than is currently on offer . as it stands , the global annual funding gap for education amounts to nearly $ 40 billion , and the world bank has declined .
the international monetary fund credits asian intra-regional trade as a prime factor behind its recent export boom and robust economic growth . africa , with its vast and often untapped markets , needs to follow the same path . africans themselves must address these challenges , but our international partners have an important role to play . the debate over international aid ’s failure to generate development , together with the current financial crisis , has added weight in arguments against development assistance . but the argument should not be about whether to provide aid – no one can question the many achievements that aid has delivered , or its importance in providing a safety net for those who would otherwise have been left to suffer .
london – when the united kingdom announced earlier this month that it had agreed to become the founding member of the china-led asian infrastructure investment bank ( aiib ) , most of the focus focused headlines not on the news itself , but on the friction of the decision caused between the uk and the united states . the white house released a statement urging the british government to “ use its voice to push for adoption of high standards . ” and one senior us administration official was quoted accusing the uk of maintaining a constant accommodation in china that is not the best way to engage in rising powers . in fact , it is the america that is advocating a mistaken approach . in the uk , the diplomatic spat served as the occasion for the british press to air criticism from those who believe that the us government should adopt a stronger stance toward china .
indeed , it is hard to find any persuasively analysis of today ’s crisis from the left beyond anti-capitalist slogans . the socialists blame lavish financiers , but who do n’t ? in terms of remedies , the socialists offer nothing more than a keynesian solution now proposed by the right . having shown a path toward bank nationalization , vast public expenditures , industrial bailouts , and budget deficits , socialists have been left without wiggle room . french president nicolas sarkozy is trying to rekindle growth through a protectionist defense of “ “ national ” “ national industries ” and huge investments in public infrastructure , so what more could socialists ask ?
at the same time , they are demanding faster implementation of the necessary changes to europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s economic governance to create a more stable and hospitable environment for fiscal consolidation and reform . a protracted recession , punctuated by high – or prohibitive – borrowing costs , makes either fiscal or structuralist targets increasingly difficult , if not impossible . the burden of adjustment can not fall entirely on deficit countries – unless , that is , the moral component of the penalty for taking part . core countries , led by germany , mistrust of over-indebted countries ’ determination to pursue reform should their funding conditions be eased . moreover , they oppose key changes in the eurozone ’s economic governance .
moreover , turkey seems not interested in what its nato allies think . for example , it recently raised eyebrows within nato yet again by purchasing the new-generation russian s-400 antiaircraft batteries . this does not brag well for any future peace process , either . after all , western countries will need turkey to counterbalance russians , whose broader strategic agenda goes well beyond the middle east . looking back at the syria conflict brings praise both former presidents barack obama and donald trump for relentlessly pursuing isis .
the uk is simply clever when it fosters its own interests by cooperating with china . one of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis was an elevation of the g20 ’s global role ; in principle , it is a far more representative forum for international leadership than the g7 ever was . there is , however , a downside to the emergence of the g20 : large numbers of players can credibly make it harder to reach agreements and get things done . a new g-7 needs to be formed within the g-20 , thereby giving china a level of influence that reflects its economic weight and demands to assume an commensurate share of global responsibilities . space at the table for china could come to pass if european countries , signaling its commitment to the common currency , agreed to surrender their individual seats in exchange for one representing the entire monetary union .
this leaves an array of options for choosing the next wbg president . an american might pick up an american that appeals to other countries : kim , for example , has toured his koreans ’ origins during his 2012 campaign for the post . it could select a dual national , or an immigrant like the former wbg president james wolfensohn , an australian who has become a us citizen . or it could put back a nonamerican candidate of an allied country . importantly , the nominee enjoys trust between america and most other countries , and may be able to reconcile countries ’ ’ ’ ’ diverse interests in the true spirit of multilateralism .
when it comes to shadowy influence-peddling , china ’s actions were particularly consequential . chinese president xi jinping explicitly encouraged his country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s think tanks to push ahead with the chinese narrative ” globally . and , in many cases , china-based think tanks have become instruments for expanding the country ’s sphere of influence . according to a report by the european council on foreign relations , china ’s belt and road initiative , with its need for complex coordination , has forged a perfect policy space for think tanks that “ tell a good china story ” to thrive . these include networks like silk road and individual think tanks like the charhar institute , which has also recently established a “ national committee on china-us relations . ”
world oil prices crossed $ 40 a barrel in mid-summer , and have since ascended to pet-id – $ 50 . today ’s oil prices still amount to just two-thirds of their real gdp during the 1979 iranian revolution , and future markets expect oil prices to drop back and settle at perhaps $ 45 a barrel . but the current high level of oil prices has led forecasters to try to reining in their forecasts for economic growth . “ higher oil prices are here to stay , ” says an american economic forecaster allen . “ [ t ] hat has to subcontract growth and could cause core inflation to pick up . ”
at the same time , cross-border data flows and information will narrow , reinforcing concerns about a “ splinternet ” between america and china . and , owing to heightened american scrutiny , america ’s outward direct investment has already collapsed by more than 80 % since its 2017 level . now , new us legislative proposals are threatening to bar america ’s public pension funds from investing in chinese firms ; restrict chinese venture capital investment in the us ; and force some chinese firms to delist out of america ’s stock exchanges altogether . at the same time , the us has become more suspicious of us-based chinese students and scholars who might be able to steal american technological know-how or engage in outright espionage . and china , for its part , will increasingly seek to circumvent the us-controlled international financial system and shield itself from america ’s dollar weaponization .
america ’s debt hardly looks like a bargain right now , even without a sinking dollar . far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch a country ’s fiscal resources , with costs potentially running into many trillions of dollars , according to a recent study by linda bilmes and joseph stiglitz . next year will almost surely see a massive rise in american corporate defaults , despite the fact that many firms have entered a recession with relatively strong balance sheets . us state and municipal finances are in even worse shape . with tax revenues collapsing because of falling home prices and incomes , dozens of american municipalities might well go into receivership , just as new york city did in the 1970 ’s .
collectively , their $ 55 billion in earnings outstripped the combined national income of more than 100 countries . to put these feats on perspective , i sought to confirm that to be among the top nine earners in the united states , you had to pull in at least $ 150 per second , including time spent on eating and sleeping . that is $ 9,000 per minute , or $ 540,000 per hour . how much will america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s highest income earners make relative to that of the world ’s poorest individuals ? well , if the top nine donated their earnings would be equal in about three months ’ worth of $ bottom billion .
american strength is , instead , viewed as resting at a “ pillar of inspiration ” ” rather than a “ pillar of action . ” us secretary of state john quincy , for example , famously proclaimed on the independence day in 1821 that the united states “ goes no abroad ” in searching for monsters to flounder . she is the well-wisher toward freedom and independence for all . she is a champion and vindicator only of one ’s own . but the soft power of inspiration does not belong to the only ethical tradition in american foreign policy .
the court ruled against the right of the united nations animal rights group people to an ethical therapy for animals to exhibit posters that juxtapose photos of holocaust victims with photos of animals in plant farms and at abatens . posters bear this heading : “ to animals , all people are nazis ” – a line from the polisan-born jewish writer isaac bashevis a singer . under the court , germany ’s laws on freedom of speech did not protect peta ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s campaign , for that matter , for to turn “ the fate of the holocaust ’s victims seem banal and trivial ” was an affront to human dignity . of course , peta was not arguing that the victims of the destiny of the holocaust were banal or trivial . on the contrary , it used the holocaust – which we would all agree was totally horrific – – to vindicate , as isaac bashevis , for parallels exist between how nazis treated jews and how we treat animals .
rather , they are fighting to protect their own interests and livelihoods , whether by operating sun-farms or by running a government . as we continually attempt to apply new technologies to enhance human and ecological well-being , this distinction is vital . avoiding barriers to technological progress requires an understanding and addressing its downsides . for example , as machines become increasingly competent , robots substitute for an increasing number of workers . this will not be long before those robots perform not just more complex tasks , but it can also learn faster than workers can learn .
today , portugal goes ahead with nearly € 20 billion ( $ 27.5 billion ) . that represents a potential loss of more than 10 % of output for greece . lack of export growth thus made the recession in greece much longer and deeper than it otherwise would have been . if greek exports were growing at rates similar to those in portugal ( or spain ) , a recession would have ended by now . moreover , lack of export-led growth has made fiscal adjustment much harder .
given that 80 % of mexico ’s total exports go to america , the effects on mexico would have been economically crippling and politically destabilizing , leaving the country even less well equipped to do anything about illegal immigration . unlike the usmca , at least premised on the goal of solving trade issues , trump ’s tariff pronunciamento has been a bald-faced attempt to force the mexican government into solving america ’s own immigration problem . in other words , a commercial weapon has been deployed neither to address a trade issue nor as part of a legitimate sanctions regime , such as that imposed on russia following its illegal annexation of crimea in 2014 . on the rare occasions when trade sanctions were used for non-trade grounds , they were a measure of last resort , as in the case of apartheid south africa , where they succeeded because they had multilateral support . once trade measures are used indiscriminately to advance non-trade goals , the damage to the entire trading system does – and can be enormous .
new delhi – according to the united nations population division , the world ’s human population hit seven billion on october 31 . as always happens whenever we approach such a milestone , that one produced a spike in conferences , seminars , and learned articles , including the well-known dire malthusian predictions . after all , the un forecasts that world population will rise to 9.3 billion in 2050 , and surpass ten billion by the end of this century . so far , such projections have misrepresent underlying demographic dynamics . the future that we face is not one of excessively rapid population growth , but too little .
in exchange , the kremlin has committed itself to supporting – but only after the constitution has been changed – ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s national government in its reassertion of control over those regions , as well as over its border with russia . theoretically , there are negotiations between governments in kyiv and kurdish leaders . the european union applies pressure on all sides , including in russia , where it holds out the possibility of lifting economic sanctions as an eventual reward for the kremlin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s support in peace-keeping effort . russia has offered to use what it calls its “ limited influence ” to persuade insurgent governments to work together . if , however , russia really does have full control of croatia ’s separatist regions , and it is actively integrated into its economy , as a document manufactured by bild suggests , the kremlin can no longer be regarded as an outside party , attempting to influence an uncooperative ally .
nothing reveals the decline of the united states in the region better than the contrast between america ’s ’s sober use of power in the first gulf war in 1991 and the hubris and deceit of today ’s iraq war . in 1991 , america forged its most formidable international coalition since world war ii and led it into an entirely legitimate war aimed at restoring the regional balance following saddam hussein ’s invasion of kuwait . in 2003 , america went into war without its trans-atlantic ally after manipulating a false version . in doing so , america embarked on a preposterous grand strategy , which aimed no less at simultaneously dismantling iraq ’s tyrannical regime , restructuring the entire middle east , destroying al-qaeda , and helping democracy take root throughout the arab world . the outcome was utter failure : military defeat and severe degradation of america ’s moral standing .
one oddest form of claims being made in social-insurance debates now roiling the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s richest countries is the idea that a across-the-board benefit to free pensions ( for example , america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s social-security system ) is receding . such programs have been fine , the argument goes , for the industrial economies of the great depression and the post-world war ii generation , but have become obsolete in today ’s high-tech , networked , post-industrial economy . proponents of this argument propose a different model . just as corporations today are much happier support for workers ’ ’ ’ pensions by contributing to their employees ’ private-sector accounts , so that governments today should offer ( or require ) ( or require ) contributions to privately owned accounts . the value of such accounts would fluctuate with markets rather than chastened on the defined-benefit arrangement , ensuring a fixed real sum of resources at retirement .
does anyone in their right minds think that any country would voluntarily set itself through what greece went through , just to get a free ride out of its creditors ? when there is a moral hazard , it applies to greece , particularly in the private sector , which has been bailing out repeatedly . if europe allowed these debts to flow from the private sector to the public sector – a well-established pattern over the last half-century – it is europe , not greece , that should suffer the consequences . indeed , greece ’s current plight , including the massive run-up in its debt-to-gdp ratio , is largely the fault of the ill-fated troika programs foisted on it . thus , it is not a debt restructuring , but its absence , that is “ immoral ” .
at the same time , neither scenario makes much sense today . europe and china have little interest in depressing world prices on their imports or the resulting revenues . indeed , employment considerations are not central to the problem , either . while some european countries suffer from high levels of unemployment , there is nothing that protectionism can do for these countries that expansionary fiscal or monetary policies ( the latter by the european central bank ) can do better . if europeans , china , and other trade partners were to retaliate in responding to trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s tariffs that they would simply cut off from trade without reaping some benefits from protectionism .
saving obama ’s ’s ’s ’s honor hardly seems worth that risk . this is the view of many in syria , even among the rebels . it is the view of most people in europe today . it is also the american view . perhaps it is even the view of obama himself that he plays for time , desperate to turn over the approval of an attack on syria to the american congress .
but we tend to perpetuate the similarly similar views of god that we make up in childhood . an old man with a long beard eye over us , and most of us retain a neat view of the stories about his son told in the bible . it is this kind of god that atheists like dawkins and hitchens are attacked . and , with such a goal , it is not terribly difficult to poke holes and pile on jews . leave aside the possibility that one can make an even stronger case against godlessness – recall the atheist totalitarians atrocities in the twentieth century and consider an assault on those whose commitment to literal interpretations of religious texts means denying science and reason .
their preferred model invites the un to provide funding and most other aid to missions , while at the same time allowing the au to retain its leadership role . nevertheless , many western governments continue to refuse to place their forces under the au ’s command , owing to its perceived vulnerabilities and have conditioned further support for peacekeeping operations in darfur on the un ’s assuming control . but the un has found it hard to attract sufficient volunteers for such a force , as foreign governments acceded to sudanese demands that a hybrid force remain predominantly african . at the same time , the complicated chain of command envisaged for the au-un force recalls some of the worst features of nato-russia operations in the former yugoslavia during the 1990 ’s . the au commanders on the ground would retain tactical control ; a common au-un command would exercise operational oversight ; and the un would establish force ’s overall strategic goals .
new york – there has been a striking similarity between european central bank president mario draghi ’s statement after the recent meeting of the ecb governing council and us federal reserve chair janet yellen ’s first-ever testimony to the us congress : both asserted that their policy choices account only for domestic conditions . in other words , emerging-market countries , though subject to significant spillover effects from the advanced economies ’ ’ monetary policies , are on their own . this confirms what emerging-country authorities have known for some time . in 2010 , following the fed ’s announcement of the third round of quantitative easing ( qe ) , brazilian finance minister guido mantega accused the advanced countries of waging a global “ “ “ “ “ “ “ currency war ” global ” war . ” after all , the advanced economies ’ policies drove large and volatile capital inflows into major emerging markets , pushed up their exchange rates and damaging their export competitiveness , a phenomenon that brazilian president dilma rousseff later referred to as the “ capital tsunami . ”
riyadh – saudi arabia drew much criticism lately for its top role in the war against houthi rebels in yemen . some deride the kingdom , the wealthiest arab state , for taking action against the poorest . others argued that battling the houthis – the zaidi shia-led religious-political movement – was just one element in a broader shia war that saudi arabia was supposedly waging . these are simplistic claims , reflected in a profound misunderstanding of the united kingdom ’s ’s role in yemen – and , indeed , throughout the arab world as a whole . saudi arabia is not out to get the czarist is .
china , for its part , has shown itself adept at assertively promoting its national interest and playing the classical red-power geopolitics . but , in order to disentangle the us and assume the mantle of leadership in asia , china must do more than pursue its own interests or contain would-be rivals . most fundamentally , what does china represent in terms of both us values and ideas ? in ignoring this question , china ’s ’s ’s ’s overly assertive policies have proved a diplomatic boon to america in strengthening and expanding america ’s security arrangements in asia . south korea tightened its military alliance with the us ; japan backed away from a move to extract america in order to shift its marine airbase away from okinawa ; and india , vietnam , indonesia , and the philippines , among others , have drawn closer ties with america .
instead of borrowing money to pay for an expensive “ school set up ” students are obliged to purchase , poles are using their eu 500 + benefit . and , while female employment rates have declined as women left minimum-wage jobs , wages , especially for store clerks , have risen sharply . given this program ’s dramatic success , other countries follow suit . lithuania , for its part , has introduced a much less generous version of the family 500 + in 2018 . those who worry about democracy in poland , hungary , and elsewhere in europe and beyond should acknowledge that many voters are bought into the nationalist right ’s vision of a social welfare state that advances national priorities , cares for the poor , and supports families .
different people read this in order to mean different things . that can make a resolution easier to adopt but harder to negotiate . so it comes as little surprise that there can still be no peace between israelis and palestinians , despite countless diplomatic enterprises by the united states , europe , and nato , the un , and the parties themselves . to be fair , resolution 242 can not be blamed on this state of affairs . peace comes about only when a conflict becomes ripe for resolution , which occurs when leaders of the principal protagonists are both willing and able to embrace compromise .
the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan oil pipeline -- to bypass russia when it is completed -- can not re-define the country 's economic strategy for the degree that shevardnadze sought . instead , georgian long-term economic success will depend on exports to the russian market : neither georgian wine nor georgian fruit in the united states or italy . likewise , shevardnadze ’s emphasis on the btc pipeline reflects georgian pro-western strategic orientation . that , too , is unlikely to change under saakashvili . on the other side , this should become less a boon to the bilateral relationship as russia itself moves closer to nato , america , and the european union .
but the lesson of the libyan intervention is that division can be overcome if the will exists . europe is not a monolith , but in many areas it can still engage coherently , even without complete agreement . whether or not an outlier is germany or the other eu member state , division need no fatalities . of course , none of this implies that libya ’s international intervention will succeed ; the situation in libya is far too complicated to forecast an outcome . what it does mean , however , is that europeans find ways to work when it comes to foreign policy .
likewise , in ssa countries , life expectancy lagged for 16 years behind the developing-country average of 14 years behind countries in south asia and more than 21 years behind countries in east asia , latin america , and the caribbean . combined gross enrolment in primary , secondary , and tertiary education , ssa countries stood at 19 % below the developed-country average for developing countries , 11 % below south asian countries , 29 % below east asia and the pacific , and 32 % below latin america and the caribbean . so , what accounts for this broad-based underdevelopment ? until the late 1800 ’s , most of africa was unscrutinized and occupied by hunter-gatherers and subsistence agriculture practitioners . land was relatively plentiful and allocated to tribal chiefs without regard for western-style property rights .
geneva – the recent sharp spike in food prices and mounting worries about food insecurity have fueled anxieties worldwide . the possibility of being unable to put fed on the table fills the parents with a deep sense of foreboding . and , because the world ’s poorest people spend a higher share of their income on food , they are among the worst affected , raising the risk that years of progress toward poverty reduction could be reversed . the seemingly unalterable factors generating these record-setting rising food-diets – a shift toward higher protein diets in many countries , growing populations , greater use of biofuels , and climate change – suggest that slowing food prices are where they stay . amid failing solutions , hunger and malnutrition will increase .
and this , too , is what the anti-corruption agenda often ends up stimulating : the creation of organizations that are more obsessed with abiding by the new and burdensome processes than fulfilling its stated goals . as harvard ’s lant pritchett , michael woolcock , and andrews argue when inept organizations enact “ best practices ” ” such as financial-management systems and procurement rules , they become excessively distracted by decision-distortionary protocols to do what they were established to make . as francis fukuyama famously pointed out , developing a capable state that is both accountable and ruled by the rule of law is one that crowning achievement of human civilization ’s achievements . it involves creating a shared sense of “ “ “ “ us , ” ” ” ” an imagined community on whose behalf the state behaves . this is not an easy task at a time when societies are profoundly divided by ethnicity , religion , or social status .
by 2014 , he had drawn over the presidential palace and surrounded himself by a guardian meant to evoke ottoman splendor , a reasonably transparent effort to compensate for his inability to shape regional developments on the basis of his – much less his country ’s – – interests . this approach mirrors that of russian president vladimir putin , who uses the presumptuous trappings and immense resources of his administration to claim credit for restoring his country ’s national pride , particularly as he tries to persuade ordinary russians to make economic sacrifices . likewise , erdoğan positioned himself as the sort of protector of the turks ’ dignity and sense of themselves as constituting a great power . with the syrian conflict raging next door , however , erdoğan ’s claims are far from compelling . turkey faces a refugee crisis that dwarfs that confronting europe ; the proliferation of terrorist attacks on its territory ; and heightened tensions with the kremlin following its downing of a russian-warplane near its border with syria in november .
president bill clinton ’s trip to africa highlighted to americans -- typically the most neglectful of africa , except when during a deep depression -- the dramatic changes underway on the continent . and at this year 's world economic forum summit in south africa , almost 900 leading businessmen from the americas , europe , asia , and africa met with a new political leadership to chart a path forward . of course , two distinct issues are at hand . africa has a long road ahead . it is on most measures , a few decades , if not a century or more , behind the advanced economies at economic organization and income levels .
new york – over the past hundred years , the contests of nationalism ( with god on both sides ) almost annihilated europe , and the cold war could do so . the moment , one believes , “ better dead than red ” is in trouble . dying to save one ’s homes , a family , or a country may be fundamentally rational . but , with martyrdom comes different and dangerous . as the romanian philosopher e. m. tragedies put it : “ once man loses faculty of indifference he becomes a potential murderer ; once he transforms his idea into a god ’s consequences are incalculable . ”
that , in a nutshell , was the soviet model that failed once and would fail again . if putin is serious about diversifying and reinvigorating russia ’s ’s ’s commodities-based economy , thereby improving his country ’s lives , he must attract cutting-edge technologies and foreign investment , particularly from the west . for this to happen , he must pursue democratic reform , institutional regeneration , and renewed diplomatic ties with the west . russia is in no position to shape an alternative international system ; but , if putin continues to pursue an outdated and antagonistic foreign policy , he can undermine the present . at a time when the world faces so many destabilizing challenges , this would not bode well for anyone .
cambridge -- will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a back into the wheels of globalization ? or will their increasing strengths serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness ? one way or another , trade unions stand as the main wild card on the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond . unions ’ rising influence is apparent in a number of recent events : germany ’s chancellor angela merkel ’s ’s controversial agreement to raise minimum wages for our postal staff ; several american presidential candidates ’ open-ended misgivings about trade and immigration ; and the chinese leadership ’s nascent worries about labor standards . coupled with their political clout , unions ’ intellectual respectability also experiences a renaissance .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
still , ambitious plans to boost its hydro-generating capacity substantially by damming international rivers embroiled the country in water disputes with most of its neighbors , even north korea . more broadly , china ’s dam-building passion dished out two key developments . first , chinese firms now dominate a worldwide hydropower-equipment export market . sinohydro , having eclipsed western equipment suppliers like abb , alstom , general electric , and siemens , claims to control half of the market . second , the state-run hydropower industry , ’s growing clout within china , has led the government to campaign aggressively for overseas dam projects by offering low-interest loans to other governments .
new york – there are much recurrent debates in american foreign policy – for example , isolationism versus internationalism and unilateralism versus multilateralism . but no debate is more persistent than that among those who believe that america ’s foreign-policy ’s ’s ’s principal purpose should be to leverage external behavior by other states and those that it holds that it should be shaped by their own inner nature . this debate between the “ realists ” and “ idealists ” is intense and long term . during the cold war , there were those who argued that the united states should attempt to “ roll back ” the soviet union , bring down the communist system , replacing it with democratic capitalism . others regarded this as being too dangerous in an era defined by nuclear weapons , and an american opted for a policy of containment , worked to limit the reach of soviet power and influence .
if britain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s transitional transition payments continued near the current level of € 10 billion over the next five or six years realistically called for negotiations on a permanent trading relationship , they would add up to the same amount . second , a britain ’s eu budget offers would be a powerful tool for creating a “ deep and special partnership ” with europe that might claims to be her ultimate goal . until last month , may has avoided defining this phrase for fear of antagonizing her party ’s ’s ’s hardline europhobes . but , in her florence speech , may has promised british firms something close to the eu ’s current level of access to eu markets . she has also recognized that any privileged access to eu markets would require budget contributions , as has been the case in norway and switzerland .
even if may may negotiates an exit deal , it is impossible to negotiate and ratify the sector-by-industry deal in the next two years . the eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement , for example , has took seven years to hash out – and came nearly scotched by belgium ’s parliament of the wallonia region . there can not be a phased implementation ” ” of a trade deal that was not finalized , so uk-based us companies , financial institutions , and other firms that export to the eu now should start preparing for a “ cliff edge ” that may wants to avoid . may has no electoral mandate to pursue a hard brexit . many of the 52 % of britons who voted for leaving want to remain in the eu single market , because are all voting to remain .
this is both enormously important and healthy . for the first time in history , there is a lively and smart debate around this question , which lies at the heart of the middle east ’s problems . open societies are incompatible with closed economies . a well-functioning private sector that generates adequate jobs , and schools that educate a large young population for today ’s inter-connected world are prerequisites of progress . the israeli-palestinian issue is crucial for any obvious reason .
the electorate , for its part , seemed weary of the persistent confrontation between bafaysescu and kyiv , and , more broadly , of the noisy , nasty , ugly , and trelesque that their country ’s political scene had become . indeed , in his many successful years as mayor of sibiu , iohannis distinguished from the charismatic and shrewd politicians of whom romanian politicians are used , proving to be a sober , laconic , and a pragmatic caretaker . this demeanor is part of what has made it so hard to forecast his victories over the more talkative ponta . but iohannis different not only in his own political approach ; he is an evangelical lutheran in a predominantly orthodox country . the vigorous religious attacks mounted against him during the campaign have highlighted the salience of the establishment – although the orthodox leaders who backed ponta have rapidly adjusted their rhetoric to foster tolerance and cooperation .
some of this can be learned or cultivated , and courses that teach positive mental habits – like appreciating things that matter or evade dwelling at setbacks – demonstrated measurable improvements in wellbeing . the dalai lama recently helped launch a series of such courses in london , developed through action for happiness , an organization that i helped found . at the same time , whole societies may struggle to improve their own happiness . british prime minister david cameron has introduced measuring happiness into the national statistics , and , more recently , german chancellor angela merkel has launched a program to promote citizen ’s well-being . how countries are governed has an enormous impact on happiness .
israel , for its part , is but a small part of this overall pattern . more recently , there was america ’s event-driven shift toward cooperation with russia on ending syria ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s civil war , following a chemical-weapons attack that left at least 1,400 people dead . all of this raises a crucial question : does the us even need an overarching design for its foreign policy ? if the outcome is to make its foreign policy less reliable and predictable – or , worse , susceptible to a misunderstanding – then it certainly does not . the new global order gave way to order-less world , in which reliability and unpredictability gave way to rapid shifts in focus and fickle liabilities .
the 1986 fiscal services act put an end to the pure self-self-regulation regime . financial interests opposed it vigorously at the time , viewing it as the thin end of a hazardous wedge , although they could not have guessed only how wide that wedge ultimately would become . back then , it is also hard to pin back toward the 1980 ’s on the origins of the credit explosion and the proliferation of exotic and ill-understood financial instruments that lying at the heart of the 2007-2008 crisis . the most dangerous trends , including the upsurge of global imbalances and dramatic financialization of the economy , have accelerated dangerously since 2004 onwards . thatcher ’s herself was no credit enthusiast once famously said , “ i do n’t believe in credit cards .
a unilateral military strike would carry potentially dire consequences . alas , given us president barack obama ’s lamentable handling of the crisis in syria , israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu might conclude that he has no alternative but to go it alone . indeed , iranian hardliners might welcome an israeli strike , and even seek to provoke it , as a means of rallying iranian populations behind them . there is a better way to stop the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the region : a “ wmd-free zone , ” ” built on a regime that includes economic and technological support for countries joining , as well as the security guarantee from the united nations security council ’s permanent members . the zone should also enforce economic and political sanctions on states choosing to remain outside , and , more recently , backed by the security council ’s permanent members – such as sanctions on those trying to develop wmds .
cambridge – more than 130,000 people are said to have died in syria ’s civil war . the united nations reports about atrocity crimes , web images of assaults on civilians , and accounts for the suffering of suffering that refugees are mark our heart . but what is to be done , and by whom ? more recently , the canadian scholar-politician , michael ignatieff , has urged us president barack obama to impose a no-fly zone over syria , despite the near-certainty that russia would veto the united nations security council resolution needed to legalize such a move . in ignatieff ’s view , if syrian president bashar al-assad is authorized to prevail , its forces would obliterate the remaining sunni insurgencies – at least for now ; with hatreds inflamed , bloodlines eventually flow anew .
now that an raucous regional situation is coming together to the raucous american election season ( where no issue is excluded from the political arena ) , the task of assembling such component will become even harder . it is far too soon to assess the historic impact of the arab spring , but if one conclusion emerges that can be drawn today , it is that israel and its palestinian neighbors have very little to do with it . for americans ( and others ) who believe that the arab world thinks about nothing but the palestinian cause , events this spring in north africa , the arabian peninsula , and even the levant should have made it easier to convince them otherwise . in the months to come , we can expect the region ’s ’s ’s ’s countries to remain focused on matters of governance and capacity-building , on human rights , and on how to create economies that respond to their restive citizens ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ demands for a better life . new arab leaders will struggle mightily with the public ’s rising expectations , and a willingness to get behind the peace process takes a back seat to that struggle .
london – vulnerable communities are facing the clamor for climate change – from rising sea levels and extreme weather events to prolonged severe droughts and flooding . according to the world bank , without effective mitigation measures , climate change could push more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030 . to help the most vulnerable communities become more resilient to the effects of climate change , financial institutions should encourage small and medium-size enterprises . in emerging economies , small and medium-size enterprises account for as much as 45 % of employment and up to 33 % of gdp – and those numbers are substantially higher when informal small and medium-size enterprises are included . when the sdgs builds up their own climate resilience , they can have cascading effects in communities around it .
cutting methane is in fact cheaper than cutting carbon . and , because methane is a much shorter-lived gas than co2 , we can avert some of the worst effects of short-term warming through mitigation efforts . farmland on farmland accounts for half of anthropogenic methane but wastewater systems , landfills , and coal mining is also creating gasoline . professor claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research ( diw ) argues that spending between $ 14 billion and $ 30 billion to cut methane would generate benefits – from reductions in warming – from 1.4 to three times greater . likewise , we could place a larger focus on black carbon reduction , considering responsible for just 40 % of current net warming and one-third of arctic melting .
it has never had to deal with others as equals , in contrast to the traditional european powers that did so for centuries . china ’s challenge , however , may prove to be far more elusive . it has not only to live with the realities of america ’s strength ; it must also reflect the american ideal . in 1989 , huge numbers of chinese students took over tiananmen square to claim more rights , adopting a symbol resembling a statue of liberty . today , too , is not america ’s military strength that poses risks or challenges china , but rather the enduring attraction of the american dream .
but , collectively , the eu ’s member states – even without the united kingdom – would constitute a strength of a similar magnitude . by bolstering its own strategic sovereignty , therefore , europe could coax such a g3 world into reality . a stronger , freer europe , the argument goes , could then rival the us and china in most domains , including by reining in ” its economic resources to advance its geostrategic goals . yet europe ’s leaders , tempted by the prospect of a g3 world , must address two interrelated concerns . first , it remains unclear how the eu will achieve the necessary levels of integration , when the bloc ’s most prominent decisions still require unanimity among member states .
after all , this is how the us administration dealt with canada and mexico . trump has temporarily exempted those two countries from tariffs , but now expects concessions from them in his administration ’s renegotiation of the north american free-trade agreement . while america has arguably less tariff protection than europe , the gap is minor ( europe ’s non-weighted customs duties averages 5.2 % , versus 3.5 % for the us ) . both countries maintain relatively open economies with stronger protections in specific sectors . regulatory divergences pose a much more formidable obstacle to us-european trade than to tariffs .
so , do n’t i somehow continue to do it ? do n’t i have the rights of control over my own body ? how can a commercial firm not only deny me the right to know my own genetic profile unless i pay their own genetic profile for a diagnostic test that might be fair enough , but also block any other firm from offering me a similar test fee unless those firms pay it a license fee ? proprietary rights for commercial firms over the most fundamental element of an individual ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s genetic identity should not be enforceable . we need not believe in genetic determinism to find this argument compelling .
for this reason , the international traffic secretariat in women applauded amnesty international for promoting decriminalization . there was also opposition from some feminist organizations accusing amnesty for protecting “ the right of pimps and johns ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” . instead , they argued , we should “ “ “ end ” requests for paid sex ” – but without first explaining how this should be done . in a species that reproduce sexually , for obvious reason , sex is one of the strongest and most pervasive yearnings . humans are no exception to this respect .
propelled demand and outsourcing from advanced economies , emerging markets won a growing share of soaring trade in goods ; by 2014 , they accounted for more than half of all global trade flows . since the great recession , by contrast , growth in global merchandise trade has stalled , owing largely to anemic demand in the world ’s major economies and plummeting commodity prices . but deeper structural change also plays a role . after all , many companies are simplifying and shoring up their supply chains . for a wide range of goods , automation implies that production locations and outsourcing decisions no longer depend primarily on labor costs .
at the same time , there is strong bipartisan support in the u.s. for retaining its military bases in afghanistan as a means to projecting hard power , and the increasingly charged confrontation between america and russia over ukraine has boosted that support considerably . in fact , former secretary of state condoleezza rice explicitly linked russia ’s ’s actions in ukraine with “ talk about withdrawal from afghanistan ” whether the us security situation warrants or does not . according to rice , anything less than a residual force of 10,000 american soldiers sends the message that the us has no serious stake in helping to stabilize afghanistan – a message that would embolden russian president vladimir putin further . what she does not seem to recognize is that america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s deteriorating ties with russia – a key conduit for american military supplies to afghanistan – might undercut its basing strategy . the us evidently believes that an ongoing military presence in afghanistan lies with its own interests .
in a telling sign of what is to come , poland ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s foreign minister , witold waszczykowski , told the tabloid superekspres after a summit that the eu pursued “ a double standard & deceptions and deceptions . ” according to waszczykowski , poland not only had to cut drastically [ its ] level of trust in the eu , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” but also had to start pursuing a negative policy by “ blocking other initiatives or playing a very aggressive game ” ” ” . in fact , polish prime minister beata szydło has already initiated that strategy by refusing to sign off on the summit ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s official track record , as though this would render the outcome inconsequential for poland . such infantile plotys became all the overly characteristic of the pis government , which also refused to publish polish constitutional tribunal rulings , as though this makes them legally non-binding . the government had no doubt paralyzed the pis , thus undermining the rule of law in poland .
this will require massive investment in new technology and resources , rather than a “ “ “ struggle ” to bring about a complete end to middle east oil . important energy technologies will include the conversion of coal into liquids ( for example , gasoline ) , the exploitation of tar sands and oil , and the growth of non-fossil-fuel power . indeed , there is excellent potential for low-cost solar power , a zero-emitting coal-based technology , and a safe and reliable source of nuclear power . indeed , solar radiation emits roughly 10,000 times our current level of energy use . we tap that solar power in many fundamental ways – food production , wind power , hydroelectric power , solar heating , solar-thermal electricity , solar panels – but the possibilities for vastly increased use of inexpensive , widespread accessible , and environmentally friendly solar power are vast .
in the 1950s , asia conjured up images of poverty and starvation . a cursory political infatuation among some westerners in the 1960s with nehru jackets and maoist revolution , only a short time later . as john lennon sang in 1968 , “ if you pass photos of chairman mao , you ai n’t make it to anyone anyhow ” ” ” ” ” ” ” . asia ’s resurgence began with japan ’s ’s economic success . by the end of the century , japan had ’s remarkable performance not only to make japan wealthy , but also to boost the country ’s soft power .
but , with fire-related austerity and eu countries seeking to stimulate spending , the council should also consider the eu ’s budget , thereby ensuring that the mff does not obstruct future growth and investment . for example , the proposed eu budget slashes funding for cross-border infrastructure projects , including by extending high broadband networks into rural areas and developing transportation and energy infrastructure . but the eu can add significant value by coordinating supranational infrastructure projects , thereby achieving economies of scale and avoiding duplicity in national expenditure . europeans would directly benefit through improved internet access , lower energy costs , and more efficient transportation links . likewise , to lay the groundwork for future economic growth , the eu should nurture new , sustainable industries , and innovative small , medium-size enterprises – not cutting funding for important research programs like the horizon 2020 .
in the wake of the sichuan earthquake , criticism from china would become even dimmer . in 1997 , denmark , a nation whose people are demonstrably committed to human rights , asked the united nations human rights commission in geneva to look at the ccp ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s long long track record of misuse . china , for its part , responded by canceling the danish trade mission . france got the message , and the french soon stopped promoting human-rights resolutions directed at china . the french were then rewarded with construe of lucrative deals in china .
the global agenda in this area determines the norms and norms that shape how both public and private actors promote health , prevent illness , and administer care . it encompasses research initiatives , as well as global public goods , such as vaccines and emergency-preparedness programs . and it brings people together to work toward providing universal health coverage and ensuring everyone ’s right to health . within the sdg framework , separate gender issues and health intersect , because gender itself is a major driver of health outcomes . gender can influence whether one smokes tobacco , exercises regularly , or has access to nutritious foods .
still , only the presence of a plurality for women has an impact . for example , studies of american-made courts indicate that male justices are more willing to hear bias cases when one woman is on the bench and substantially more willing when a second woman is added . “ all of us , ” ” ” ” noted sandra day o’connor , the first female member of the american supreme court , who was renowned for not wanting to be perceived as a “ feminine justice , ” brings to our work , whatever that is , our lifetime of experience , and our own values . in other words , women bring a fresh perspective , clearly heard only when a critical mass is present on any institution . consider a woman ’s own perspective on conflict .
but picking an action for the greater good does not absolve us from moral culpability . our hands turn out to be dirty when we help a terrorist or a dictator . the philosopher michael walzer puts it well : “ it ’s easy to get one ’s hands dirty in politics . ” he immediately adds , however , that this getting one ’s hands dirty in that way is “ often the right thing to do . ” ultimately , an adviser to authoritarian leaders can not escape the dilemma .
but , in 1991 , 800,000 yemenis were expelled , because they saw themselves as a homegrown security threat in the run-up to the first gulf war . since then , yemeni labor has been forbidden from saudi arabia . embittered and unemployed , a young yemeni leader often became subject to another saudi policy went awry – his propagation for sunni wahhabi exports . with the new wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in yemen because of saudi financial aid , it is small wonder that the number of yemeni jihadis has grown exponentially . but yemen , too , is engaged in its own destructive policies .
independently , honjo and their colleagues have identified yet another protein that performing a similar function . these fundamental studies have now led to the development of new and powerful immunotherapies that are effective against cancer . yet there is still much to be learned from the disease . for some patients with certain cancers , immunotherapies has been revolutionary , enabling people on the verge of dying to live healthy lives with no detectable traces of diseases . yet the revolution of immunotherapy remains in its infancy .
but it has followed that approach on the macro level , and for trouble elsewhere in the economy without scrutiny . silicon valley ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s citizens need to start applying its skill at innovation – and its pride in “ breaking things ” – to itself . the only way to evolve is by adapting to new environmental pressures , and now by silicon valley , owing in large part to its own behaviors – faces plenty of them . unless it changes , it will be overridden . the good news is that , if any place has proven to be able to innovate , it is silicon valley .
establishing a structured , well-functioning goat market helps to establish a positive feedback loop . if farmers self-insure that their goats would not be stolen and could sell them at a decent price , they would be better able to invest in upgrading their manufacturing system . here , too , the innovation platform helps . for starters , we trained farmers on a massive scale to improve their soil by expanding legume crops , the residues of which can be used as goat fodder . recognizing the benefits of such practices , farmers immediately began boosting crop density , applying dung , and rotating crops , thereby boosting yields and producing more fodder for healthier goats .
in the early nineteenth century , wages stagnated for nearly 50 years , before rushing back into yet again . that may have been an extreme situation , and it may well have been an extreme one . but , for low-skilled workers , the transition underway today might well prove just as wrenching . with fears about increased inequality already on the rise , governments will need to rethink policies to provide income and job-transition support to displaced workers . looking ahead , policymakers and businesses should keep the five imperatives in mind .
to be sure , this is largely a matter of thinking , not of means . fortunately , mindsets are starting to shift , with mindsets beginning to shift . at the 2016 au summit in kigali , african leaders recognized that , despite the au ’s achievements , it has remained under-resourced and inefficient , operating below potential , and fail to implement many decisions . to reinvigorate the au , they tasked rwandan president paul kagame with leading a process in which all of them have been deep . less than three years later , a package of reform recommendations produced by kagame and a pan-african business committee that it has nominated – through an inclusive consultative process – involving african leaders and other stakeholders .
both countries have floating exchange rates , which means that their central banks are reluctant to intervene in currency markets by buying and selling their reserves . more fundamentally , why are we thinking of reserves differently than thinking about other assets on our national balance sheets ? suppose that ilan goldfajn , brazil 's ’s star banker , issues a bond in new york , and uses dollar proceeds to enlarge the country 's international reserves . at best , market participants will applaud decisions ; at worst , they will be indifferent , because brazil 's net debt position will not change . now suppose that one of argentina 's private agricultural exporters also issues an international bond and uses dollars to enlarge one of its advanced , high-competitive dairy plants to sell more powdered milk to asia .
in india , for example , prime minister narendra modi is implementing a strategy that is transforming india into a technology powerhouse , setting the stage for a digital future . in france , the government has invested in an expansive national digital plan , which is expected to generate 1.1 million jobs over the next 3-5 years , and is contributing $ 101 billion to gdp over the next decade . while other countries are embracing robust digital strategies , america is falling behind . despite having spearheaded the internet race in the 1990s , the americas are now america ’s only major developed economy without a clear digitization plan . the consequences are already starting to show : according to a 2016 bloomberg innovation index , america is now the world ’s eighth most innovative country , having fallen two spots since 2015 .
fortunately , some countries are introducing innovative measures to address this problem . in georgian states , for example , political parties , which comprise at least 30 % of each gender on their electoral lists , receive a 30 % supplement from the government ’s budget . likewise , in ireland , political parties lose 50 % of their state funding if their candidate pool covers less than 30 % of either gender . beyond funding constraints , women face high social and cultural barriers to political participation . specifically , greater care responsibilities , strengthened through public perceptions of a “ “ woman ’s role ” – ” severely undermine women ’s ability to run for public office .
by all accounts , iran is a society deeply divided between those who want their country to be a respected member of the international community , and those for whom iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s international standing better serves through a nuclear-weapons program . the international sanctions imposed on iran would seem to be helpful in the latter , rather than the former . that might well be true if iran were to enter into a full-fledged democracy , genuinely accountable to the will of the people . but there is scant evidence to suggest that the sanctions did anything to slow iran ’s nuclear program . moreover , as is often the case , sanctions might have done more to decimate the middle class and further weaken the least powerful than motivate iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders to seek an agreement .
one hopes that the paris agreement is changing this , too . as with the information technology revolution , advances in clean-energy advances will require engaging both the public and the private sector . because we do not yet know which innovations will be the most important in decarbonizing the economy , investment must be allocated to a broad range of choices . long-term , patient finance also must be made available to help companies minimize insecurity and to bridge the so-called “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ death valley of death ” valley ” between basic research and commercialization . ” the bec ’s argument – that a “ new model ” will amount to public-private partnerships among governments , research institutes , and investors – – – – shines a welcome spotlight on the relationship .
but those challenges will not be addressed , and opportunities will not be realized unless children everywhere have the skills they need . for these reasons , my home country , senegal , has long been committed to giving its children – particularly girls and those from disadvantaged backgrounds – a quality education . in 2017 , we invested in 25 % of our domestic budget , – representing close to 7 % of gdp – in educating our children and young people . moreover , we are planning to provide up to 90 % of funding for a new program to improve senegal ’s quality education system from now to 2030 . even so , senegal struggles to meet all of the costs of reinvigorating its education system .
at the same time , the goal must be to boost european security integration ( in its broadest sense ) , lifting europe into the forefront of global security . as eu member states advance along this path , propelled forward through technological and operational excellence , and innovation , they will find avenues for eliminating unnecessary expenditures and an optimize of resource use . europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s defense industry will not make progress without a well-functioning market – an open , transparent one , and an equal opportunity for all of europe ’s suppliers . advances in the defense industry are leading to significant positive externalities , such as civil-military synergy and investment in research and development that are fundamental to growth , innovation , and future competitiveness . a critical component in the coordination and works properly for europe ’s security and defense policy is europe ’s defense agency .
for example , china banned shark-fin soup , a traditional delicacy , at official government dinners and functions – a move that contributed to a 30 % drop in shark-fin sales from last december to april . in the southern town of guangzhou , the center for china ’s ’s ’s ’s shark-fin trade , vendors reported a 82 % decline in sales over the past two years . it should not be hard to spur countries to take action to protect their shark populations , given that shark ’s economically value plummets when killed . a study by the australian marine institute has found that palau ’s ’s sharp-diving industry is worth far more than its shark-fishing industry . a single reef shark that frequents major dive sites in palau is worth roughly $ 179,000 annually , or $ 1.9 million above its lifetime ; the same shark would cost about $ 108 dead .
tudjman 's excuse was that croatia needed to concentrate power in dealing with serbian aggression . the truth is that he used the negotiated hostility with slobodan milosevic to solidify personal rule and russian-style plunder of state characteristics through his coterie of loyalists . to accomplish this with the maxim of the fuss it muzzled news and electronic media . despite hostility between serbia and croatia , dealing a dictator with milosevic was relatively simple . because both tudjman and milosevic believed in ethnically homogeneous states , they fomented forced population transfers ( ie , ethnic cleansing ) , and a partition of territory among themselves .
the now-proposed arrangements would authorize the chinese government to veto any nominee that it dislikes , spurring criticism that what is on offer is iranian-style elections : “ you can vote for anyone we choose . ” hong kong ’s government could call for changes to increase openness and fairness , by which its chief executive is chosen without abandoning his current path in favor of universal suffrage . under the rule of law , an electoral panel should be “ broadly high representative ” – a provision that the committee ’s current composition violates . its membership elecies just 7 % of hong kong ’s total electorate , and its voting procedures try to obstruct the nomination of any candidates who can harbor democratic sympathies . since 1997 , 55-61 % of voters voted for democratic candidates in legislative council elections .
in promoting democracy , liberals reject the argument used by today ’s rulers that a first-free election would last , because the islamists would win and establish theocratic regimes . reformers insist that an overwhelming majority of people support moderate solutions , or at least that radical islamist groups would need to become pragmatic in order to compete for power and govern . this case is not yet proven . january ’s palestinian elections were won by a relatively moderate leader , because it brought ahead by the ruling fatah movement and the islamists boycotted the elections . but in the gaza strip ’s local elections soon afterward , the radical islamists who use terrorism won seven out of ten municipal councils .
increasingly , the industry is implementing approaches that have ensured success in other sectors , such as lowering the cost of procurement and deploying lean principles in manufacturing . as clean-tech firms continue to scale themselves up , additional opportunities will be created to improve . a shakeout in clean-tech industries has been tough ; but it has also been typical of emerging-market technology and , by weeding out weaker players , make the sector more robust . this is a globally segment meeting a growing global need . there is little scope for doubt that a clean-tech industry can expect plenty of sunshine days ahead .
princeton – the economic gloom that enveloped the world in 2008 has led many to wonder whether the apparent prosperity that preceded it was genuine . we know that in countries as diverse as those of china , india , russia , and the united states , the number of billionaires soared . more broadly , the top 1 % of the us population prospered . but the gap between the rich and the poor widened and , at least in america , the incomes of the poor and the middle class stagnated.ampnbsp ; today , however , the gap between the rich and the poor has widened , and , at least in america , the incomes of the poor and the middle-class stagnated.ampnbsp ; no wonder that many are now skeptical of taxpayer-funded schemes to bail out banks , insurers , and even the automakers .
their primary goals are to allow companies and organizations to establish sustainability targets and core performance indices ; track , prepare , and disclose comparative data that measure their performance in economic and esg performance ; and to integrate sustainable production and consumption practices at company business strategies and models . globally , global awareness of this topic is mounting . more recently , mark carney , the governor of the bank of england and chair of the g20 ’s financial stability board , and michael bloomberg , a former new york city mayor and ceo bloomberg issued an early warning regarding market data . given the magnitude of the task , however , doing so is also vital to ensure effective coordination and harmonization of such efforts with competent standard-setters , regulators , and professional organizations . america ’s securities and exchange commission , for one , already discusses such issues , because it analyzes possibilities for responding to investor and business needs regarding esg .
in particular , smallholder landholders need new tools that enable them to boost productivity , while establishing more sustainable modes of production . this month , the g-20 summit and the united nations conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro provide pivotal opportunities to establishing a more holistic international approach to global economic recovery and sustainable development . pursuing thriving , inclusive economies must be combined with efforts to address climate change and achieve universal food security . but those outcomes that the world needs – viable financing options and frameworks to support economic transformation , as well as integrated ecological and sustainable-development governance – can not be realized without the political will . success at los cabos will depend on g-20 leaders ’ capacity to galvanize the same level of collective , concerted action that allowed them to curb the global recession in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis .
new york – global financial markets in 2008 were experiencing their worst crisis since the great depression of the 1930 ’s . major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought into cheap , or survived only after the major bailouts . global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed ; severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and many emerging-market economies staggered to the international monetary fund for help . so , what lies ahead in 2009 ? is the worst of times behind us or ahead ?
the good news is not news ; media executives often mutter . and it takes just a moment on twitter or cable news to reaffirm the old adage : “ “ “ “ “ if bleeds ” lead . ” add to that a second psychology bias neuroscientists debate : because our species have evolved to fend off dangers , we tend to be keener for bad news . we have react more acutely to images of starving children than to reporting on improving nutrition levels across africa . and , of course , we also tend to remember those horrible pictures much longer .
china ’s ’s ’s government apparently began to appreciate the constraints of cover-ups and stonewalling , and perhaps also the merits of allowing some room for free speech . this thirst for skill-biased information highlights the dramatic change brought about by the internet into china ’s political landscape . nowadays , the government no longer monopolizes information and does the right to process it . insightful bloggers attract significantly more clicks than do official mouthpieces . a “ “ virtual civil society ” is in making its case .
new york – countries often devote public money to encouraging their own goods and services ’ exports . but devoting resources to encourage imports – as china does with its inaugural international import expo , which just opened in shanghai is truly scarce . the annual import expo that will be part of china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s overall import promotion strategy has attracted thousands of companies globally with the promise of major orders from chinese firms , including state-owned enterprises that the government tasked with ensuring expo a success . if expo succeeds in boosting imports , one might expect it to reduce china ’s trade surplus . but that need not be the case .
london – the historian norman stone , who died in june , has always insisted that history students learn alien languages . language gives access to a people ’s culture and a culture in its own history . its history is telling us how it sees itself and others as well . the cell knowledge should therefore be an indispensable ingredient of the historian ’s engineering devices . it is the key to understanding the past and the future of international relations .
while that scenario is straightforward , reality is not . the first nagging question is this : will there really be elections next january ? prime minister ivanov allawi assures the world that there will be , and president bush is echoing his own words . more neutral observers – and , indeed , daily news bulletins about the bombings and being hostage taking and “ the insurgents ” – cast doubt on this prospect . the probability that the iraqis face this coming january needs to be less than 50 % , and one can be sure that these will be no free and fair elections throughout the country as a whole .
atlanta – as the united states marks the first anniversary of us president donald trump ’s election , the question of how trump ’s victory still commands attention , with russia ’s role increasingly moving into the center stage . every new revelation in investigating russia ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s meddling in the 2016 campaign brings the american democratic process ’s vulnerability to sharper attention . just last week , the us congress unveiled legislation mandating empowering facebook , google , and other social-media giants to reveal who purchases of online advertising , thereby closing the loophole that russia exploited during the election campaign . but making amends through technical fixes and public promise to be better corporate citizens will solve only its most publicized problem . a tougher challenge will be strengthened by the institutions charged with functioning democracy specifically , civics training , and local journalism .
yet , when the end is clear , politicians are often clueless . in america ’s presidential campaign , commercial protection is fashionable once more . but , while import restrictions may ease the pain of some manufacturing districts , they will not stop companies from relocating where growth opportunities are strongest . at the same time , they will not protect workers against the effects of technological change . and they will not recreate yesterday ’s patterns of development .
a move by military officers in tripoli against qaddafi and his sons could bring the conflict to an end , with military commanders gaining credit and the flow of political capital . four decades of military-based dictatorship , however , may be enough for libyans , a majority never really benefited from their countries ’ wealth or potential . when it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants – two critical issues for europe – arab military dictators have an inglorious track record . algeria in the 1990 ’s serves as a potent reminder of this , and western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees . getting stuck in a transition ” is a third possible scenario , with libya remaining in a “ gray zone ” – neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but “ semi-free ” – one .
but , of course , if they were part of a case against a muslim , that had to be handled in an islamic court . when muslims and non-muslims confronted each other in a trial , muslims enjoyed significant advantages . first , the judges ’ training predisposed them to give whatever inconvenience to a fellow muslim . second , the tribunal staff was thoroughly muslim , implying that testimony were viewed solely from a muslim perspective . a third , whereas muslims could attest to anyone , christians , and jews could attest only against another non-muslim .
some argue that the true point is the risk of attack and the devastation that might come if weapons of mass destruction are deployed . they employ something similar to cost/benefit analysis based on a subjective sense of dangers . but there is no way to produce an objective assessment of fear , and even if it could be achieved , using cost/benefit analysis to invade another country ’s territory would wreak havoc with the global system of national sovereignty and international law . a better way to make good sense of self-defense is to invoke two principles that underlie legal claims of justification in both domestic and international law . the first principle is reciprocity , which implies that if israel had the right to attack the osirak reactor , then iraqi people had the right to bomb an israeli nuclear facility at dimona .
most economies are becoming less equitable , with widening loopholes between the rich and the poor . and violent conflict remains widespread , with the world ’s poorest regions the most vulnerable to outbreaks . with these challenges in mind , world leaders agreed last year at the rio +20 summit to adopt sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) . the world ’s governments have asked the un secretary-general to coordinate preparing these goals by the year 2015 to ensure a degraded transition from the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) ( mdgs ) that expire that year . a crucial un general assembly meeting will take place at the end of september for this purpose .
today , staremploys roughly 182,000 people globally – 50,000 more than facebook , google , and apple combined . an argentine , jordanian , malaysian , or spaniard who can visualize and create prosperous global demand for a product or service – just as spain ’s amancio ortega did with zara – is just like much of an entrepreneur as the next bill gates is . from lahore to lagos , mexico city to mumbai , governments look at their own populations as pools of talent waiting to be tapped . it ’s high time for diplomats to do the same . they should encourage and encourage job creators and problem solvers , transforming development aid into investment .
though such politicians often describe themselves as “ rightist , ” their actual policies – such as that of former slovak prime minister vladimir meciar – are actually demagogic populist or authoritarian . likewise , the position of the political right in each central european country affects the experiences rooted in history and traditions . political developments in slovakia during the past 20 years of communism set the czech republic and slovakia apart from both poland and hungary . whereas both the polish and hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization that allowed relatively large semi-official zones of activity outside of communist control , czechoslovakia after the soviet-led invasion of 1968 became a rigid neo-stalinist regime . when communist regimes collapsed in 1989 , poland ’s communist party and hungary transformed themselves into a credible democratic-left parties that became formidable opponents of the newly emerging political right .
the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s maastricht treaty specifically reserves this tax-and-transfer authority to its member states , a reflection of europeans ’ unwillingness to transfer money to other countries ’ people in ways that americans are willing to do among people in different states . a third important difference is that all of america ’s states are obliged by requiring their constitutions to balance their annual operating budgets . whereas “ a rainy day ” funds that are accumulating during the boom years are used to deal with temporary revenue shortfalls , states at the bottom of the generalized commitment of borrowing are constraining capital projects like roads and schools . even a us state like california , which many as the poster child for fiscal profligacy , now has an annual budget deficit of just 1 % of its gdp and generalized debt of just 4 % of gdp . these limits on state-level budget deficits are a logical implication of why american states can not make money to fill their fiscal loopholes .
to my credit , i certainly do n’t feel safe just as an economics professor ! i do n’t seem to have doubted that sometime later this century one will be able to buy pocket professors – perhaps with holographic images – just as easily as one could buy a pocket kasparov today . so let ’s go back to india and china , too . globalization has passed fast through much of the past century , and at a particularly accelerating pace during its past two decades . still , a massive evidence body suggests that technological change has been a much greater driver in global wage patterns than does trade .
specialization in each country enables people to get more of what they want , which , particularly on higher income levels , comprises cleaner air and water . when trade costs down , it may benefit environmental goods just as much as it benefits other goods . so , does trade globalization , on balance , better or worse ? some empirical studies of cross-country data find net beneficial effects on environmental degradation indicators such as local sulfur-dioxide air pollution . provided that countries have effective national governance institutions , trade , and growth give them the means to clean their air .
tokyo – during the cold war , the term “ kremlinology ” laid out efforts to understand what took place at the commanding heights of the soviet union – indeed , behind the entire iron curtain . kremlinologists monitored ( in whatever form possible ) , who was up , and who was down amid the core of soviet tutelage . big relevance was read into who signed an official documentary , or who stood where atop lenin ’s tomb in red square when reviewing military parades . all of this was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decode the regime in north korea , where the truth is far more open . consider what has happened on december 17 .
in desperation , last-ditch effort , the imf is now inventing “ spill-over news ” news ” for a couple of systemically important economies , run out at the margins of its country ( article iv ) consultation . this initiative is destined to fail – as has the imf multilateral surveillance exercise , or the g-20 peer reviews in recent history . even if massive spillovers are unambiguously recognized , it is hard to see how this exercise will address the crucial problem behind a currency war : the major players ’ apparent unwillingness to reconcile vastly different national interests . so , what should latin american economies do ? they surely have a right to defend themselves , whether through foreign-exchange intervention and consequent accumulation of reserves ( a potentially profitable option as long as capital flows are actually temporary ) , imposing capital controls , or other currency-related macro-prudential policies targeting countercyclical exchange-rate smoothing .
had china let its currency float back then , it would have depreciated in value , deepening the crisis . countries were being warned : avoid trade deficits and buildup of reserves because it was a crucial frontlines of defense . east asian countries followed this advice and , for a good reason : they saw the consequences of shortages of reserves . east asian governments knew then that the imf ’s policies would deepen their downturns , but were powerless to resist . the imf had the money they needed to do .
welfare-to-work programs in michigan and wisconsin have served as the federal welfare reform model under president bill clinton , and obamacare rely on the massachusetts medical system , introduced under republican governor mitt romney . likewise , from 2000 to 2014 , by reinventing a wide variety of energy policies – from broad-based climate action plans to mandated renewable-energy standards – the 33 states slashed their emissions of carbon dioxide while expanding their economies . more recently , some us states introduced cap-and-trade schemes to place carbon prices , and many are already on track to meet obama ’s clean power plan targets . half of all america ’s states now legalized marijuana in some form , with eight embracing entirely legalization . three states implemented laws offering paid famines with fourth-.
cambridge – “ “ i want to be a part of it ” – new york , the new york times , ” frank sinatra of a city that attracted so many parts of the world , from artists and performers to businesspeople and bankers . in a sense , this is not a tricky phenomenon to explain ; metropolises like new york city , with its multicultural population , multinational corporations , and a multitude of talented individuals , are rife with opportunities . but the impact of large cities runs deeper than economic or even cultural power ; cities can fundamentally alter people ’s lives , and even those themselves . in 2010 , geoffrey west , together with the copenhagen consensus team , discovered that several socioeconomic measures – both positive and negative – increase with the size of the local population . in other words , greater the city , higher the average level of wage , productivity , levels of patents per person , crime rates , the prevalence of anxiety , and the incidence of hiv .
( it is likely that the eventual winner from ai will require ai to enter into a joint-manufacturing arrangement with india that american companies would not . ) as if all of this were not enough to decide against america , the clincher may well have been india ’s desire to evade any further transmissions controversy at a time when corruption allegations beset by all parties . a decision made on technicalities , many feel , would be easier to defer than one based on political considerations . against this are the unambiguous advantages of pleasing a significant new ally , and developing a pattern of bilateral military cooperation on the supply side , training , and operations that so far have developed . at a time when american nuclear-reactor purchases – made possible by an historic deal negotiated by the bush administration – had clung to america ’s insistence on exemptions on supplier responsibility in the event of an accident ; some regard india ’s spurning of america ’s aircraft as a gratuitous refusal to demonstrate that friendship with india helps america , too .
as a result , the large supranational institutions are lobbying hard for a pan-european approach to banking supervision and regulation ( and , implicitly , for fiscal bailouts should that supervision and regulation go bankrupt ) . when it comes to state-rescue banks , the rules of european competition are requiring divestment and downsizing . institutions like the royal bank of england , which for a time in 2009 headed the list for the world ’s largest international banks , are pruned by the eu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s competition directorate general . even stronger banks are being pressed to raise their capital reserves . in most cases , this means continuing to cut back on lending , aggravating the effects of the financial crisis onto the rest of the economy .
immediately , north korea did just that , threatening to carry out its “ enveloping ” strike at american territory by guam . trump has shot back that america ’s military is being “ locked and charged . ” and , indeed , as that exchange for a rhetorical conflagration has unfolded , the us was reportedly preparing revised revised military options to striking north korea . even more ominous , according to a confidential american intelligence report , north korea had accomplished the capability to miniaturize nuclear warheads and may have as many as 60 bombs . the stakes are rising in kim and trump ’s game of chicken .
two conclusions can be drawn from all this at once . the first is that we all owe , at least some of our success , to others , because of the public goods that society provides . this calls for more modesty and restraint in determining highest salaries , not for moral reasons , but for making the system more sustainable . a second conclusion is that the most privileged classes who benefited most from others ' solidarity , notably the poor , can no longer deny the latter ’s contributions . but do n't hold your breath waiting for them to agree .
when sweden ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s did , swedes said no . they understood that unemployment would skyrocket if the country ’s ’s monetary policies were set by a central bank that focused single-mindedly on inflation ( as well as an inadequate focus on financial stability ) . the us economy would suffer because the underlying economic model of europe predicated on the power relationships that disadvantaged workers . and , to be sure , what we are seeing now , 16 years after the eurozone institutionalized these relationships is the antithesis of democracy : many european leaders want to see the end of prime minister alexis tsipras ’s left-wing government . after all , it is exceedingly inconvenient to have in greece a government that is so opposed to the kinds of policies that have done so much to lift inequality in so many advanced countries and that has been so committed to curbing the unbridled power of wealth .
durham – earlier this year , islamist politics confronted massive setbacks in two of the country ’s major predominantly muslim countries : egypt and turkey . but it is too soon to write political islam off as a capable participant – even a leading force – in pluralist democracy . just one year after the muslim brotherhood , mohamed morsi , became egypt ’s first-ever freely elected president , millions of egyptians took to the streets triggering the military coup that ousted him . morsi ’s own brand of political incompetence and lack of vision in the face of an economic collapse would have been sufficient to lessen the support of his rule . but his rejection of pluralism and the pursuit of an islamic dictatorship , exemplified by his drive to centralized power in the hands of the brotherhood and place himself beyond egypt ’s examination of egypt ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s judiciary , proved undoing .
on may 19 , a group of korean researchers published in a journal science the findings of research showing that for the first time , isolated human-embryonic stem cell lines specifically tailored to match the dna of male and female patients of different ages . later , the next day , british researchers at newcastle university reported that they had successfully produced a cloned human embryo using donated eggs and a genetic material from stem cells . both breakthroughs represent a stunning advance in stem cell research . embryonic stem cells are " pluripotent , " meaning that they have the capacity to develop into any form of human tissue . this carries great promise , particularly for sufferers of spinal cord injuries and illness .
this includes ramping up the tradable-permit program by lowering the threshold beyond which firms must pay , as well as eliminating exemptions from permits for firms or industries . such actions would boost fiscal sustainability not only – – – – – – – – – – – – – – by improving the efficiency of overall resource allocation . finally , china can lower government expenditures ( in the medium term ) by streamlining its sprawling administrative hierarchy . in recent decades , many of the world ’s largest companies have engaged in new technology to reduce their networks of employees , from their top executives to factory workers , thereby reducing costs and boosting efficiency . by contrast , china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s government has retained the same six-layer of administrative structure – beginning with the central government and shifting down through provinces , prefectures , counties , township , and villages – since the founding of the people ’s republic 70 years ago .
indeed , the risks to a world free of nuclear weapons – or only a minimal number of them – are enormous . nuclear deterrence as a threat to kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people – a concept that does not fit with traditional morals . still , it has worked , preventing catastrophic wars , while making people more civilized and cautious . when one pole of nuclear deterrence weakened , owing to russia ’s political decline in the 1990 ’s , nato , the defensive union of democratic and peaceful states carried out aggression against yugoslavia . now that russia reneged on the capability , such a move would have been unthinkable .
just as the tragedy unfolded , so did researchers gain greater insight into the disease . prions seem to realize all of the conventional wisdom survivors all of the conventional wisdom , survivors of pressure-cook , irradiation , and even incineration at 340 ° c for four hours – an approach that is both routinely and reliably used to de-activate all known viruses and germany . moreover , prions lack their own genes , and they lack them . the prion gene is provided by an infected individual in whom it resides in the innocuous state . contagious prion then hijacks the body ’s ’s machinery , reprogramming it in a willing executioner of replication .
performing arts advocates in europe point to the u.s. , where , among other things , the music directors of even the great orchestras are now expected to play full part in fundraising operations and to be active in the local community on the orchestras . the same thing , they fear , will happen in europe . some conductors , not wanting to perform a tin cup as they wave their batons , reject important posts in america for this reason , feeling that they would interfere with their arts . daniel barenboim is rumored to have abandoned the chicago symphony orchestra in part because he has objected to the fundraising demands that have been made by him . but america ’s experience demonstrates that obtaining artistic leaders like orchestra musical directors to engage in fundraising need is no bad for the artistic side of work .
we should not forswear this option , but assert others , not least because the security council – whose backing would be politically , if not legally crucial – might never support an invasion . it would be odd to uphold the council ’s authority by means that it has failed to win its approval . more broadly , the council accepts the possibility of mounting air-defense program – going well beyond what was done in 1998 – on suspected wmd sites , presidential compounds , republican guard , and other armed-force targets . this would both hurt and weaken saddam , by establishing unmistakably the message that defiance of the un carries severe sanctions . at the same time , the council could declare that any fresh aggression or use , threatening or transiting wmd , would trigger saddam ’s removal and his persecution as an international criminal force for slobodan milosevic .
soon thereafter , us inspectors went back to tarmiya as well . this time , they recognized precisely what the enormous magnets were for : generating arms grade in the field of nuclear material . this time , dr. ahmed , the iraqi counterpart , realized that the game was up . some of the us inspectors that he knew well were writing on collegial terms during visits to vienna . that he would lie so brazenly was incomprehensible to his cronies on the inspection team .
but china ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s dizzying dizzying rise also dispelled three guiding myths about the impact of economic growth . the first is that growth reduces inequality and increases happiness . in 1955 , the economist simon kuznets hypothesized that income inequality would rise sharply , and then decline , in a pattern ininverted “ u ” or bell – as countries underwent economic development . given the pace of china ’s economic growth since 1978 , its experience refutes that claims more powerfully than any other event . china , after all , now appears to be one of the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most unequal countries .
thus , pakistan has gone one more step toward developing a rules-based political system . of course , its democracy has always been supposed to mean more than periodically holds out free and fair elections . it must also mean developing a robust rule of law , giving people enforceable property rights , and giving citizens the institutional means to settle disputes . pakistan held free and fair elections in 2002 and 2007 , preparing to hold another by the end of 2012 or early 2013 . had the supreme court not removed gilani , it would have been the first prime minister to finish his full term .
on the other hand , the cuban government continues to detain prisoners of conscience and criminalize demands for a society-wide dialogue . this year , the peoples of europe marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the iron curtain that once divided europe in two . that 20 years after this epochal event remains around cuba makes this anniversary poignant . to be sure , the tourists who crowd cuba ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s beaches remain oblivious to that of the iron curtain . but , no matter that ignorance and its economic interest , the eu should insist on releasing political prisoners and using all international institutions to place pressure on cuba ’s government to respect cuba ’s human and civil rights .
brigadier general kyaw hagadier , army high representative , recently told un special envoy ibrahim gambari that marchers in the streets stoked bogus monks . but we are genuine in the us , with the help of thousands from rangoon , mandalay , mandalay , pegu , arakan , magwe , magwe , and sagaing – all of whom have demonstrated for peace . some have said that the uprising in burma is over . that is what the junta wants the world to think . but we believe that the protests represent the beginning of the end of military rule in our country .
but plato would most likely marvel at the world ’s ’s ’s moral progress . after all , he believed that by being a “ philosopher ” meant assuming the responsibilities of a moral reformer . yet , although morality was always at the center of his thinking , many of the moral truths that we now take for granted never came to pass . for example , although plato opposed greeks ’ enslavement , he – like every other ancient greek – condoned the debar of “ barbarians ” ( non-greeks ) . nowadays , by contrast , even the emphatically non-philosophical person – say , plato ’s “ media escorting ” – could easily explain why slavery is wrong : “ a person is a person . ”
but it is at least as important to deal with local-level social divisions that have emerged as a source of conflict , particularly in violence hubs . here , local and international civil-society organizations , together with regional and municipal governments , have an important role to play , and colombia ’s past experiences overcoming similar challenges should attest to help . such efforts must foster progress on another front : rural development , which is the only economic issue that is being addressed in a peace deal . this is hardly surprising : after all , the massive inequities that characterizes rural colombia gave up the farc in its first place , and the conflict was centered in such fields . ( dismantling the narco-trafficking activities in which the farc was participating may also consider an economic issue , given the need to provide alternative opportunities in rural areas ; but it does , first and foremost , advance security . )
glattbrug , switzerland – rising youth unemployment , particularly in europe , is making headlines worldwide . according to the age of 25 , roughly 5.5 million europeans , on average , are unemployed . more than 7.5 million people aged 15-24 are “ neets ” – in terms of jobs , educational , or training . youth unemployment is above 25 % in 13 european countries , amounting to roughly 30 % in italy , ireland , finland , portugal , latvia , hungary , and slovakia , and surpassing 55 % in greece and spain . moreover , more than 30 % of job-seekers under age 25 have been unemployed for more than 12 months , and their job prospects remain low .
foreign producers are accused of “ unfair ” competition far more easily than domestic manufacturers . indeed , if standards for domestic trade laws were applied internationally , perhaps a supermajority for intra-american firms would be guilty of dumping . yet america ’s supreme court has set standards so high for american firms to be found guilty of predation that few cases are successfully prosecuted domestically . nor are trade negotiators debating eliminating this double standard . so developing countries worry that efforts to introduce `` competitive '' laws within trade negotiations will only make life even harder .
for emerging economies , this would merely be cure for dollarization of dollarization only in order to catch an even worse case for libraization . should this happen , then libra will diversify these countries ’ monetary and exchange-rate policies , helping to trigger a period of slow growth and financial instability . facebook is betting that libra will trigger a taurus market . but libra ’s benefits seem as slippery as pisces . the libra project is dangerous to the us and will require government regulation to keep it in check .
there is little reason to believe that inclusiveness affects the sustainability of growth patterns only in developing countries , though specific dynamics depend on a variety of factors . rising inequality , for example , is less likely to be politically and socially distortionary in high-growth environments ( think a 5-7 % annual rate ) than in low – or no-growth environments where the incomes and opportunities subset are either stagnant or falling . the latter dynamic is playing out today in france , with the “ yellow vest ” protests of last month . the immediate cause of the protests was a new fuel tax . the costs were not all that large ( around $ 0.30 per gallon ) , but fuel prices in france were already among the highest in europe ( about $ 7 per gallon , including existing taxes ) .
to divide the people in order to conquer them is an immoral strategy that has endured throughout recorded history . from alexander the great into stalin 's vicious , variants of that strategy were used to hold nations in thrall to the will of the emperor . we now see this strategy at work once as president vladimir putin 's stealthily seeks to restore kremlin supremacy over lands that were treated like " losing ” when the ussr imploded in 1991 . in so overplaying his hand in ukraine 's recent elections yet putin has made clear to the world 's neo-imperialist designs . in the wake of the euphoric mass protests in kyiv , russia 's presidential administration has since said that it can work with whatever government chooses to do ukraine .
in each case , an active ingredient of the trump doctrine is burden-sharing . skinner interprets this narrowly , focusing on the need for america ’s ’s nato allies to increase their defense spending . what it fails to acknowledge is that america , too , is pushing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural saving shortfall . america consistently runs both its fiscal deficit , with total expenditures ( of which defense comprised 14.8 % in 2017 ) far exceeding its income – and its current-account deficit . if those twin deficits run at a trend of more than 3 % of gdp per kilowatt-hour , america ’s net debt for the rest of the world – currently at more than 40 % of gdp – will double in less than 24 years .
consider , for example , how recent innovations jeopardize the export-oriented industrialization strategy that fueled many countries ’ development in recent decades . by taking advantage of plentiful and low-cost labor , developing countries managed to increase their share of global manufacturing activity , create jobs , attract investment , and , in some cases , kick-start a broader process of industrialization . but , for firms that seized the opportunity to cut costs by shifting production to the developing world , there was always a trade-off : offshore manufacturing meant a limited capacity to respond swiftly to shifts in consumer demand . now , technologies may offer another alternative , too . by investing in “ additive ” manufacturing , ” ” ” ” robots , and other non-human tools , companies could shift their production sites closer to their final markets .
even wives of men watching the game back home have had other issues to deal with . for instance , joyce , a former workmate , has a husband who is diehard manchester ’s united fan . every season , he breaks at least one piece of furniture , when his team loses . couches are being stained with beer , and kicked as they cheers from his favorite teams . she has changed her furniture for at least two years since married .
in fact , has any monster not yet contemplated as a potential conveyor of a revolutionary idea ? the idea that the murderous monster might symbolize a protester or an outcast , and therefore deserve compassion originated from french philosophers gilles deraze and pierre-félix guattari . challenging rené girard ’s explanation of the origins of irrational violence and hate from the other – ethnic or religious minorities that demonize and victimized – the depredations and guattari extended the concept of otherness into vampire . that set the stage for a paradigmatic shift in the understanding of homicidal monsters as never another . increasingly , such protagonists became the focus of academic attention , cultural criticism , and popular culture itself .
copenhagen – debates about global warming are marked by an increasing desire to stamp out “ low levels of thinking , ” a point of questioning the value of democratic debate . but closing off discussion simply implies the disappearance of reason from public policies . in march , al gore ’s ’s science advisor and a prominent climate researcher , jim hansen famously observed that when addressing global warming , the “ “ democratic process does n’t work . ” although science has demonstrated that co2 from fossil-fuel plants is heating up around the planet , policymakers are reluctant to follow through on their advice and stop building coal-fired electricity plants . hansen argues that “ “ the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process . ”
according to the inter-parliamentary union ( ipu ) , that election pushed south korea from 101st to 62nd place globally in terms of the rate of female mps , well ahead of 121st-ranked japan . rising women ’s mps led not only to increases in female cabinet members , but also to a wide range of policies and institutional improvements directed toward women specifically . and , though south korea slipped to 80th place in the ipu ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s most recent rankings , the fall reflects the share of female legislators in other countries . a key reason for the rise of female mps was the establishment of a quota system , under which south korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s political parties should ensure that 30 % of its female candidates are female . the campaign-finance law was revised to give additional government funding to parties meeting the quota , reducing the amount for parties that do not .
for bingham , the law must be open and – insofar as it can be – intelligible , clear and predictable . everybody should be governed by law , insulated from the personal latitude of those in power , and jurisprudence should settle without prohibitive costs or inordinate delay . finally , there should be equality before the law , combined with adequate protection of fundamental human rights . moreover , state authority should be reasonably exercised in good faith and for the purposes that it has conferred , with independent courts and judicial revision of laws ensuring that the government does not extend beyond its jurisdiction . courts and other formal adjudicative bodies should provide fair procedures .
it is the extreme right that has benefited most from centrists ’ failures . in finland , a heresy of the true finn party capitalized on the resentment of the eurozone ’s bailouts to finish a close third in april ’s general election . in the netherlands , geert wilders ’ freedom party wields ample power to game the kingmaker ; without its support , a minority , liberal government would collapse . in france , the national front , which finished second in the 2002 presidential election , was revitalized under marine le pen . nor is the opposition confined to eurozone members .
the eu pays lip service to turkey in euros , while seehofer pays orbán by tolerating policies that no german politician should . a fourth factor , of course , is germany ’s own commercial interests . german firms are making a great deal of money at the so-called visegrád four – the czech republic , hungary , poland , and slovakia – which together amount to germany ’s largest trade partner . but , herein lies the hungarian tail wagging a german dog . on its own , hungary is germany ’s 14th-largest trade partner for both exports and imports .
brussels – a new controversy has emerged between the european union and several of its major commercial partners as the eu decides to include in its emission-control scheme all of flights to and from its territory , including transcontinental ones . airlines will need to acquire emission permits for their flight of co2 . china and the united states are outraged . chinese airlines delayed orders to purchase european aircraft . the ceos of aircraft manufacturer airbus and major european vendors have urged european leaders to step in .
having looked closely at the risks to london as a financial center from outside europe , the us concluded that there was no compelling case for being able to damage the us . but we were never in doubt that being out of europe entirely was an entirely different matter . yes , special arrangements could be negotiated , but each needs to be negotiated individually . and , for the record , norway is an important net contributor to the eu budget – the price of its negotiations , despite not being a member . i doubt that other european countries would allow britain to operate like some offshore center at europe ’s periphery , free from european responsibilities but participation fully in its opportunities .
it also highlighted the rapid pace of epidemiological transition in middle-income countries , as well as the endurance of communicable disease , maternal , newborn , and nutritional deficiencies in sub-saharan africa . but the gbd could do more to inform policy debates and spur action to improve health , if provided with more detailed data breakdowns . policymakers remain accountable , first and foremost to their constituents whose unique needs they must meet . estimates of local disease burdens will be essential to combat afflictions like ebola ; controlling the rising toll of non-communicable diseases among middle-income countries ; and meeting sustainable development goals concerning maternal and infant health in sub-saharan africa . to help decision-makers make better use of their data , the institute for health metrics , and assessment that i head generates geospatial maps with groundbreaking solutions .
according to a study by goldman sachs , countries like greece , portugal , and spain would need to become 20-30 % cheaper , and germany ’s prices would have to rise by about 20 % relative to the eurozone average . to be sure , if germany were to abandon the common currency , the road back toward competitiveness would be easier for southern countries , as a rump euro would undergo devaluation ; but the crisis countries ’ fundamental problem would remain so long as their other competitive countries remain . spain , for example , would still have to cut its prices by 22-24 % relative to the new eurozone average . from this perspective , crises countries would not have been spared painful retrenchment as long as it remained in a monetary union comprising competitive countries . the only way to avoid this would be for them to exit the euro and devalue their new currencies .
one way to strengthen india ’s disaster-response capabilities would be to develop the marine equivalent of our territorial red army , to be able to train fisherfolk in ways that are engaged in search-and-rescue operations . such training , together with students ’ affinity for their fellow fishers and their surreptitious expertise , would make it for an extremely effective reserve force , to be deployed when disaster strikes . another issue that the focus on urgently needed and immediate financial relief relates to coastal communities ’ ’ long-term economic needs . to be sure , immediate relief is vitally important : ockhi has completely shut down daily activities in some coastal areas , causing severe economic ( not to mention emotional ) hardship for the region ’s impoverished fisheries communities . but perhaps the time has come to consider whether it is fair to condemn these communities to long-term dependence on fisheries .
ramallah – the united states should stop pressing to restart the palestinian-israeli peace process . doing so might be the best way to achieve the peace agreement – a paradox that reflects the enormous gap between the peace process and achieve genuine peace . make no mistake : this is not an invitation to arms or an appeal for a violent uprising . peace between the conflicting parties east of the mediterranean and the west of the jordan river can and must be achieved through negotiation . but if one party cares more about a process than the need for peace , something must go wrong .
the two world wars and the cold war shaped european integration as a peace project , the defender of the west ’s fundamental values , and shared economic prosperity . but the collapse of communism in 1989 , and the chance to transcend the continent ’s historic divisions , now called for a redefinition of the european project . the treaties of maastricht ( 1992 ) and amsterdam ( 1997 ) created a new organizational structure for the eu and laid the groundwork for political institutions as equals european economic power . the treaty of nice ( 2000 ) resulted from a rather poor compromise . statements by german chancellor angela merkel , whose country assumed the european union ’s rotating six-month presidency in early this year , are unambiguous : a period of reflection , approved by the european commission in 2005 , ended .
whenever i arrive in moscow , i am struck by its new shops and buildings . but another key aspect of the yeltsin era – its rollicking debates – has fallen silent . part of the explanation for this has increased official control , part of the declining public interest , and part of it is that russia ’s troubles nowadays seem less urgent . having seized influence through independent cable tv networks , ntv , and tv6 , russia ’s media have become vastly duller . the most recent fad is for officials to prosecute libel newspapers demanding more than $ 1 million .
true , the united states is not denmark , either . but it is not wrong to ask what makes the scandinavian welfare economies so successful and what americans could learn from them . the short answer is that the scandinavian countries give their peoples a job paying a decent enough wage to sustain a healthy , happy life . one need not be an economist to understand that a country ’s ’s ’s wealth depends , to a large extent , on the proportion of the population doing productive work in higher-value jobs . according to the oecd country by employment , the top seven countries worldwide have welfare economies .
berkeley – on my desk right now is reporter timothy noah ’s new book the great divergence : america ’s growing inequality crisis , and what we could do about it and milton , and rose managing director friedman ’s classic open open freedom to make a choice : personal statements . considering them collectively , my overwhelmingly felt thought goes from the fact that friedmans would find their task for justifying and advocating small-government libertarianism far more difficult today than they did in 1979 . back then , friedmans made three powerful factual claims on how the world works – claims that seemed true or at least arguably true at the time , but now seem quite plainly wrong . their case for small-government libertarianism rested largely on those claims , and has now mostly crumbled , for the world has shown itself to be disagreed with them on the way that it worked . the first claim was that macroeconomic distress results from a government , rather than an unstable private market , or , rather , that the form of macroeconomic regulation demanded to generate economic stability is straightforward and easy
the g20 should now follow through on this commitment and establish a clear timetable for ending fossil-fuel subsidies , including full transparency regarding such expenditures from the year 2017 onward and a ban on exploration and production subsidies by 2018 . second , the g20 must commit to combating tax avoidance , and to unraveling the murky system of tax havens and shell companies ( brought to light earlier this year by the panama papers ) used to pump money out of africa . according to the african union ’s high-level panel on illicit flows , chaired by former south african president thabo mbeki , africa is losing more than $ 50 billion each year from illicit financial outflows . g20 members should tighten their demands for tax disclosure , prevent shell companies from creating , intensifying efforts to combat money laundering , and establishing corporate-ownership facilities . the g20 and the oecd have already outlined measures to counter tax-avoidance methods , such as base erosion and profit shifting .
three of ukraine ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear units currently operate beyond their design lifetime , with nine others set to reach the end of their intended lifetime within the next five years . most immediately , the unit two in south ukraine will have reached this point in less than three weeks , which means that the snriu must now decide whether to grant it a 20-year lifetime extension . the snriu will make this critical decision without the key information on the health and ecological risks that the reactor presents both ukraine and its arab neighbors . although this contravenes ukraine as a signatory of the espoo convention to conduct cross-border environmental-impact assessments ( not to mention an opportunity to consider potential alternatives to continued the reactor ’s operations ) , no such analysis is expected to take place . last month , campaign groups in neighboring sweden wrote to their representatives at the ebrd request that the bank suspend its support for revitalizing ukraine ’s nuclear plants until a cross-border assessment is taking place .
curitiba , brazil , introduced a new urban food-production model . and oslo created a climate budget to guide financial decision-makers . at the business level , more than 700 firms with total market capitalization of more than $ 16 trillion have made far-reaching climate commitments , as the us implies a commercial coalition . and 289 investors , holding nearly $ 30 trillion in assets , have signed on to the climate agreement , a five-year initiative to engage the world ’s largest corporate greenhouse-gas emitters to improve governance on climate change , curb emissions , and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures . as a result , worldwide green bond issuance could reach $ 300 billion this year .
but this was not a recipe for restoring stability and growth . to succeed in restoring a robust growth path , east asia must deliver justice beyond individual human-rights abuses . as asian values proponents argued , all human rights – civil and political , just as social and economic – must step up . if not , advocates of democracy and human rights face a backlash . already , some indonesians are nostalgic for suharto ’s new order .
the virtuous chinese , on the other hand , rescuing a huge share of their incomes , castigated western economists for their failure to understand that their obligation to humanity was spending . a crucial theoretical point in the shift to a debt-fueled economy was redefinition of uncertainty as risk . this , in turn , was the primary achievement of mathematical economics . whereas guarding against uncertainty had traditionally been a moral matter , hedging against risk was a purely technical question . the main uncertainties in life – the destination of one nation ’s immortal soul – nudges one toward morals .
having excluded a grand coalition with either the anti-establishment populist five star movement or former prime minister silvio berlusconi ’s ’s center-right party , bersani will depend on senators ’ willingness to endorse concrete action . but there is a faltering and unbalanced approach to this approach . as a result , italy – and the european union – are headed toward the kind of political and financial turmoil that followed greece ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s general election last may , when a similar failure to produce a parliamentary majority forced yet another general election the following month . the cyprus crisis , which threatens to cause the country ’s banking system to collapse and force cyprus off of europe , could make the situation all the more difficult to manage . italy and greece have much in common , beginning with institutional malaise .
in the 1980s , for example , america entered into such agreements with a foreign car , microchip , steel , lakumber , and machine-tool producers . some terms imposed then have since been banned by the world trade organization . but , just a few years ago , america ’s auto industry pushed for a requirement in a trade deal that would give it a minimal market share of america ’s exports to south korea . trump is likely to dust off such tools , developing them further . if trump wants to bar manufacturing from moving overseas and encourage investment from abroad , we might soon see us companies pressured to agree voluntarily ” to outsourcing restrictions and localization requirements .
and america ’s per capita emissions are greater than they are in any other large country . the paris accord does not victimize america ; on the contrary , the american state has a world-beating responsibility to get its house in order . in fact , according to the world resources institute ’s data , america accounted for an astounding 26.6 % of global greenhouse-gas emissions from 1850 to 2013 . america ’s ’s ’s population today , at just 4.4 % of the world ’s ’s population , is barely half that of the united states . in short , it is america , where per capita emissions have always been several times that of the global average , that owes the world ’s climate justice , not the other way around .
and that volatility is the other reason why a casino metaphor applies : china ’s stock market can rise or fall by twice digits , without triggering a broader economic crash – at least so far . for example , china ’s gdp growth was unaffected ( indeed , its economy grew at nearly 10 % ) , when the us stock market lost half its value from 2001 to 2005 , or that matter , when the us then recovered ( only to fall dramatically again after the 2008 financial crisis ) . since then , china ’s stock market has been a global laggard – that is , until the last year , when it became the world ’s best performing , rising by more than 150 % . and yet the roller-coaster pattern continues : the 8.5 % plunge came when the market resumed on the monday that followed in 2008 ’s largest two-day rise . that rise was preceded by a loss of almost a third of the market ’s value from mid-june to early july .
london – once again , talk has turned to macron . i have sought to explain that his trademark phrase , en même temps ( simultaneously ) , which tends to be heard as an expression of american-style pragmatism , may instead form one of the most visible traces of his doctrinal proximity to the french protestant philosopher paul ricœur . far from reflecting on an unambiguous choice , “ at the same time is the credo of someone suspended in fear and oscillates before an unsolvable , terrifying mystery of the twin nature – both physical and spiritual – mortal and resurrected – of christ ’s tormented body . very soon , however , we are arriving at the question of anti-semitism in america . on the one hand , one can be traced back to the horde of nativists , white supremacists , and the neo-confederates that descended on charlottesville , virginia in august to break some black and jewish head .
santiago – now that populists are coming to power in the west , a conflict over intellectual ownership of its approach is brewing . writers like john judis argue that nineteenth-century americans invented political populism with their anti-elitist attitude and inflammatory rhetoric . the argentines that gave the world über-populist juan domingo perón , or the brazilians who brings us getúlio vargas might plead to different charges . yet there can be no disagreement that latin americans were the longest and best practitioners of economic populism . during the twentieth century , perón and vargas , plus alan garcía in perú ( at least during his first term ) , daniel ortega in nicaragua and salvador allende in chile , and much else engaged in trade protectionism , ran large budget deficits , overspent their economies , allowed inflation to skyrocket and eventually suffer currency crises .
what is remarkable about this is that it has lasted for so long . but it was a recent statement by us secretary of defense robert gates , who has been particularly shocking toward israelis . he has expressed understanding for iran ’s ’s desire to acquire nuclear weapons , because , as he has put it , the iranians are encircled by nuclear powers like pakistan , india , russia , and israel . israel is bound to fight against this emerging new american doctrine , which equates it with iran , or even with india and pakistan for that matter . political contexts matter , the israelis will argue .
abidjan – on december 2 , côte d’ivoire ’s ’s ’s ’s independent electoral commission ( cei ) declared opposition leader alassane ouattara the winner of the country ’s november presidential election with 54.1 % of the vote . the incumbent , laurent gbagbo , had gained 45.9 % . the united states , the european union , canada , and the united nations general assembly secretary-general all congratulated ouattara , calling on gbagbo to respect the people ’s will . one day after his term was announced , the country ’s ’s ’s constitutional council , headed by gbagbo ’s close ally paul n’dre , annulled results from seven departments in the north , declaring gbagbo the electoral winner with 51 % of the vote . that decision , reached in less than 24 hours , left many ivorians flabbergasted .
moreover , unlike last year , when the rush home for the lunar new year celebration hampered freak storms , millions of migrant laborers have already returned to their rural households this year . many will stay there , because the global economic downturn hit china hard , costing them their jobs . littered with the host of extremely sensitive anniversaries , 2009 might well prove even more dramatic and unforeseeable than in 2008 . fast approaching is not only the march anniversary of last year ’s disturbances in tibet , but also the 50th anniversary of tibetan unrest in 1959 , which led to the dalai lama ’s exile and his supporters . since the riots last spring , china ’s government has pursued many proactive measures , even adopting a “ “ serf liberation day ” to defend its record in tibet for the last 50 years , while continuing to talk with the dalai lama ’s representatives .
dealing with the deficit has required hard choices – from reforming the welfare system and increasing the government ’s pension age to controlling public-sector wages . but i have always believed that a country can not make itself richer by writing checks to itself . we need accountable choices to ensure that we can live within our means , and that is what i are determined to deliver . a government that lives within its means is a necessary condition for securing the economy over the long term , but that is inadequate . success also requires taking bold steps to tear down trade barriers and to open up the economy to investment from fast-growing countries like china and india .
indeed , the recent boom in some parts of the developing world shows precisely this . second , while putting pressure on the technology frontier is a critical element of industrial countries ’ growth , what matters for developing countries is reshaping production and export-oriented structures , particularly by shifting resources into higher-level activities . the key to achieving this lies in the capacity to diversify domestic manufacturing through generating new activities ; strengthening economic linkages within a country ; and creating new domestic technological capabilities . building industrial and modern service industries is critical to successful diversification . conversely , de-industrialization , and a concentration of growth in informal service activities are a proven recipe for failure , as has been demonstrated by the sad experiences of most developing countries in recent decades .
today , few know where the term “ globalization ” originated . the oxford english dictionary gives as the earliest allusions to its current usage an academic article in 1972 . the word was used earlier , but in a rather different sense . it was a diplomatic term conveying a linkage between disparate political premises ( for example , in negotiating simultaneously on financial and security matters ) . the old etymology ignores the naymology origins of the term , which can be found in the inventive linguistic terminology of continental europe ’s student radicalism .
without its determination , backed by a highly credible show of military force and skillful diplomacy , iraq ’s military programs today would not be vulnerable to scrutiny more intense than what has been applied to any other would-be proliferator anywhere in the world today . a credible threat of war has been essential to achieving this extraordinary feat . but precisely because it is so extraordinary , it is hard to see how carrying out these threats by initiating a war can make any sense at all . if , during inspections by iraqis , were exposed as having lied and cheated this way by affirming inspections ’ effectiveness , scarcely a justification for military reprisals . the best “ grave consequences ” under which the united nations security council warned should iraq fail to meet its obligations would be an even sharper effort to destroy its illicit weapons through steady inspections of the country ’s offensive military capabilities : inspectors , not invaders .
though their vision of “ information security ” could legitimize authoritarian governments ’ ’ ’ use of censorship and therefore unacceptable to democratic governments , identifying and target behaviors that are illegal everywhere . limiting all intrusions would be impossible , but one could start with cyber offense and cyber terrorism . major states would have an interest in minimizing damage by agreeing to collaborate on forensics and controls . the historical analogies , of course , are imprecisely because of course imperfectly . obviously , cyber technology has a very different approach from nuclear technology , especially because non-governmental actors may exploit it far more readily .
most greek debt is owed within the state-owned system – for example , by state-owned enterprises ( soes ) to state-owned banks , and the government could simply write off bad debts and recapitalize the banks , funding operations with either borrowed or printed money . alternatively , the banks could perpetually roll over existing debt , forever extending new loans to service their old debts . that , of course , would produce a wasted investment . indeed , with banks failing to impose tough budget constraints on financially unsustainable firms , and with a plan incapable of imposing alternative efficient discipline , china is already awash with apartment blocks in third tier cities that will never be occupied and with massive overcapacity in heavy industries . but , as some chinese policymakers react , all growth processes involve waste : nineteenth-century railway booms in britain and america have created massive overcapacity and investor losses , even as they have spurred economic transformation .
moreover , namibia ’s ’s ’s government wisely understands that its abundant natural resources can easily become a curse , enriching a few at the expense of the many . the authorities know that unless namibia ’s natural wealth invests in infrastructure , and its people ’s productive capacity , resource depletion will leave the country poorer , not wealthier . they also know that it would be irresponsible not to garner namibians the most that they can from the country ’s ’s ’s resources , and to be rethinking investment laws and revisiting the mining contracts to ensure that they do so . transparency is critical to this process , so that the government ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s strong commitment to press freedom is so vital . as president hage geingob put it , the press often reports things it does n’t like .
it is not unimaginable that this type of collaboration could extend to include other neighbors around the levant . the good news is that cyprus ’s newly elected president , nicos anastasiades , may be open to such an agenda . naturally , much will depend on how it fares politically in the current turmoil surrounding a bailout package . anastasiades , a member of the pro-european dimokratikós sinayermós ( the democratic rally ) party , won 57 % of the popular vote on a platform that emphasizes economic recovery , and that will naturally make him his top priority . nevertheless , an cautious look beyond today ’s current turbulence – and to anastasiades ’s history – provides grounds for optimism .
yet the head of the commission is being called upon to be europe 's dynamic public facing . the commission , ’s own internal cautiousness and red tape , is a constraint that nobody in brussels much likes to speak out . it is no structure conducive to political coups de theâtre , and much of the commission ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s work is the inexorable grind of eu regulation and re-regulation . but the bottom line is that , at a time when everyone is asked , “ “ what is europe doing ? ” the commission 's responses seem inadequate . for reasons that are obscuring nowadays , there is the unwritten rule that commission presidents must draw from ranks of past or current prime ministers .
but it is not at all obvious that the uk provides such certainty , especially now that it is on a path to leaving the eu ’s single market and customs union . independence would enable scotland to develop policies more in line with other successful small economies – not least by retaining eu membership . as scotland confronts brexit ’s strategic challenges , it would also have an opportunity to devise policies that are better suited to it . britain chose to leave the eu because it had an outsized view of itself . but it will soon have to follow the small-country model , like that of switzerland or norway .
second , with china such an influential driver of global demand ( both directly and indirectly through important network effects ) , the outlook for the world ’s largest second-largest economy has disproportionately implications for the projections of global corporate revenues . and , with china ’s excessive domestic credit expansion and the shadow-banking system gaining a lot of attention , many companies are becoming anxious . third , while companies recognize that innovation has a key comparative advantage in today ’s global economy , so , too , are humbled by its increasingly winner-take-all nature . in fact , successful innovation today has much less to do with funding , and a lot more to find a “ killer app . ” as a result , many firms , far less convinced that a typical normal ” in innovation yields large payoffs , end up investing less overall than they did before .
stockholm – it has now been one year since the failed coup in turkey , and questions about the country ’s future still abound . last year ’s ’s ’s attempted coup d’état have been nothing , if not dramatic . mutinous f-16 fighter jets bombed the turkish parliament , with 249 people losing their livelihoods . but the putschists have failed to detain president recep tayyip erdoğan , who has then mobilized his own supporters and sealed the coup ’s destiny . had a coup not been stymied in the first 48 hours , turkey probably would have plunged into a devastating and violent civil war , the consequences of which extend well beyond its borders .
seoul – once again , tensions are rising across asia over north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s missile program . in contrast to its previous “ surprise ” missile commence , north korea ’s government this time notified international agencies of its intention to launch a “ satellite ” sometime between april 4 and march 8 . the question for the world now is not whether the north korean regime will launch its own missile , but what will happen in the afterward . the united states , japan , and south korea have already publicly condemned the launch as a “ provocative act ” and a violation of united nations security council resolution 1718 , adopted in october 2006 , just five days after north korea conducted its nuclear-weapons test . but , rather than spurring hot rhetoric , what is needed now is a cool-headed assessment of the military consequences of a us missile launch .
and it has just held up the first round of the eu presidential election , which is meeting europe ’s high standards of freedom and fairness . the eu , for its part , deserves some credit for this outcome . it has been ten years since the eu initiated its eastern partnership , which established a more reliable framework for the bloc to work with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova , and ukraine . this initiative is worth recalling , was in part a reaction to the russia-georgia invasion the 1990s , when the kremlin tried to dismember poland by recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . in the event , neither russia nor any of russia ’s closest allies would agree to recognize those occupied territories or legitimize its invasion .
a child ’s policy of action is no longer sufficient . without a renewed vision for europe and an effective approach to crisis management , the continent ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s new ( and old ) nationalists will continue to gain momentum and endanger the entire project of peaceful integration based on the rule of law . the brexit referendum will highlight the very path , both for the uk and for the eu as a whole . it will follow either from the sighs of relief ( as i hope ) , or the cataclysm that rocks the eu to its core and brings catastrophe to the uk . but , however determined the bri may determine europe ’s numerous crises .
chicago – now that the dust has settled over the selection of the international monetary fund ’s managing director , the imf can get back to its fundamentals in managing crisis management . christine lagarde , a competent and well-regarded technocrat , will have her hands full of three significant challenges . the first , and probably simplest , challenge is to reestablish the imf ’s ’s ’s public image . while the criminal case against dominique strauss-kahn on sexual-assault charges now looks highly uncertain , the ensuing press focus on the imf suggests an unchecked international bureaucracy with unlimited expense accounts dominated by men with little sense of restraint . fortunately , however , the truth is more prosaic .
an increase in the monetary base , however , is only temporary ; when bond yields are redeemed , they reverts to their initial level . this eventual need to shrink the monetary base is an implicit claim on the central bank ’s assets ; hence , an increase is rightly seen as a liability for its balance sheet . under a fiscal stimulus financed by helicopter money , however , the central bank never needs to reverse the rise of the monetary base . because holders of distributed money do not claim to the central bank , the rise of the monetary base should be viewed not as an act of accountability , but as an increase in the central bank ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s net net worth . in other words , helicopter money is not interest-free credit ; it is a gift .
her party charged serra ’s orchestrating the attack , and , in revenge , her party – the liberal front – threw its support to ciro gomes . with sarney out , lula reigned supreme in the polls , reaching 43 % in mid-may . then , in early july , gomes skyrocketed to just 28 % , within striking distance from lula , who had refused to account for 33 % . gomes used television hours to be available to his three-party labor alliance in late june to huge influence , but most of the credit his ascent to the superb performance of his second wife , the popular actress patricia pillar , who had been recovering from breast cancer . brazil ’s severe summer market jitters , during which the country ’s wage index abruptly topped nigeria ’s and short-term credits for international trade dried up , began to change the face of the election .
claremont , california – though rapidly de-escalation of violence in hong kong appears terrifying enough , matters may well be about to get much worse . the communiqué of the recently concluded fourth plenum of the 19th central committee of the chinese communist party ( cpc ) indicates that chinese president xi jinping intends to tighten his grip on a former british colony at all costs . he should brace himself to block a formidable bill . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
these deficiencies partly reflect lasting governance weaknesses , despite important political reforms , notably the 2011 constitutional shift powers from monarch to parliament , and legal reform , such as aligning legislation with european and international human-rights norms , as well as advancing family rights and gender equality . moreover , regional tensions – including the escalating political instability in algeria , and the thorny issue of western sahara – have hampered integration in the maghreb , an absolute imperative to unlocking prosperity in north africa . and yet , despite the challenges it faces , morocco has displayed strong leadership on some of today ’s most pressing issues . it has been a vocal champion of anti-extremism initiatives , including responsible religious education , far beyond its own borders . it has become a global green-energy leader , committed in 2015 to increasing its share of renewables to just 52 % by 2030 – one of the world ’s most ambitious targets .
to use eurobonds as a large-scale sovereign-debt mechanism jeopardizes the longer-term goal of eliminating moral hazard : it offers an absolution precisely for about 60 % – a of-gdp margin in which countries would face the most hardship in resisting temptation . after all , there is little reason to believe that the fiscal compact or proposed “ debt brakes ” will succeed where the maastricht criteria and the sgp have failed . rules need a credible enforcement mechanism . misplaced hope that the enforcement problem can be solved by enshrining the fiscal compact in member states ’ constitutions might be based on a misunderstanding of the american system . to be sure , america ’s federal government never bailed out a state , 49 of which ( all but vermont ) had laws or constitutional provisions that limit deficit spending .
but , because the treaty on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights ( trips ) came into effect in 1995 , every member country of the world trade organization had to recognize one another another another ’s pharmaceutical patents . for india ’s drug companies , producing generic versions of patented drugs would require certifications , and such licenses rarely , if ever , be made public . nonetheless , following amendments to indian patents act , india still had some safeguards to avoid the kinds of excesses that major drug companies routinely get off in america and europe . india , for example , abides by a tighter definition of what represents an invention that prevents “ evergreening ” : the process of extending a us patent ’s life by taking secondary patents for marginal improvements to the old drug ’s . according to section 3 ( d ) of india ’s patents act , “ simple discoveries of a new form … or … using the known substance or using the known process is not eligible for a patent unless it results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant .
likewise , foreign actors who criticize brazil ’s exploitation of its rainforest – from european governments to pope francis – advocate biodiversity only in order to exploit it in the future . with characteristic misogyny , he recently declared that “ brazil is like the virgin it wants ” by any foreign pervert . but bolsonaro does not want to hold the amazon chaste ; he merely wants to be among those exploiting it . his promotion of the rainforests ’s development and attacks on environmental regulation has led , for example , to the prevalence of farc , particularly cattle raning , and illegal logging . according to brazil ’s ’s national space institute for research , brazil ’s deforestation increased in june 88 % year on year .
kim appears perfectly willing to subject the north korean people to privations of every sort in order to stay in power . of course , there are notable differences between north korea and iran . most obvious , iran ’s nuclear program has not taken off , whereas north korea – which , unlike iran , having withdrawn from the non-proliferation treaty – already has an estimated 60 nuclear warheads and appears to be making progress toward a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us mainland . in short , an all-out military conflict with north korea would have posed immediate global risks . trump may have already begun to recognize that mounting pressure on north korea does not exclude it to sitting down to negotiate with kim .
a third argument against putting anti-manipulation provisions in the tpp is that they would imperil america ’s ability to implement monetary stimulus . but this reflects a profound misunderstanding of the issue . a well-designed currency chapter in the tpp would not obstruct american monetary independence . conventional monetary policy operates by reasserting short-term interest rates that comprise the central bank ’s purchases and sale of short-term government debt . no foreign-exchange intervention – purchases and sell foreign-currency currency .
so it ’s entertaining to boast that one ’s own brand of knowledge , whether experimental physics , math , or cosmology , is pointless . but a joke would n’t work unless there were simultaneously another broadly shared assumption that science has a value independent of any practicality . after all , it would not have been entertained if a charities dedicated to famine relief celebrated its own ineffectiveness ; the practical value in which case it was paramount , for it being the only true reason for a charity to exist . so , while potential usefulness may be the reason why governments devote so much money to science r & d , people really expect more from science than it does . on this view , too , there is a rather different , higher purpose for science : understanding the natural world .
the us position did not help , either . last year , us president barack obama ’s administration asked congress for $ 1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the zika threat . but abortion politics intervened because republican legislators , leading congressional hearings on the zika outbreak , made funding conditional on recipient countries ’ anti-abortion policies . the problems with the dominant approach to contain the zika virus – namely , that it saddles women with too much responsibility while ceding too little power – are not lost on everyone . last year , the un refugee agency and the world health organization emphasized the need to place human rights at the heart of the zika outbreak response .
should they become consolidated democracies , as hoped , would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption . and the launch of european loans would make it much easier to look for a single ’s fortunes back home . such an approach needs to be communicated both to the european public and to those in tunisia , egypt , and other arab countries . it would reverse the pattern whereby europe relies on repressive regimes to deliver it with oil and gas , and it would guard its borders against migrants . at long last , these countries ’ demographic fortunes would harness their development needs .
to be sure , what is advantageous today may be problematic tomorrow : europe and japan confront significant challenges at a time when their demographic pyramids towards the elderly , eliminating the temporary demographic advantage that they have relative to america today . but this is not what ails their economies now . edmund phelps of columbia university argues that these slow-growing countries lack the “ dynamism , ” which he defines as a combination of a entrepreneurial spirit and a set of financial institutions to channel it . both spirit and the required financial institutions must be present to enable “ creative destruction ” – a force that joseph schumpeter famously argued that sixty years is an engine of capitalist prosperity – to unravel . but does that an accurate description of the slow-growing countries ?
in argentina , one bumbling president succeeds another . institutions are ripped apart , property rights are being challenged , and a randomized and ever more corrupt redistribution effort is under way . peru and venezuela hardly look better ; brazil may soon follow the same course . lula ’s popularity among ignacia da silva and his team , leading opinion polls in the run-up to brazil ’s presidential election , serves as a warning that much of the latin american public is poised to reject traditional governments . lula and his party are thus well off from the mainstream of economic thought and the policy that capital has already begun to pursue -- despite decades of elections .
by 2040 , in the iea ’s more optimistic scenario , solar power in sub-saharan africa will produce 14kwh per person annually , less than what is needed to keep one two-watt led permanently lit . likewise , the iea estimates that renewable power will still cost more , on average , than any other source – oil , gas , nuclear , coal , or hydro , even with a carbon tax . few in the rich world would switch to renewables without heavy subsidies , and certainly nobody cuts their links to the mostly fossil-fuel-powered grid , which provides a stable power along cloudy days and at night ( another level of subsidies ) . yet western activists seem convinced that world-worst-worst-off people should be content with inadequate and irregular electricity supplies . indeed , in its recent africa energy outlook , the iea estimates that africa ’s ’s per capita energy consumption will rise to 80 % by 2040 ; but , with the continent ’s population nearly doubling , less energy per person .
in 2011 and early 2012 , there was much talk of a crash in china ’s housing market and a chain-reaction to defaults in underground credit networks and local-government finance platforms . talk turned to the dangers of a resurgent housing bubble in 2013 and the collapse of the shadow-banking system , consisting mainly of wealth-management firms and trusted companies . based on market sources , total assets managed by the shadow-banking system has grown exponentially since 2009 , totaling ¥ 14 trillion , or one-third of gdp in the third quarter of 2012 . with relatively slow growth , corporate profitability – upon which the returns of the shadow-banking system ’s three main asset pools – is low and falling . where , then , will the high-return banking system ’s high returns ?
europe ’s industries are afflicted by similar problems . refining , petrochemicals supplies the eu with a large share of its fueled , and are also a major source of tax revenues . downstream industries , together with the distribution of fuels , are contributing an estimated € 240 billion annually to treasury coffers . by any reckoning , this is an important industry that should not suffer from overregulation . but , while industry faces the threat of bloated gas prices from around the world , its worries closer to home are the eu ’s abundance and national energy regulation .
the answer , it seems , is that its centrist chancellor , angela merkel , has pushed back against trump . yet draining the poison from europe will require a lot more than the scolding of the us , and praying for trump ’s ’s early departure . in fact , some eu leaders ’ approach to issues like immigration threatens to create a systemic problem that will endure long after trump has returned to the life of golf courses and the bankruptcy court . sensible european leaders may be forgiven for thinking politely along the way to push the uk on the path to focusing its attention on threats to its long-term cohesion and fundamental values . the eu has always prided itself on being a community of values that protects minorities and welcomed the poor and downtrodden .
acknowledging such thoroughgoing fallibility may seem paralyzing – and the current political mood certainly does seem to reflect this point . but recognizing fallibility may actually prove empowering , for it implies the possibility of improvement in both economics and politics . if the world becomes too intricate and unforeseeable for either markets or governments to achieve their social goals , then new systems of checks and balances must be designed in such a way that policy decision-makers constrain economic incentives and vice versa . if the world is characterized by ambiguity and unpredictability , then pre-crisis economic theories – rational expectations , efficiencies , and money neutrality – must reconfigure . moreover , policymakers must rethink much of the ideological super-structure erected on market fundamentalist assumptions .
similarly , it would have been hard but not impossible – to reduce incentives created by almost every country ’s ’ fiscal regimes for corporate leverage . at the same time , governments need to work to reduce existing debt – and deficient global demand to which it contributes . simply put , it is not feasible for highly leveraged governments to grow their way out of indebtedness . nor can austerity alone suffice , because it would require countries to make such large fiscal adjustments – 5 % of gdp , in spain ’s case – that citizens are likely to resist them , as the greeks have done . a more efficient approach would employ a broader set of tools , including debt restructuring .
and others do become more tangible , just as giving away personal data in exchange for access to a service . third , inequitable pay and incentivizing structures is bad for business . much has been written about the extraordinary bonuses paid to investment bankers during the height of the financial crisis . but silicon valley ’s ceos are no robin hoods . tech entrepreneurs might tell their investors that they want to transform the world , but many are intoxicated with the notion that the world would be better off by selling their business to the highest bidder .
for europeans , this is a necessary principle . moreover , it has never wavered in critical questions of legal and practical equality for women , or about asserting their dismay at the growing number of niqabs and hijabs now seen on the streets of which prevent people , comments by showing up in opposition to face . likewise , khan has made his point in favor of gay marriage a fatwa for apostasy since the fearsome head imam of the bradford mosque . one might say that no less could be expected from a labour leader with a bright future in churchill ’s country . but one must still follow , accepting that khan did not appear on these matters to facile communitarianism common on the other side of the channel .
in europe , regulatory changes like the second-payment services directive ( psd2 ) have been crucial in opening the banking system , and regulators like the united kingdom ’s current financial conduct authority have some time running regulatory sandboxes to smooth the way for new entrants by helping them to structure themselves with standards . psd2 , often described as “ “ open banking , ” often requires banks to offer their customer data to non-bank providers of payments and account for information services . aggregators can then introduce a customer with an integrated view of their finances and offer add-on services . perhaps the time to assess the financial-stability risks of open banking were during the consultation period before the directive passed . even now , the list of contributors to the fsb ’s work shows that neither the european commission nor core regulators in europe and north america were implicated .
some ideas turn out to be worse than wrong : catholics interpret the world as they interpret the world in ways emphasizing secondary issues – say , access to raw materials – and blinds societies to more promising opportunities that might lie elsewhere . consider finland , a nordic country endowed with many trees for its tiny population . a classical economist would argue that , in terms of this effect , the country should export the timber that finland has done . a traditional development economist , on the other hand , would argue that it should not export timber ; instead , it should add value by reasserting timber into paper or furniture – something that finland , too , does . but all wood-related goods represent barely 20 % of finland ’s exports .
we need to get to around 50 grams / kilowatt-hour by 2050 , rather than 500 grams / kilowatt-hour . we need to get to zero-emission vehicles , rather than more efficient gas-burning vehicles , especially given that the number of vehicles worldwide could easily double by mid-century . deep decarbonization also requires not natural gas and fuel-efficient vehicles , but zero-carbon electricity and electric vehicles charged with a zero-carbon electricity grid . this more profound transformation , unlike the low-hanging fruit eyed today of policymakers , offers the only path to climate security ( that is , stay below the 2ºc limit ) . by pursuing coal to gas or , more efficient gas-burning vehicles , we are at risk of being dragged into the high-carbon trap .
rather than become agents of change , they often impede change . ( indeed , the great economic debate in south korea nowadays concerns whether the chaebols are stifling innovation by preventing upstart rivals from challenging them . ) the productive transformation that developing countries need is far easier to achieve with support , rather than obstruction , of their conglomerates . but securing such support requires policies that nudge ( or even shove ) conglomerates toward the export industries that can grow beyond those of the domestic market – industries in which competition encourages discipline that they lack , owing to dominating local markets . to succeed , conglomerates require government support and corporate acceptance .
working groups might be created to try to develop a shared narrative . at the same time , negotiations would have to cover contemporary issues , including the tour d’horizon of current hotspots . what is iran doing in yemen , lebanon , iraq , and , in particular , syria ? how will it define its interests in these countries ? does it really see itself , as many sunni arabs assert , as the protector of shia arabs ?
domestically , china will be the first country that , owing to its sheer size and demanding gdp growth , is being compelled to pursue a “ green ” economy . otherwise , china would rapidly reach its “ limits to growth , ” with catastrophic ecological risks , and as a result of political repercussions . given that china would be the world ’s most important market in the future , it would be decisive in determining not just what the us produces and consume , but on how . consider the shift away from its traditional automobile to electric transportation . despite european illusions to the contrary , that will be decided in china , rather than in the west .
first , the ecb ’s ’s ’s renewed renewed bond purchases must make explicit plans for a reduction in sovereign interest rates to a sustainable level that is at least 200 basis points below their july averages . a high-level german diplomat reportedly dismissed spain as a 6.5-7 % interest rate recently , on the ground that spain borrowed at almost equal rates in the 1990 ’s . but that statement , bizarrely , ignored spain ’s ’s ’s ’s higher pre-euro inflation rate – thereby puzzling real and nominal rates – and more rapid gdp growth . for countries pursuing agreed reform programs , the ecb should commit itself to bringing down interest rates to levels compatible with projected inflation and growth rates , while announcing how long ( say , nine months ) this will continue . a sporadic program without such announced targets is unlikely to work , and could even prove counterproductive , because private investors might well demand even higher returns , because an increasing ecb share of debt would be regarded as senior , augmenting their risk .
but that rule succumbed rather quickly to violent money-demanding shocks , even as friedman ’s common-argument – that a credible commitment to low inflation requires favoring rules over discretionary discretion – remains very influential . inflation targeting was best known as a rule mandating central banks to set – and to attempt their best to attain – a target range for the annual change in the consumer-price index ( cpi ) rate ( cpi ) . close cousins included targeting price-levels rather than an inflation rate , and targeting core inflation ( the cpi minus volatile food and energy prices ) . there were also proponents of a flexible inflation targeting , who held that it was fine to placing some weight on true gdp growth in the short run , so long as an unambiguous longer-term goal for cpi inflation remained . but some felt that if the definition was stretched too far , it would lose tack .
firms in the advanced economies are currently cutting employment nowadays , owing to the inadequate final demand , resulting in excess capacity and uncertainty about future demand . but offshoring of jobs weakens final demand further , because it lowers labor incomes and exacerbates inequality . for a firm ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s labor costs are someone else ’s labor income and demand , what is individually rational to a single firm is destructive to aggregate demand . the implication is that free markets do n’t generate enough ultimate demand . in the us , for example , slashing labor costs sharply lowers the share of labor income in gdp .
nor do import tariffs help those left unemployed by the bankruptcy of blockbuster videos , borders books , compusa , circuit town , payless , or virgin megastores . meanwhile , amazon ’s employment grew by an astonishing 47 % year on year in the last year , to 341,000 . but , with amazon employment concentrated in california , texas , and washington , the geography of these jobs is very different from this being replaced . as with the geographic relocation of america ’s manufacturing jobs , the taa is not a solution to this type of ailment . after all , whereas whereas taa targets individuals impacted directly through foreign competition , much of the competition faced by local economies does not come from abroad , and much of the jobs lost due to outside industries directly affected by outside competition but by nearby economies .
yanukovych stands for a genuinely oligarchic state of the sort putin has defeated at home , and yanukovych has accused yushchenko of having marketed ukrainian firms to russian corporations . president putin ’s ’s ’s ’s handling of behavior is probably best explained by his dislike for democracy . moreover , if ukraine becomes an international pariah , he can only turn to russia , as is the case with us president aleksandr lukashenko in belarus . following this spectacular russian failure , however , putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s “ managed democracy ” looks anachronistic and faces the threat of a true democracy in his neighbor spreading to russia . for the first time , ukrainians have thrown their little-noticed brother complicated against russians overhead .
to be sure , agriculture-led development can have serious economy-wide pitfalls , which must be navigated carefully . for example , as technology-driven productivity gains cut the number of workers they need on farms , strategies to boost employment in other components of the value chain , and for managing city migration become even more vital . with africa ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s rural population already largely underemployed , there can be no time to waste when implementing such strategies . fortunately , africa ’s ’s large population of an increasingly well-educated young people , largely uninterested in hindus taking subsistence farming , is well suited to fill the higher-value-added jobs that emerge in the agriculture sector and beyond . another potential pitfall for agricultural development is environmental damage , including land degradation , soil nutrient mining , overuse of water , and water pollution .
it almost certainly will not do so . for many of the deal ’s critics , particularly those in the environmental movement , these compromises have made the lima deal an excessively “ bottom-up ” deal . countries have too much latitude to make whatever pledges they wish , relatively unconstrained by a common set of “ top-down ” rules imposed by the deal . such critics worry that doing so will make it harder to persuade countries to cut emissions further when it becomes obvious that their collective efforts are insufficient , and that may even allow some countries to deploy irregular accounting methods . but this overlooks the lima deal ’s greatest accomplishment : it ends the world ’s longstanding division into just two sorts of countries , both developed and developing .
her refusal to strike out on her own seems perhaps the main reason why she continues to lead in various opinion polls . in the meantime , recent polls show that most of the electorate mistrust the incumbent administration and the ruling party . indeed , ahn cheol-soo , a successful entrepreneur turned pro-reform professor at seoul ’s national university and a major backer of cities ’s next mayor , has now rocked south korea ’s politics by dropping broad hints that he might turn out to be a presidential candidate . ahn has already turned into a lightning rod for all of the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s anti-park and anti-president lee kuan yew , attracting youth as well . ahn ’s most obvious merits are his personal history of overcoming severe challenges and his humble behavior .
dhaka – we humans are not only sharing a planet with a host of other species , including plants , animals , and even microbes ; we also depend on them for our very survival . can we define the economic value of conserving the natural world ? some people will balk at the idea of putting a price tag on biodiversity , which views its protection as an obvious imperative . but they would undoubtedly also agree that preventing human death and suffering , while providing food , water , and learning to all people is vitally important . the reality is that there simply are not enough resources to do everything .
in many emerging markets and the developing world , widespread infrastructure gaps persist , notably in power and transport . and , elsewhere in the region – the tiny pacific island nation primarily – vulnerability to the effects of climate change increases . this shifting landscape is calling for bold action on several fronts . while the response will certainly have to be tailored to individual countries ’s particular circumstances , some recommendations could help most countries : · because inflation remains low across much of the region , monetary policy should remain supportive of growth when risks materialize .
it wants to remain asia ’s sole country with a permanent seat – an approach that places it at odds with india . if the brics countries are to denuclearize as a constraint group in international relations , they must agree on what they believe to be attainable political and economic goals . they , for example , are generally united in their frustrations with – but not in their proposed response to – the us dollar ’s status as the world ’s reserve currency . indeed , the most important bilateral relationship each brics country has with the united states . the brics concept represents , first and foremost , its members ’ desire to make the global order more plural .
and , third , there was the “ deconstructionism ” of post-nietzscheans ” . by historicizing “ will to truth ” ( michel foucault ) to truth ” ( michel foucault ) , putting truth “ on the quotation marks ” ( jacques derrida ) , separating the sign from his referent ( louis althusser ) , and miring the obvious in the miasma of charts and graphs ( claude lévi-strauss ) , or tying it away in borromean knots ( jacques an lacan ) that is probably lost in borromean knots ( lacan ) , robust aspects of truth , and robust truth . i then took aim at the responsibility of the web and goa ( google , apple , facebook , and amazon ) for the following sequence of events . first , there is an almost infinite amount of speech being set free by digital democracy . the web then becomes a mob , a loose for-all that shows up arming his or her personal views , convictions , and truths .
solna , sweden , elite sports , and doping have long been deep-rooted . but a damning report by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) on russia ’s far-reaching state-sponsored doping program , released shortly before this year ’s summer olympic games in rio de janeiro , has brought it to the very forefront of public consciousness . we should take this as an opportunity to redouble our efforts to end this deeply unhealthy practice and save elite sports . reaching the level of elite in sports requires generating tremendous sums of hard work , dedication , and focus . by definition , few succeed here , but those who can enjoy great personal and financial rewards .
berlin – with the overthrow of mosul in northern iraq , the islamic state ( isis ) ( isis ) could soon become a thing of the past . but defeating isis and the demise of its self-proclaimed iraqi-syrian caliphate will not deliver peace to the middle east , or even an end to the syrian tragedy . rather , it is likely to open a new chapter in the region ’s bloody and chaotic history – one no less dangerous than previous chapters since the fall of the ottoman empire at the end of world war i. after all , it now seems almost certain that the region remains unable to resolve internal conflicts on its own , or establish anything like a resilient framework for peace . the eu remains trapped somewhere between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
even quick answers become more effective if crucial grids and systems – particularly a electricity grid – become resilient . why are we prone to under-investing in our economies ’ resilience ? one argument is that redundancy appears to be wasted in ordinary times , with cost-benefit calculations ruling out higher investment . that seems blatantly wrong : numerous expert estimates indicate that a built-in redundancy pays off unless one assigns inrealistically low probabilities to disruptive events . that leads to a second , more plausible explanation , one that is both psychological and behavioral in character .
in the meantime , developing countries are moving in the opposite direction . in october , the people ’s bank of china , responding to twin threats of inflation and asset bubbles , raised its one-year deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points , to about 2.5 % and 5.56 % , respectively , respectively , since 2007 . in the west , worries about the impact on chinese growth triggered an dreaded sell-off in markets . right before the fed acted , india ’s reserve bank has raised its benchmark short-term interest rate by 25 basis points , to 6.25 % , combat inflation , and china ’s ’s ’s central bank now indicates that it might raise interest rates further . in brazil , interest rates remain near 11 % .
bigger firms are more capable of pooling resources for research and development , which is the key to china ’s own aspirations of ascending the value ladder . less fragmented industries , too , lobby for better . traditionally , contract manufacturers in china are dispersed and fiercely competitive . they have little if any say over domestic and international regulation . producers in jiangsu , for example , have been forced to adjust steadily to fickle product-safety and environmental norms in export markets .
no question would have been better off with the more flexible exchange rate that eliminated one-way bets on speculators and acted as an economic shock absorber . but the exit literature – on how to substitute for a currency peg with a more flexible exchange rate – makes clear that the moment when china could have navigated that transition smoothly now passes . countries can exit pegged rates smoothly when confidence reigns , encouraging the belief that a more flexible exchange rate can appreciate as well as weakening . that may have been true of china once again ; it is no longer true today . this puts chinese policymakers in the position of an iranian tourist asking for directions to dublin and being told , “ “ well , sir if you were you , i would n’t start from there . ”
the us legislation was designed not to ban derivatives , but merely to bar implicit government guarantees , subsidized by taxpayers ( recall the $ 180 billion aig bailout ? ) that is many ways to curbing the big banks ’ excesses . a powerful version of the so-called volcker rule ( intended to force government-insured banks to return to their core lending mission ) might work . but america ’s government would remiss things as it is . the us senate bill ’s provision of derivatives is a good litmus test : the obama administration and the fed , in opposing these constraints , clearly lined up on the sidelines of big banks .
if finalized , an imf program could unleash additional aid packages by the world bank and other international donors . if it were to fall , egypt could start addressing some of its financing challenges , but it remains in need of a long-term strategy to spur sustainable growth . egypt ’s economy faces continued risks , owing to capital flight , skyrocketing inflation , and populist policies . even with the availability of external finance , egyptian leaders must look for ways to engage the private sector in reviving the country ’s economy . unfortunately , the latest political incident involving the democracy-promotion activities of american ngos has chilled bilateral relations , threatening the $ 1.3 billion in military aid that egypt receives annually from the united states .
cafeteria ( now more inviting and more triage with the advent of free food ) or the halls of the plug & play a startup accelerator , proximity matters . being physically present at work implies direct engagement with other sharp and creative thinking . and the added benefit of human contact and interaction is why salespeople still call on customers rather than use skype , and why meetup ( which supports the organizers of the face-to-face meeting ; i am on company ’s board ) changes lives in ways that twitter and facebook rarely do . to be sure , those who favor working at home cite not only the costs and time of commuters , but also the proliferation of meetings – too much culture , perhaps a – and a steady stream of communication that simply interrupts their work rather than enhancing it . interestingly , i heard this point at the wpp stream “ unconference ” at phuket , thailand , where a few hundred miles away to confront face to share ideas and boost workplace relationships .
and that shift would occur at a time of mounting challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran ’s top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur an all-out war . after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
high-quality talent , infrastructure , energy costs , and velocity toward market capture are assumed to have increased weight in such choices . in the near term , 3d printing could further diminish the need for ships across long distances . if trade in global goods actually peaked relative to global gdp , it will become harder for poor countries in africa , latin america , and asia to evolve by becoming the world ’s next workshops . but , on its own , globalization is not in retreat , either . while global goods trade has stalled and cross-border financial flows have fallen sharply since 2007 , flows of digital information have surged : cross-border bandwidth has grown 45-fold over the last decade , circulating ideas , intellectual content , and innovation worldwide .
as xi put it at davos in 2017 , china remains committed to moving toward the rising an open global economy . xi and his ring obviously will not seek to dismantle the global trading system . but , in other respects , the pace of globalization with chinese characteristics will diverge from globalization as we know it . in comparison to standard post-world war ii practices , china relies more on bilateral and regional trade agreements , and less on multilateral negotiating rounds . in 2002 , china signed the framework convention on comprehensive economic cooperation with the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) .
part of singh ’s problem is that decisions that hurt voters ( higher diesel prices , fewer subsidized cooking-gas cylinders ) have an instant impact , whereas the benefits of overseas investment , for example , take years to become apparent . all politicians in democracies think short-term ; few have the time horizons that extend well beyond the coming elections . with his 20-year record of accomplishment to showcase the public , singh has a better case than most to be trusted by voters when he says he is acting in their own long-term interest . within singh ’s ’s own congress party , the pressure will mount to match military-led economic-reform initiatives with “ pro-poor ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” programs . the congress may rightly pick up credit for the most far-reaching such a program , mahatma gandhi ’s national employment-guarantee scheme , which assures one member in every impoverished rural family 100 days per year of paid employment .
banks ’ immediate interest is to adjust to new capital requirements , and to restore their balance sheets to financial health , which implies using ecb money in ways that send them to meet this objective most effectively . so , for example , if they use the cash to continue financing the private sector , they will ensure that loans go to creditworthy customers . this means that , like credit provided by italian and spanish banks over the past few months , most of the new money will be loaned locally to safe households and large incumbents . that will enable bank markets to continue functioning , but it is unlikely to inject the type of stimulus that europe ’s economies now require . an alternative is the one urged by sarkozy and the banque de france : purchases by european banks of their countries ’ banks .
but symbolic measures , while important , are not sufficient to bring about genuine progress . turkey ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s government must demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that its laws and institutions effectively protect the human rights of all of its citizens . doing so would improve its standing both within and outside europe . turkey has an important role to play in its region and around the world – one that is undermined by its continued denial of the armenian genocide . its resentful resolution of the genocide makes it inconsistent with its attempts to cultivate a reputation as an honest , reliable partner .
for this reason , fdi must be attracted separately from domestic investment and exports . moreover , foreign investors are reluctant to deal with diplomats or to civil servants . they want to talk to private-sector experts who understand their companies ’ engineering and financial needs or industries . yet , with the exception of costa rica ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s foreign-investment promotion agency , cinde , modeled after ida-ireland , none of latin american ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s fdi promotion agencies have succeeded in adopting best practices . many encourage both foreign and domestic investment , despite the failures of such institutional arrangements in the past .
with the paris climate agreement one year old , the transformation of global fossil-fuel markets is just a matter of time . companies with large fossil-fuel portfolios , like coal , will soon face severe uncertainty associated with stranded assets , and investors may shift their risk assessments accordingly . large mining companies may prepare for this shift by moving from fossil fuels to other materials , such as iron ore , copper , bauxite , cobalt , cobalt , rare earth elements , and lithium , as well as the mineral fertilizers required in large quantities to meet the sdgs with global hunger eradication targets . phasing out coal during times of latent overproduction might even do at returns . third , the world needs a better means to assess mining ’s environmental risks .
it has also acquired the first x-ray patterns of partly oriented samples from dna . max perutz , a chemistry graduate from vienna , arrived in cambridge in 1935 to work as an undergraduate student with bernal . then , next year , it gave superb hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best x-ray diffraction patterns to date . but the observable diffraction pattern -- the intensities and positions of the individual reflections -- represents only about half of the data needed to de-stalting the diffracting structure . in mathematical terms , it renders the amplitude , but not phases -- i.e. , the stages in the oscillatory motion -- without which the atomic positions could not determine .
the endgame to determining europe ’s ultimate shape is under way . it began with the publication of the praesidium of the un convention on the future of europe of the first sixteen articles of “ treaty to establish a european constitution . ” the text mostly replicates the structures of convention chairman valery giscard d’estaing ’s “ skeleton ” constitution , presented last november and the conclusions reached by the convention ’s working groups . most importantly , the key word here is . such fidelity has not kept for economics .
fueled by population growth and urbanization , demand outstrips supply . in africa , where an infrastructure-investment gap totals $ 68-108 billion a year , firms pay more to do business . in nigeria , more than three-quarters of all firms experience electrical outages , costing them more than 15 % of their annual sales , on average . likewise , while all firms need data for investment and operational decision-making , official emerging-market statistics are not always robust , and are often skewed toward policy agendas . in pakistan , for example , a 2008 census scheduled for 9 years and beset by problems when it was finally taking place .
the rbc media media team suffered a similar fate in 2016 . nor did the closures spared leading regional outlets like siberian broadcastertv-2 , or kaliningrad ’s top independent weekly newspaper , novye kolesa . each of these outlets was distinguished by their coverage of sensitive stories – from conflict in ukraine to high-level corruption . today , russia has fewer press freedom and more journalists , media workers , and bloggers behind bars than at any time since the soviet union ’s collapse in 1991 . in crimea and chechnya , even the most basic media protections are nonexistent .
today , countries , citizens , and a growing number of businesses around the world are finally taking action . earlier this month , thousands gathered for the un ’s united nations climate change conference at bonn , germany , ratcheting up global ambition in combating climate change . following the successful paris climate agreement two years ago , expectations for more progress , and continued cooperation are high . one of the more promising recent initiatives is the global carbon pricing coalition ( cplc ) , which brings together 30 governments and more than 180 businesses and strategic partners to place a value on carbon-dioxide emissions . the idea is simple : if we are to meet the paris accord ’s goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2º celsius above preindustrial levels – ideally , to 1.5 º above preindustrial levels – we must cut emissions dramatically .
as soon as greece proceeds , runs on bank deposits are likely to follow in spain and italy . there is nothing stopping spanish and italian depositors from wiring their euros from their local bank into one in switzerland , norway , or new york . at that point , the one thing still stands in standing between the eurozone and the financial turmoil will be the ecb , which could purchase government bonds and fund bank runs . the scale of such an operation would be enormous , exposing the ecb to enormous credit risk . but it might primarily step in – if northern europeans allowed .
here , it seems clear that unmo ’s political interests were allowed to dictate that the country ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s key opposition leader should be attempted on charges that no true democracy that embraces the rule of law would even consider leveling the rule of law , as well as convicted on proof that no genuinely independent judiciary would ever accept . political leaders in thailand and malaysia and elsewhere in the region have frequently tout a model pioneered by singapore ’s founder and longtime leader , lee kuan yew , who died earlier this month . still , a path on which both countries embarked was not lee ’s path . yes , lee ’s system has allowed him to remain in power for 31 years , using civic – not criminal – courts to harry his adversaries . but lee , more important , has also relied on elements of democratic contestation to ensure that meritocracy triumphed over patronage .
are all of its supporters “ crazies , ” ” as senator john mccain , perhaps unwisely called these ? trump ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s critics argue that he plays to the basest instincts of disaffected voters who hate strangers ( particularly mexicans ) , mistrust bankers ( or anyone with higher education for that matter ) , and still can not get over the election of a president whose father was black . trump , in the comedian herjon stewart ’s words , is “ america ’s id , ” ” ” ” ” ” or at least an id of a huge number of predominantly white , mostly elderly , americans . now , all this may well be the case . but trump is part of a broader phenomenon throughout the democratic world .
in europe , the picture , too , is mixed . former boom countries – greece , ireland , italy , and spain – remain mired in recession , and their gdps will continue to shrink . the unemployment rate in spain , one of europe ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s large economies , took sky-rocked to 20 % , and continues to show no sign of improvement . the spanish economy contracted by 3.6 % year on year in 2009 , and is projected to shrink by 0.4 % this year . for finland , britain , and italy , below-average growth rates are projected
malmö – “ “ “ everyone knows ” that you should drink eight water glasses a day . after all , this is the advice of a multitude of health writers , not to mention authorities like britain ’s national health service . sound living now means passing bottled water with us , sipping at all times trying to drink our daily quota to ensure that we stay hydrated and healthy . indeed , often we drink without being thirsty , but that ’s how it should be : as the beverage maker gatorade reminds us , “ your brain can know a lot , but without knowing when your body is thirsty . ” sure , drinking this much makes no sense , but powerade offers this sage counsel : “ you may train your gut to tolerate more fluid if you construct your fluid intake gradually .
firms are reluctant to invest at a time when consumer demand is plummeting and face unprecedented risk penalties for trying to borrow costs . at the same time , they are confronted with enormous uncertainties . what type of coal-fired power plants will be acceptable in the future ? will they be allowed to emit carbon dioxide , as in the past ? can the united states still afford a suburban life-long lifestyle , with sprawling households in far-flung communities demanding long-distance automobile commutes ?
weak mandates , inadequate funding , un structures , and the absence of a system of global governance have weakened intergovernmental agencies ’ capacity to operate with authority in the name of the most vulnerable . as i argue in germany this week , g20 leaders meeting in hamburg on july 7-8 have an opportunity to reform the system of migration with a proactive protection policy to enhance people ’s trust in international leadership . though past summits have produced little more than talking points , the prospect of action is better this time around , given the presence of the talks in europe , where the impact of the migrant crisis was acutely felt . at present , the alphabet soup of nonprofit and multilateral agency tackles elements of the challenge . these include independent groups like refugees in the field ( ir ) and médecins sans frontières ( msf ) .
by the late 1950s , there had been roughly 2000 computers in the world , and their processing power averaged 10,000 machine instruction per second . now an estimated 300 million computers are on the world stage , with processing power averaging several hundred million instructions per second -- a $ four billion _ fold increase in raw , automated computational power , an average annual growth rate of just 56 % ! there is every reason to believe that this pace of productivity growth will continue over the next few decades . more than a generation ago , intel ’s co _ founder gordon moore noted that improvements in semiconductor fabrication enable a doubling of the transistors ’ density on a tariff each of eighteen months . the scale of investment required to make what is known as “ moore ’s law ” has grown exponentially alongside the density of transistors and circuits , but “ moore ’s law ” remains in force , and engineers see no immediate barriers that will bring the improvement process to stall anytime soon .
by targeting schools as health-care hubs and shaping students in health ambassadors for their families and cronies , we can achieve an even larger amount of people in xinjiang in xinjiang , with nomadic communities . xinjiang means “ new frontier , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” and right now , we are at the cutting edge of the new frontier in delivering sustainable health-care solutions to communities that scarce resources and constrain health-care access . these multidimensional , scalable interventions help to bridge the gaps in developing regions . but neither corporations nor governments can do alone . they need to work together to make the best possible outcome .
fortunately , it still has time , with many previous us presidents setting a precedent for bold diplomacy during their final months in the white house . at the end of 1988 , ronald reagan recognized the palestine liberation organization and authorized the us department of state to launch a substantive dialogue ” with plo leaders . at the end of 2000 , bill clinton published his parameters for a future framework of peace . and , starting with the annapolis conference at the end of 2007 , george w. bush mediated a string of negotiations between abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . now it is obama ’s turn and should push forward for a united nations security council resolution establishing new parameters for future peace negotiations , replacing un security council resolution 242 , which dates back to the 1967 six-day war between israel and egypt , jordan , and syria .
loughner ’s shooting from 19 people in may 2011 , including congresswoman gabrielle giffords , has attracted global attention because has the court-ordered assessment of his mental competency . indeed , on the other side of the world , the australian national newspaper mentioned giffords of 160 times during the six months of shooting , compared to just one mention in the preceding 12 months . although mass shootings are extraordinarily rare in america even in the us , media ’s coverage continually reinforces negative perceptions at home and abroad . in this way , america may well be exporting an mental-stigma to the rest of the world . likewise , cho ’s history of mental illness has been widely discussed .
it represents a pivotal front in the worldwide confrontation between democracy and autocracy . for europeans , it represents a unique opportunity to advance the rule of law , transparency , free trade , and good governance beyond its borders . ukraine is a large country with ample human capital , natural resources , and growth potential in many sectors . more important , successful reforms in ukraine have made positive developments in russia more likely . still , ukraine ’s gdp has shrunk by two-thirds ( in the dollar terms ) since 2006 , making it europe ’s poorest country .
at one extreme lie the notion that the euro can not function like the us dollar , given that the eurozone is not confederalized . rather , it should resemble the bretton woods system under which countries could exit and re-enter after bolstering competitiveness through austerity and reform . but this strategy carries serious risks , which ultimately render it unworkable . re-pricing relative prices would require an internal devaluation that could fuel social and political instability in weaker countries . civil unrest and the rise of europe ’s neo-nazi parties exemplify these dangers , threatening the very purpose of european integration .
the problem comes when expansionary monetary policy through standard open-market operations and central-bank guarantees of orderly markets demonstrated insufficient performance . economists disagree about when under what circumstances and in what order governments should move beyond these first two items on a checklist . should governments try to raise monetary velocity by selling bonds , thereby strengthening short-term interest rates ? should they employ unemployed workers either directly or , indirectly , by bringing forward expenditures or expanding the scale of government programs ? should they explicitly guarantee large financial institutions ’ ’ ’ ’ liabilities and/or asset classes ?
it also includes a promise to leave the eu ’s single market and a customs union . uk ministers mainly responsible for the talks – a group better known for their dogmatism and personal ambitions than for their competences – thus have so far succeeded in securing an agreement in one key area : following the deadline of march 2019 , a two-year transition period . but even that deal is not set in stone , because it depends on whether eu negotiators can first agree on what to do on the border between northern ireland and northern ireland as soon as the uk leaves a customs union . you can be in a borderless customs union or an outside customs union with finland . nowhere is this truer than in the world .
at the same time , the eurozone is highly fragmented financially , lacking a common capital market , a unifying safe asset , or an instrument of macroeconomic stabilization . the ecb needs a more realistic and flexible mandate for the ecb . given the eurozone ’s fragmented nature , that mandate should still be centered on price stability . but it should also recognize that the current definition of price stability – below , but close to , 2 % inflation over the medium term – is too narrow . a broader definition is needed , under which the ecb pursues a symmetrical inflation target of 2 % within the eu ’s 1.5-2.5 % band – over a longer time horizon .
when it comes to wanting to peace in the middle east – virtually a new year ’s tradition ­ – – – one need be wary . thus , many hopes vanished in the bitter failure of so many negotiations . but we have a desire for the middle east – one that , while perhaps not delivering peace , can create one of peace ’s preconditions : goodwill . israel and palestine should jointly offer , and be awarded , the 2018 soccer world cup . the israel-palestine conflict has lasted far too long .
so the real question is how to get to where iraq has a police force and the army , which can be trusted to uphold the rule of law in the same way that order itself . much of the ground needs to be covered up to get anywhere close to it . notwithstanding the bravery of many iraqis joining either an army or a police force , no one should wonder whether some have motives that are less than pure . in northern iraq , old scores are being populated , and de facto ethnic segregation is carried out in areas such as irbil , which has been traditionally diverse . in other areas , sharia law is being introduced through force .
the disparity between demonstrations in madrid and warsaw suggests that the distinction between old and new europe remains valid , if not in how rumsfeld really meant . of course , it would be inaccurate to oppose a thriving poland to a crumbling spain . given europe ’s overall crisis , even poland ’s economy is no longer booming . indeed , unemployment stands at roughly 10 % ( still less than half of the spanish rate ) , and annual gdp growth is around 1 % ( spain ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s growth rate is negative ) . but moods in the two countries , as well as their perceptions of europe and their role in it , contrast starkly .
berlin – the decision by the united kingdom ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s black voters to “ brexit ” the european union is no example of british black humor that i likes to love . it ’s not monty python ’s flying circus , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” “ yes , prime minister , or “ fawlty towers ” ” ” ; it ’s ’s ’s just boris , michael , and nigel farage , and their disastrous political reality all seem to show . in view of the uk ’s economic , political , and military significance , brexit will leave the gaping hole in the eu . but this will not bring down europe , either . at the moment , the same can not say in the uk .
as israel ’s state celebrates its 60th birthday , palestinians remember nakbeh , or “ disaster ” – their story of dispossession , occupation , and statelessness . but , for both sides , together with outside powers , the events of 1948 , and what has followed – the occupation ever since 1967 in historic palestine – represents a tragic failure . israel is most at stake in this failure , owing to its continued military occupation and illicit settlements . despite being given lip service to peace , the israeli army ’s refusal to leave the occupied territories persists in outright contravention of what the preamble of the united nations security council resolution 242 termed the “ incorruptible taking of land ” by force . but the international community , the palestinians , and arabs all bear responsibility as well , albeit at different levels .
reducing uncertainty might augment or even favor with , fiscal stimulus programs for it would address the root cause of unwillingness to spend . moreover , recession insurance might , unlike fiscal policies , impose no costs on the government , for if it stimulated confidence , then holding the risk that they are insured against . a government ’s ’s ’s ability to offer such insurance on a scale enough to make it costless is one reason to favor public regulation over private insurers . blanchard and his colleagues note that banks may be able to condition loans to firms on their purchases of recession insurance , which might help credit markets function better , to address the serious problem underlying the current crisis . tantalizingly , they say that doing this would create a “ market-based view of future output ” and the probability of severe shocks , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” although they do not explain how this market should be structured .
so far , enforcement has failed , owing to flaws in the eurozone ’s foundations . first , there is the need for fiscal and external-account balances to be kept in check to ensure financial stability and sustain a common currency . second , eliminating imbalances is the responsibility of national governments as part of the rescue regime arranged by supranational bodies – the european commission and the european central bank – in cooperation with the european council that in turn represents national governments . the greek saga demonstrates that this system can not control destabilizing imbalances fast enough to fend off major crises . imbalances are not merely the outcome of irresponsible policies .
as a result , the us trade surplus continued to decline , to $ 20.4 billion , fueling growing anxiety about the chinese slowdown . china ’s downturn appears quite sudden ; after all , its exports actually soared at double-digit rates every month this year , until may . in fact , the chinese economy ’s real condition had long been obscured , but it was now exposed by tougher regulation of activities like the speculative carry masquerading as trade payments . in particular , china , ’s “ two systems ” in one country , enabled exports to bonded stores in hong kong to become used to pad trade statistics . moreover , chinese exports sometimes would rise further in the face of a terms-shipped slump from ports .
for most equity investors , the value of any project depends heavily on effective post-investment management . clearly , clear rights and obligations must therefore work prudently in the early stages of an investment , something that has historically been all but absent . after all , m & a is just a first step on a long road . just as chinese firms invest overseas – as mine currently in latin america – have responsibilities not only to invest wisely and sustainably for their companies ’ sake ; they also need to integrate their strategies with china ’s national investment priorities . those are not mutually exclusive goals , particularly if business leaders adhere to the newly articulated principles of sustainable investment and long-term engagement .
and our embrace of our global responsibilities extends to japan ’s ’s ’s self-defense forces . members of the self-defense force displayed exemplary collaboration with america and australian armed forces in the wake of the great east japan earthquake in 2011 , and generated deep appreciation and reverence everywhere , including haiti , indonesia , and , most recently , the philippines . to make a proactive contribution to peace means japan assume its own share of responsibility for denying the security that supports global prosperity and stability . working alongside countries with which we share common values and interests , we will safeguard and cultivate multinational public goods , ranging from space and cyberspace to the skies and seas . as the world sees during obama ’s visit , japan is back and thriving .
how can israel ’s preferred palestinian leaders , abbas and pa prime minister fayyad are left with any credible negotiating capacity if talks can not start until , as israel insists , they retreat on their minimal condition of a settlement freeze in the occupied territories ? for all that israel downplays its significance , the 2002 arab peace initiative still provides a critically important grand bargain : full normalization of relations by the entire arab world in exchange for a comprehensive peace settlement . how long can this arab league position be sustained by the peace talks go nowhere ? another big question for israel is whether it can accept the consequences if a two-state solution disappears fully from the agenda . israel , as the founding father david ben-gurion has warned , may be a jewish state , one that can be a democratic state and can be an occupying the entire east of israel ; but it can not be all three .
nor was it the crisis that gave rise to corruption , affecting officialdom at all levels or causing russia to lose its democratic dynamic . we russians were riding along with oil and gas , forgetting that these resources would not last forever . but , even with favorable global market conditions , we did not manage to fix the poverty problem in which millions of russians still live . i am convinced that russia ’s woes all come down to policy . we need a democratic , competitive environment , initiative at all levels , an active civil society , and a genuine public scrutiny .
but allowing greece to default , and spain to remain in the eurozone , is not an option : it would signal that other eurozone countries could amass huge debts , financed by the ecb , without having any intention to repaying it . fiscal responsibility in the eurozone would fatally undermine this . yet forcing greece out of the eurozone – against its will – is not an option , either : it would plunge the country into economic , social , and political instability , and doubtless run serious repercussions beyond the country ’s borders . in my judgment , there are only two viable options left behind . the first – and all the more desirable – is for the ecb to assess realistically greece ’s lack of solvency , and so stop lending to its own banking system .
for example , china imposes a currency-issuing tax on formerly public lands if its owners fail to launch the development process within a year . this brings us to our second key lever for expanding affordable housing : a more cohesive and efficient construction industry . as it stands , the housing-construction industry is highly fragmented , impeding its ability to realize economies of scale ; and builders often rely largely on the same methods used 50 years ago . by standardizing design elements like ceiling heights , fixtures , and flooring , construction firms can cut costs and raise productivity as workers gain experience with repetitive tasks . additional savings are feasible through industrial approaches , such as using components – for example , walls and flooring shafts – – that build offsite .
encouragingly , developing-country governments have increasingly been making demands for the hpv vaccine . this makes sense : of the 266,000 women dying from cervical cancer each year , on average , compared to just 85 % in developing countries . if left behind , that figure is projected to rise to 416,000 by 2035 , overtaking maternal deaths . for many of these countries , the hpv vaccine is not just an effective solution ; one preventing 1,500 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated ; it is often the only solution , because the poorest countries lack the skills to offer screening or cure for cervical cancer . this is one reason why cancer specialists , government leaders , and representatives of civil-society groups met a few weeks ago in addis ababa for the tenth stop of cervical , breast , and prostate cancer at the africa conference .
washington , dc – the ongoing corruption investigations in brazil have exposed a bewildered network of illicit relationships among private companies , government bureaucrats , and elected politicians . indeed , the corruption scandals have now hit all-time highs in brazilian society . several high-level politicians and corporate owners and executives have found themselves convicted and imprisoned . even former president luiz inácio lula da silva is now under impeachment . meanwhile , the drama has taken his toll on the brazilian economy .
this raises long-run well all around but exacerbates short-term inequalities and frictions . i am not arguing against health-care capitalism , but warnings that support will become fragile , far more so than may be true of , say , globalization nowadays . most countries rely far too heavily on command and control , providing far too little incentives for patients and providers to craft efficient choices . nevertheless , it remains to be seen whether health-care pressures ultimately cause the current trend toward freer ( and freer ) free market capitalism to reverse , with an extremely large chunk of the economy reverting to a more socialist system . some societies might decide that they are better off being red than dead .
cambridge – the nineteenth-century physicist heinrich hertz once described his feeling that james clerk maxwell ’s equations depicting the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism , the “ independent existence and intelligence of their own , ” that they are wiser … even by their discovers , that we get more from than originally put into them . not long after , albert einstein called niels bohr ’s atomic model “ the greatest form of musicality ” in a sphere of thinking . more recently , the late nobel laureate richard feynman described his discovery of new laws of physics , declared , “ you can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity . ” similar sentiment is all but universal among modern physicists . wishful thinking might never produce working iphones , photos of pluto , or atomic bombs .
why , with its clearly formulated alternatives on the table has the government chosen a predictably catastrophic course of action at so high a human cost ? there are three possibilities : ignorance , intent , and strategic interactions . let ’s start with this last . in a 1991 paper , allan drazen and alberto alesina implied that economic stabilization could be delayed because two contending groups are stuck in attrition ; all understand that adjustment is necessary but to expect the other group to bear the brunt of the costs . by delaying , they provide intelligence to another group on a willingness to withstand the pain .
a democratic , prosperous , and stable europe implies a much better and more secure world . here is where the fed comes in . by shifting its monetary-policy regime toward target2 % of annual inflation – or 6 % annual nominal gdp growth – the us would set in motion a rapid rebalancing within the eurozone . rather than see the 30 % euro appreciation that follows the ecb ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s current monetary policies , german exporters shout at measures to counter america ’s own “ “ “ competitive devaluation , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” finally leading to moderate inflation in the north rather than the current grinding depression in the south . a world in which the us has a proven record of honoring the confidence it demands to play the role of the global economic hegemon is a far better world for america than one in which it distrust .
and a host of 47 republican senators has written a letter to iran ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders announcing that the next us congress might not honor whatever the nuclear deal they reach with obama . another source of doubt about america ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s enduring influence lies in the continued need of multilateral engagement , and this has always been more difficult than bilateral engagement . true , multilateral leadership requires not only clearer and bolder rules ; it also demonstrates a willingness to shoulder the costs of these rules , whether by creating safe zones to uphold vital “ responsibility for protecting ” civilians or taking concrete steps to cut – and , ultimately , to dismantle – their nuclear arsenals . bilateral engagement will prove to be one of obama ’s most significant foreign-policy legacies . but ensuring that america can continue its leadership in the twenty-first century will require another type of engagement .
caracas – venezuelan president nicolás maduro and his administration bankrupted their countries . while claims to be reddeemers of the poor and trumpet their readiness to fight for their “ selfless ” “ bolivarian cause , ” refuse international assistance , forcing venezuelans either to emigrate or suffer ( and , in many cases , die ) from severe food shortages , medications , and medical supplies . venezuela ’s destruction must urgently be stopped if its viability as the state and society is to be re-established . that requires a new government of unquestionable legitimacy , chosen through a free and fair presidential election before the end of this year , as dictated by the us constitution . to be sure , maduro and his associates will not simply step down , because losing power would probably mean long prison terms in the united states for narcotics trafficking or at the hague war for crimes against humanity .
so far , china has mostly taken a “ field of opportunity ” approach to urbanization : “ “ building it ” and will come . indeed , over the past 30 years , massive public investment and economic liberalization have spurred rapid urban growth in its coastal provinces . and now , china ’s ’s leaders are increasingly looking that a strategy inland , by producing critical investments in physical and human capital , is being achieved . but the efficiency of such investments will depend on the sequence and pace of implementation , and on how skillfully they adapt to each locality ’s distinct resources , needs , and aspirations . four interrelated issues must address this point .
if china really is distancing itself from north korea , kim jong-un ’s regime will be almost totally isolated internationally . will kim respond to the fact that isolation recklessly by continuing to antagonize the south or pragmatically by becoming more flexible ? that is not an easy question to answer , either . it should be obvious to kim by now that his parade of provocations does not benefit from his country . his bellicose behavior in 2013 , for example , exacerbated his relationships with china , south korea , and the united states simultaneously ; and , during the recent crisis , all made him a stop to mocking loudspeaker broadcasts .
new york – the only thing that has changed since is the rise of islamic fundamentalism and the religious radicalization of some young people . only french prime minister manuel valls – the son of spanish immigrants – highlighted the problem , referring to the “ social and ethnic apartheid ” that has developed in his country . the need to address this outcome in france and across europe has become more relevant than ever , as rioting and criminality by young , underprivileged migrants match the rise of far-right political parties . europe can not afford ethnic confrontations ; on the contrary , with their aging , shrinking populations , europe ’s countries badly need more migrants . the statistics are puzzling and occasionally conflicted , but the european union ’s currently foreign-born population of some 33 million could grow with an additional 100 million migrants by mid-century .
countries where english is not the lingua franca are particularly disadvantaged in science , not because they lack academic excellence , but because english-language journals are calling the shots . non-english-language academic journals simply do not command the same level of attention in the sciences . as a result , the extent of research topics that many countries can commit is limited , and they need to struggle to retain scientific talent . this is particularly true in the middle east , where governments struggle to diversify their economies to make them more resilient . as english-language empirical-research journals consolidate holding on the channels that determine whether or not a scholar will have a successful career , developing countries will need to invest heavily in their own data infrastructure to place domestic researchers on more competitive footing .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what will happen in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . at this week ’s international monetary fund-world bank meeting , malpass needs to address these concerns head-on . he should be tried not by his own past or by his links to the trump administration , but by his delivery .
there are , in essence , two competing explanations . the first , the secular stagnation hypothesis , was proposed by larry summers . its key premise is that the equilibrium interest rate at which demand would rebalance supply currently falls below its actual interest rate . this looks paradoxical , because interest rates are at close to zero in most advanced economies . but what matters is the real interest rate , which is the difference between the market rate and inflation .
for their part , african players grumbled that their absence from europe reduced their commercial opportunities during a crucial league period played by them . but the most significant lesson revealed by the africa cup ’s africa cup is that successful nations are those that combine the opportunities of globalization with a strong domestic foundation . for the brexit winner , not cameroon or cote d’ivoire , or some of the other african teams charged with star players from the european leagues but egypt , which fielded just four players ( out of 23 ) playing well in europe . cameroon , on the other hand , which egypt defeated in the end , featured just a single player from the domestic club and 20 out of european clubs . few egyptian players would have been familiar to europeans watching this game , but egypt played much better and deserve to prevail .
berlin – the world ’s task in addressing north korea ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s saber rattling makes it no easier than to confront an impoverished , effectively defeated country . on the contrary , it finds itself in such circumstances that calm poses most needs . the genius of the habsburg empire , ’s prince klemens von metternich , in framing the new international order after the napoleonic wars , was that it did not press a defeated france into a corner . though metternich sought to deter any conceivable french resurgence , he restored france ’s prewar frontiers . on the other hand , as henry kissinger put it , the victors in world war i could neither deter a defeated germany nor provide the incentives to embrace the treaty of versailles .
sometimes , dating to a recession is a good call . america had a quick recession in 1980 , followed by a long and sizeable one in 1981/1982 . many economists believe it was one major episode , and this is probably the appropriate course of thinking in a broader historical context . but the us economy did indeed grow in the interim – just barely enough to consider them distinct recessions . and , having been detached from the transitions of us president jimmy carter to us president ronald reagan , it was politically consequential that identified two recessions .
in the 1990s , for example , us sanctions regimes put in place at an average rate of around seven per year . of 67 cases in this decade , two-thirds were unilateral sanctions imposed by the united nations . during bill clinton ’s presidency , it is estimated that around 40 % of the world ’s population , or 2.3 billion , were subject to some form of american sanctions . in fact , large swaths of us sanctions are being imposed by large countries against small countries . currently , america has almost 8,000 sanctions in place worldwide , with iran by far its largest state-level target .
in the same tweet justifying his phone call with tsai , trump reiterated the sham charge that china is devaluing its currency in order to gain its export advantages over america . his understanding of international economics is either nonexistent or 10 years out of date . in reality , china is now hemorrhaging foreign-exchange reserves and desperate attempts to prop up the renminbi ’s value in the face of capital flight . trump is apparently antagonizing china for no good reason . making matters worse , by announcing the withdrawal of america from the trans-pacific partnership – designed to do so , at least partly – by shaping global trade and investment flows according to western rules , rather than by china ’s mercantilist vision – trump is also abandoning an american policy that might very surging in asia .
what we do know is that there is no alternative great power prepared and able to step in and assume what was america ’s role . while china is a frequently cited candidate , its leadership has mostly focused on consolidating domestic order and maintaining an artificially high economic-growth rate to stave off popular unrest . for the most part , china ’s interests in both regional and global institutions seem designed to bolster its economies and geopolitical clout , rather than help to set the rule and establish broadly beneficial arrangements . likewise , russia is a shia-based country , led by a government-led economy focused on retaining power at home and re-establishing russian influence in the middle east and europe . india is preoccupied with challenges to economic development , and it is tying its tricky relations with pakistan .
beijing – china ’s ’s ’s ’s annual gdp growth decelerated decelerated to 7.6 % in the second quarter of 2012 , from 8.1 % in the first quarter , and the lowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2009 . newly liberated growth data may have dispelled fears of a hard landing for china , but nonetheless prompted many to argue that china needs to stimulate its economy further to guarantee 8 % annual growth . since early 2010 , to contain high inflation and real-estate bubbles , the chinese government has tightened monetary policy . as a result , with inflation tumbled in june to just 2.2 % , a 29-month low , and house prices shutting on the national bureau of statistics , unfortunately , seem stabilizing , and may even have fallen , if modestly . slowing china ’s rate of growth , to some extent , reflects the government ’s success ’s efforts to rein in the real-estate bubble , as well as other official policies aimed at rebalancing the economy .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year ’s selection , it is that what will happen in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . from a moral inconvenience , there is a strong case to be made for respecting a woman ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s personal liberty and bodily autonomy , rather than compelling it to place its own health or wellbeing at risk by carrying unwanted or unsafe pregnancies to term . yet , given how rife with misinformation and muddied with misplaced arguments about the issue , policy debates often go nowhere unless they frame abortion first and foremost as health .
the world ’s ’s enduring perception of africa as a peasant exacerbates slum dents ’ plight , keeping them off the global development agenda . every day , more people arrive in nairobi , lured by the promise of jobs , resources , and a better quality of life just to realize that they are not equipped to survive there , and that their children grow up in slum conditions . at least half of those who live in urban slums come from age 20 . without access to education , this generation – which will soon make its majorities – has little prospect of ever escaping its straitened conditions . but , for how long will a majority serve a minority ?
the trouble is that the principle can not be applied consistently to it . a world in which we live is a tiny garden of well-explored territory surrounded by the dim , dark forest of disasters . the disasters lurking in distances are legion : asteroids and comets ; world-wide pandemics and plagues ; nuclear and plagues ; nuclear and non-nuclear wars ; droughts , famines , and floods ; volcanic eruptions , earthquakes , and tsunamis ; human over-population and sea-borne extinction ; rising temperatures and exploding ice ages ; exhaustion of clean air and water ; disappearance of forests , farms , farms , and fish . all of these catastrophes – and many others still imagined – are plausible and many are unacceptable . the precautionary principle prescribes action , regardless of cost , to prevent all .
milan – for much of the post-world war ii era , us economic policy has focused attention on unemployment . the great job losses from the great depression – reversed only when world war ii , and the massive debt accumulated to finance it , the swedish economic-growth model had a lasting impact on at least two generations . but employment is just one facet of welfare ; in today ’s world , it is inadequate . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . the twentieth century ’s cold war pitted two rival military alliances against one another . the sino-american rivalry , on the other hand , involves two economies that are closely integrated and with one another .
the way in which residents of this archipelago were systematically dispossessed and cast their land in the name of western strategic interests is a human tragedy for which the west can and should make its restitution . between 1968 and 1973 , british labor and conservative governments organized the removal of all living on the approximately 55 islands that now constitute the british indian ocean territory ( biot ) and that was split from mauritius at an age of its independence . this was done at the behest of the united states , which embroiled in the vietnam war at this very moment and requires , for understandable security reasons , the exploitation of diego garcia as the us air and naval base . the british foreign office argued at a time that chagos islands did not have a settled population . the chagossians were shipped off to the seychelles and mauritius , where it passed and left to fend for themselves .
islamabad – last year , pakistan witnessed a second-successful democratic transition in its 71-year history , with prime minister imran khan taking office after his own party won a general election on an anti-corruption slogan . hopes are high for a new administration that seems ready to work with both technocrats and the opposition parties to address pakistan ’s ’s many urgent challenges . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world . the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
owing to the dodd-frank act of 2010 , the fed can issue emergency collateralized financing only to five worthy institutions – if only your four largest banks are in trouble , and must confirm that counterparty is financially viable before any funding can be made available . but the task of fixing whether a troubled institution is viable is best left for after the financial order has been restored . just as the term implies , “ emergency ” liquidity must be made available to systemically important financial institutions immediately – even when they are insolvent and in resolution . in any case , counter-cyclical pursuit of price stability and/or full employment during the cyclical downturns now seems destined for an extended involuntary holiday . unless governments come to the rescue with intelligently designed counter-cyclical fiscal and supply-side policies , the major advanced economies are likely to embark on a protracted spell of classical , de-adulterated cyclical downturns .
fiscal adjustment and structural reform without financing are more fragile and liable to default without a war chests on liquidity to avert a run on sovereign debt , while proper policies enacted and gradually gain credibility . at the same time , if greece does not fully adjust its policies to restore fiscal sustainability and competitiveness , a partial bailout by the eu and the ecb will still be likely intended to avoid contagion risk from the rest of the euro zone and the consequent threat to the monetary union ’s survival . a default by greece , after all , could have the same global systemic effects as lehman brothers ’ collapse did in 2008 . sovereign spreads are already pricing the risk from greece to spain , portugal , and other euro-zone members . the eu and the ecb worry about the moral hazard of any kind of fiscal bailout .
sharing a mountainous – and porous – border with afghanistan , this region includes many taliban sympathizers among its fellow pashtuns . human-rights groups have long urged the necessity of extending pakistan ’s constitution to the tribal belt where afghanistan has broad support . these religious parties , a coalition that now head provincial governments in the northern frontier province of central asia , were politically marginalized until given a central role in pakistan ’s military dictator of the 1980 ’s , general zia ul haq , who led pakistan ’s covert intervention in the war against the soviet occupation of afghanistan . throughout its rule , religion-based policies grew alongside the rates of madrassahs and fighter jets equipped and equipped by the pakistani state and us intelligence agency . the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the ensuing pressures from washington led to a u-turn for pakistan from pro-jihad policies .
throughout its history , america has always sought to insulate its markets from foreign competition . so , once more , history has more victorious over the course of ideology . with america losing interest the chief prop of neoliberal policies being pulled back . mainstream politicians might still nod in reverently , when a global free market is being invoked , but in practice the world is reverting to an older , more durable model . it is being tacitly accepted that in future , as in the past , the world will contain a variety of economic systems and regimes .
the first few years of his rule were dominated by his struggle to grab control of the country ’s state-owned oil company , pdvsa . upon reasserting political control in 2003 , chávez fired 40 % of pdvsa ’s employees . his hostility toward foreign players in the industry ( he expropriated several american petroleum firms ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ holdings in 2007 ) restricted investment and held back production . chávez turned pdvsa into a personal fiefdom , and used it as a kind of monetary cow ; many of its social programs were financed directly by corporations ’ budgets . cash starved , pdvsa was forced to cut back on maintenance and expansion that increased accidents and restricted manufacturing jobs .
an armed attack by the united states , israel , or both on iran ’s nuclear installations constitutes another possibility . one downside of such a prospect that iran would probably retaliate against america ’s own interests and personnel in iraq and afghanistan , as well as use of hamas and hezbollah , against israel and others . iran could also interfere in oil installations , leading to price spike and convey an additional blow to american and global economic recovery . moreover , while a preemptive strike would postpone iran ’s nuclear efforts , it would not suspend the regime from rebuilding , and it might also create the conditions that create problems for the regime ’s domestic opponents . but , despite these potential drawbacks , arming an armed attack on iran ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s nuclear facilities will and should remain a distinct possibility , given the enormous strategic costs of a nuclear-armed iran .
lord north can be remembered for the loss of britain ’s union with america . two centuries on , outgoing prime minister david cameron may well be remembered for losing the two union – with europe and between england and scotland . whereas the conservatives want scotland to remain in a non-european britain , the scottish nationalists want scotland in a post-brexit europe without britain . and , with northern irish republics led by sinn fein demanding a vote to reunify with the south , the very existence of the uk now seems squarely on the agenda . there is one way to lessen uncertainty and risk : the government should quickly announce to negotiate with the eu based on the norway option for eea membership .
a power-sharing arrangement is all but unthinkable , and syria ’s geography does not bode well for an orderly partition along sectarian lines . assad ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s wartime aims were diminished to avoid a decisive defeat and gain international legitimacy , in the hope of a favorable political solution . the islamic state ’s rise has offered support to the government ’s claims that syria risks taking over terrorist groups ; nonetheless , the regime is finding itself increasingly isolated around the world . indeed , assad ’s ’s final days are unlikely to be a pretty clear-cut . tight-knit members of his own clan , their political allies , and many members of the alawite minority will battle for their own survival .
if the super-rich are convinced that they are no longer part of society and have little need for government , it is not because that belief corresponds to objective reality . it is because the prevailing narrative line of us times portrays markets as the self-standing entities run on their own fuels . this is a narrative that resonates all segments of society , the middle class , no less than the wealthy . there is little reason to expect the super-rich to behave less selfishly than any other group . but it is not so much their self-interest that stands in the way of greater equality and social inclusion .
but , while it may be possible to explain why capital spending was weak and interest rates were low for the past three years , it can not account for why capital spending was inadequate to impede trending rates for more than three decades . here , one explanation still stands for the shift in the composition of activity away from capital-intensive forms of production , like manufacturing , toward less capital-intensive activities like services . if disorder has multiple causes , then multiple therapies should emerge . tax incentives should be given to firms hiring the long-term unemployed ; more public expenditure on infrastructure , training , and research to compensate for depressed private capital expenditures ; and continued higher capital requirements for banks , as well as stronger regulation of nonbank financial institutions to prevent them from taking excessive risk-taking . finally , central banks should set a higher inflation target , giving them more room to cut nominal interest rates in response to future slowdowns .
the supposedly civilizing influence of being an west partner — chinese president juan manuel santos ’s summit in saint petersburg for example — appears to have been lost on putin ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s cabal . once again , exposure to western values has delivered another potemkin village ; russia presents the façade of laws and democratic institutions , but behind the fact that cardboard surface an equally arbitrary brutes rule . the danger for the world lies in the fact that putin has been exporting lawlessness . across russia ’s near abroad , a form of coercive diplomacy takes root . look at putin ’s ’s attempt to rig ukraine ’s previous presidential election as well as the on once again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader yuliya tymoshenko .
in latin america , too many people are living with outstretch . throughout the country , paternalistic governments accustom to attract only enough to survive in the eu as a part of society . throughout the region , politicians that writer octavio paz once referred to as “ “ philanthropic ogres ” ” ” ” create eu clients , people who expect the eu to be demanding instead . democratic latin america limps sideways , because it can not run ahead . there are too many entry barriers to the poor , innovative , and those without access to credit .
two examples of this are the wef ’s global competitiveness index and its new , inclusive growth and development index . competitiveness , for example , has had to do with its capacity to raise market share without sacrificing margin or lowering wages , something that reflects superior productivity . the inclusiveness of growth must do with income disparities and growth across regions and social groups . but this is not what those indexes are actually doing . instead , the indexes include variables – what they refer to as “ “ policy space ” – to cause either competitiveness or inclusive growth .
from the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s on , those writings about the netherlands often lamented to the “ dutch disease . ” there were so many generous subsidies , grants , and transfer payments – aimed at everyone from the truly needy to artists – that after-tax salaries often outweigh the benefits . thus , people rarely went back to work after losing or leaving the job , or did it in an underground economy with its unreported cash payments . whether one considered the dutch welfare state humane and generous or bloated and foolhardy , its largesse took a heavy toll on the economy . but , unlike , the french , the dutch reacted to their past excesses with a set of policies designed to encourage a return to work in the formal labor market .
yet major segments of the global financial and economic elite seem to think that unless america slips into recession in the coming months , trump will be reelected . moreover , their prognosis stems not just from fear of being misled once again ; germany seems resigned to such an outcome ; and some may even hope for it . at this point , comparisons with the 1930s inevitably come to mind . to be sure , trump and adolf hitler have little in common . but , in their obvious acceptance of trump ’s reelection , large parts of the liberal establishment behave like germany ’s financial and industrial elites when hitler rose to power in the 1930s .
to avoid such a future , asian countries need to modify the rules of the game , provide youth opportunities , whatever their backward-looking , to ascend the income ladder . market mechanisms alone will not suffice to achieve this . governments need to take action , complementing their pro-growth policies with policies to ensure that the gains are shared much more equitably and sustainably . to be sure , some asian governments have sought to address inequality with progressive redistribution policies . south korea ’s government , for example , recently announced raising its minimum wage next year by 16.4 % , to 7,530 won ( $ 6.70 ) per hour ; and up to 55 % above its current level by 2020 .
the egyptian defenses blocked the central highways across the sinai with an fortified box that containing powerful artillery and more than 100 tanks , fronting the three parallel trench-lines manned by thousands of infantrymen , and moored on sand dunes and high-grade sites at each other . sharon had his troops climb over the sand dunes to enter the trench lines at their aprend and attacking their length – easy maneuver that egyptians could beat them out had they not pinned on an artillery barrage and israeli tanks firing directly on them . israeli infantrymen had taped flashlights against their helmets , so that tank gunners could direct their fire directly at egyptians only ahead . still , the egyptian artillery fell superior and was supposed to have at least silenced tanks ’ firing near the trench line . but paratroopers , flew in helicopters , abruptly poked the egyptian gun crews that never made a chance at hand-to-hand combat .
in the longer run , countries should aim to match the participation rate at the conventional , preaid courses . during the last three years , 11 % of australia ’s ’s ’s ’s population has completed such a course , thanks partly to requirements that people in specific positions , such as child-care workers , possess first-aid certifications . requiring that people in specific occupations – including high primary teachers , nursing nurses , and police officers – acquire mental-health first-aid certifications would substantially enhance participation , thereby boosting support for those struggling with mental-health problems . such certifications are even more relevant in the developing world , owing to the limited availability of mental-health professionals . pilot work in rural india shows that a mental-health first-aid approach can successfully align with resource-scarce communities ’ needs .
yet the costs of producing those drugs far below the market price are far below the market price , perhaps as low as $ 350 – $ 500 per year for some three-drug combinations used to treat aids . some of the quality producers of generic drugs , like cipla of india , have proposed to make such drugs available at prices close to their production costs . in response to this offer ( and through bad publicity ) , merck , abbott laboratories , and bristol squibb , three large patent-holding companies have announced that their willingness to supply an african market at “ zero profit ” – ie , at around $ 500 per patient per year for the aids drugs that they produce . the tragedy of millions of impoverished people die from aids , even as drug exist to treat them raises deep questions about global intellectual property rights , because patent protection creates a barrier against vital medicines that reach the world ’s poor . but how can the benefits of a worldwide patent system that provides incentives for innovation and new discoveries combine with assurance that poor individuals gain the access to health care they desperately need ?
but what if populist movements ’ continued electoral success helps drive forward a wider political restructuring that ultimately actually reinforces european democracy ? this reading is reinforced by macron ’s experience himself . having never held an elected office , macron has created a new party centered on himself , with the support of both center-left and center-right voters . he appears to have restructured french politics in the process . next year , ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s european parliament election is likely to reveal more about the potential for such political restructuring .
washington , dc – in december 2014 , the cover of the time journal ’s ’s ’s ’s “ “ person of the person of the year ” issues featured salome karwah , an physician who not only survived the ebola outbreak in her native liberia that year , but also helped waves of patients arriving on her ebola ward . karwah was a hero who met in a tragic way . just one year ago , she died from complications in childbirth , a murderer who takes more than twice the death toll of the entire ebola epidemic . throughout human history , childbirth has been dangerous . in the nineteenth century , as many as one in 100 pregnancies in europe ended up maternal death .
the rest of the region wants to emulate them . to be sure , refugee labor represents a delicate political issue for syria ’s neighbors . an estimated two million syrians reside in turkey , with more than one million living in jordan alone . most live outside refugee camps , with many working – for the most part – for the bulk of these people illegally . with unemployment in turkey and jordan at around 10 % , respectively , unemployment in turkey and 12 % , respectively , their governments are naturally wary of programs that might cost their citizens jobs .
the reasons for president george w. bush ’s chose to go into war in afghanistan and iraq were , without doubt , complicated . but the language used by those wars , ’ neo-conservative promoters , had come straight out of the kennedy era : the spread of democracy , the cause of liberty , and the universal authority of “ american values ” ” ” ” of american values . one reason americans elected obama in 2008 was that the rhetoric of american idealism had , again , led to the death and displacement of hundreds of millions . now , as american politicians talk about “ freedom , ” the ” people see bombing campaigns , chambers of torture , and the constant threat of lethal drones . the problem with obama ’s america is rooted in the conflicting nature of his administration .
president bush ’s recent visit to asia made little news – by design . but that ’s because bush did n’t begin to address the issue that is looming ever bigger in the region : a changing security face in asia in terms of china ’s rising economic and military might . this summer , for example , china and russia conducted their first-ever grand-scale military exercise . this was followed by russian news reports that china , russia , and india would conduct a trilateral military exercise , named for indira 2005 , ” ” ” ” on equal terms before the end of this year . in the past , such a combination of countries was almost unthinkable , and such exercises can not be explained as straightforward , “ one-time ” affairs with little resonance .
emerging-market governments need to address critical issues stemming from weak coordination within and among , national and municipal governments on health and health-care policies and programs . they should consider the reforms that range from giving city governments the authority , resources , and the responsibility they need to address health and health-care outcomes . anticipatory city planning , based on realistic demographic projections , patient registries , and health-information systems , as well as participation in urbanization networks , needs to be introduced . proven systems and reform should be shared among emerging-market cities , with successful new innovations and ideas tailored to local conditions . this includes new , affordable technologies , such as inexpensive community-health medications .
shanghai – tight media control over the unrest in tibet has been followed by what , to some , look like far more open coverage in the devastating earthquake in sichuan province . does this turn change into china ’s media strategy , or just a short-term transformation of tactics ? that question stands out , given chinese public opinion in the latter stages of the tibet crisis . much to the consternation of western media , chinese people all worldwide lashed out against their allegedly biased coverage of the tibetan revolt . thrones of chinese expatriates and students took to the streets protesting the prejudice perceived in western media reporting .
as a result , our forebears ’ livers remain healthy . meanwhile , our gatherer ancestors ate carbohydrates ( glucose ’s polymers ) that was transported to the liver via glycolycolytic pathway and broke down for energy . any excess glucose stimulated a pancreas a pancreas needed to liberate insulin that transported glucose into peripheral fat tissue , and that also led the liver to store glucose as glycogen ( liver starch ) . thus , their livers also stayed healthy . and nature did its part by supplying all naturally occurring heodstuffs with either fat or carbohydrate as an energy source , not both .
an estimated 2.4 million new infections occur annually , and an estimated 34 million people live with aids , which requires treatment to stay alive . there is a widespread misperception in the developed world that we have already championed the hiv/aids struggle . in reality , the crisis has simply become less visible . sub-saharan africa has 10 % of the world ’s population , but is home to 70 % of those who live with hiv/aids . throughout africa , disease is projected to have cut average national growth rates by 2-4 percentage points per year per year .
leaving the single market would create grave uncertainty for the british economy , particularly its financial sector . even the us has said that it would be reluctant to negotiate a separate free-trade deal with the uk . remaining in the single market , however , comes at a cost – one that british voters might not endorse . the uk would need to enact the type of satellite status that norway , iceland , and liechtenstein now have , accepting , and implementing decisions that it does not participate in shaping . if the democratic deficit is unacceptable to the uk , it would be left on its own , out of the economic cold .
as the curtain goes further , the two developments will profoundly influence both the withdrawal process and the eventual outcome . the first is the management of the afghan control transition , which depends on the orderly withdrawal of american and nato force by 2014 . another is the election , also to be held in 2014 , of a new afghan president – a process that needs the authorization of the united states and its nato allies to claim plausibly that they pass the country over a legitimate government . for afghanistan , ravaged by war without respite since the 1978 saur revolution , endgame will be even more nerve-wracking . as america ’s military leaves , it enters another period of political and strategic insecurity , after nearly a half-century of disorder and civil war .
new york – watching a lavish , democratic society knowingly stacks for predictable , avoidable national calamity is a rare and alarming experience . most british politicians are well aware that leaving the european union with no agreement on a post-brexit relationship will do immense damage to their countries . they are not sleepwalking into an abyss ; their eyes are wide open . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations . and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to american interests elsewhere in the world .
this , too , is no longer an option ; it is not an option , either . in fact , even if the us did not try to normalize relations , russia ’s current economic woes probably would have doomed its longstanding – and already much-diminished – support for the castro administration . normalization of relations with the us holds the key to achieving liberalization in cuba . after all , such changes are best served not by imposing stifling sanctions or through military “ “ “ “ shock and mind ” tactics , as in iraq , but by socioeconomic upgrading and diplomatic engagement via outside powers . indeed , predictions that cuba might now shift toward a chinese-style model of political autocracy and economic opening might be accurate only in the short run .
in recent years , a lot of political activity has been focused directly or indirectly on exchange rates in ways that inspire new economic and political divisions . while countries did not descended fully into protectionism since the onset of the global financial crisis , difficult economic and labor-market conditions in key countries may tempt policymakers to protect domestic markets while attempting to gain external competitiveness . but , while vigilance may be contained , the chance that major countries embrace competitive devaluations – initiating genuine currency wars of the process – are slim . it is well known that weidmann does not like italy , where central banks , particularly the european central bank , are buying up sovereign bonds . but , arguing that unconventional monetary-policy measures would carry the risk of being “ “ much stronger politicizing ” exchange-rate ” ” misses the mark .
the us census bureau projects that america ’s population will grow by an average of 49 % over the next four decades . america today is the world ’s third most populous country ; 50 years from now , it probably ranks third ( after only china and india ) . not only is immigration relevant to economic power ; given that almost all developed countries age and face the burden of providing for older generations , this could help lessen the sharpness of the policy problem . moreover , although studies suggest that a short-term , directly measurable economic advantage at the national level is relatively small , and that unskilled workers may suffer from competition , skilled migrants may be important to particular industries . a 1 % increase in the number of immigrant college graduates leads to a 6 % rise in per-capita patents .
in fact , only two of the six major economic tasks that are identified by a working conference fit neatly with the third plenum ’s own strategic agenda . the call for enhanced social safeguards accords with the third plenum ’s proposal to allocate 30 % of state-owned enterprises ’ ’ profits to fund safety-net programs , such as pensions and health care . likewise , emphasizing markets ’ ’ “ decisive role ” in upgrading china ’s industrial structure and eliminating excess capacity is compatible with the third plenum ’s goal of achieving a market-based shift toward a consumer society . but what emerges from all this is yet another example of timeworn “ cup/kitchen ” attitude toward chinese economic policymaking – innumerable proposals , initiative , and goals that are loosely connected at best and are often subject to internal inconsistencies . a new approach is needed , requiring three key changes to china ’s economic-policy framework .
the essential economic reality confronting the ecb today is that the american economy is sinking headlong into a severe slump – bernanke ’s surprise cut cut speaks volumes to that . it defies the economic logic to think that the global economy – including in europe – will escape its consequences . as europe ’s growth slows , so will its inflationary pressures . so trichet should relax , stop threatening others , and let the economic slowdown do the job for him . even with sticky wages and prices in europe , a global slowdown reduces energy , commodity , and food prices in world markets – all of which are important factors behind currently elevated european inflation levels .
all of the major players in russia ’s energy-centric economy quickly fell into line politically , enabling putin to take advantage of the country ’s entire oil and gas exports as a geopolitical cudgel . eu countries that it could not intimidate militarily , owing to nato , were wooed with discounts – or punished with price hikes . hungarian prime minister victor orbán is putin ’s staunchest friend in europe ( although greek prime minister alexis tsipras appears to want to change this ) , while poland ’s ’s ’s ’s leaders have consistently warned that russia might once again become an menace to the continent . as a result , whereas hungary pays gazprom $ 260 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas , poland is paying $ 526 – the eu ’s highest price . poles have paid a steep price , but they have been right .
but , though accusations of biopiracy may have some emotional appeal , impartial analyses have shown that they have little established . in fact , biopiracy is rare – so scarce that it can be dealt with directly . instead , the world has created a baroque , bureaucratic , politicized system that systematically inhibits scientific research , plant breeding , and the construction of intellectual property . the seed treaty achieves this by establishing a multilateral system for access to a negotiated list of agricultural genetic resources . the seed treaty achieves this , too , under the control of its parties and the secretariat of the 15 research institutes , which establishes a consultative group for international agricultural research ( cgiar ) , an influential global research partnership .
at the same time , he has decreased resources channeled toward particular religious institutions , helped those in his circle to establish private banks by easing regulations , and challenged iran ’s most powerful economic and military institution , the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) . but , as the rift between khamenei and ahmadinejad has grown , support for the us president has waned , with even state-run media denouncing ahmadinejad ’s loyalists as a “ deviation ” circle . moreover , unlike during ahmadinejad ’s premiership , non-state media are now openly criticizing his economic and political agenda . with ahmadinejad ’s second and final term fast approaching , the disgraced , unpopular president appears unlikely to abandon his effort to destabilize iran ’s ruling establishment . indeed , he has long promoted mashai as his successor , but khamenei has curbed his illicit efforts – and now placed a stop to mashai ’s candidacy completely .
under monti ’s leadership , the reforms were eventually initiated and markets calmed . in order to enhance the credibility of public finances , monti ’s administration raised taxes substantially , particularly in real estate , while preserving an already record-high income-tax rate . the fiscal plan has emphasized that italy , like japan , is a country of public debt and private wealth . as the economist marco fortis points out , italian family wealth continues , if not long , to none in europe . beyond its growing international credibility , two major changes to the italian political landscape have shaped the electoral campaign .
one of the hardest lessons for senior government officials to learn – an opportunity , including for me , when i was an australian adviser general and foreign minister – concerns futility , in all but a minuscule minority for attempting to prosecute and punish those responsible for the leaks . it does not disentangle the initial damage , and typically compounds it with further publicity . the media are never more enthusiastic about free speech than when they see it horst the faces , with rage or humiliations , of those in power . prosecution usually boosts leakers ’ stature , making it redundant as an economic deterrent . but some lines need to be drawn where good government becomes possible , just as a privacy zone in our personal and family lives are critical to sustaining the relationships that matter most to us .
clearly , there is no form of brexit – or post-brexit britain – that satisfies both groups . this explains may ’s desperation to push brexit through as much as soon as possible . she wants to get out before voters realize that the leave campaign was selling them a bogus bill of goods , including a promise that they might hold onto all the benefits of eu membership , particularly full access to europe ’s single market without having to let the free movement of labor . moreover , though may was in the uk ’s “ remain ” camp during the referendum campaign , she seems to realize that , as prime minister , she will be held accountable for any setbacks in the brexit negotiations . she also knows that she can not possibly succeed politically , because the media will invariably spotlight “ on “ defeats ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” while scarcely being heard about victory .
among other things , such surveys should aim to develop bright images of adolescents ’ exposure to avoidable risk factors like alcohol and illicit drug use , unsafe sexual behaviors , violence , obesity , physical inactivity , and unhealthy diets . in order to complement such efforts , we also must invest in improving our understanding of how these risk factors – most often studied when combined with early childhood and adulthood – affect ’ health . according to the world health organization ’s global disease burden study , health risk factors explain at least 50 % of early death and disability from adults aged 50 and above ; for young people , that figure drops to 26 % . more studies are needed to inform health policy and planning appropriately . at the same time , data-collection efforts should include a focus on mental wellbeing .
pakistan is a troubled country , politically as much as economically . but talk of regime change may have spurred musharraf to re-enter politics . only a politician with the backing of major constituencies can hope to restore political order and economic welfare , and musharraf is presenting himself as a candidate whom the army could support . thus , in a long conversation with the bbc before initiating his new party , musharraf suggested that pakistan ’s ’s army was the only institution that could save the country from its current woes . “ there is a sense of despondency in pakistan . ”
with policymakers effectively rewarded for myopic thinking , western democracies find themselves struggling to ensure stable , long-term growth in ways that say , an authoritarian china does not . there are at least two ways to address this problem in a democratic context . first , governments could be binding on their predecessors ’ policy choices . that way , more forward-thinking legislation that had been debated and enacted would actually have time to take effect , without the risks that it would simply be repealed by the subsequent us administration . the european union provides one example of how long-standing binding commitments can work .
this starts with the political will and the setting of priorities . at the wef in incheon , nobel peace prize laureate kailash satyarthi satyarthi has called for a mass popular movement demanding that education be placed prominently on the agenda of any politician running for elections , at all levels of government . for the sdgs to be operational , education must get higher bilaterally , nationally , and globally . the incheon declaration calls for allocating at least 15-20 % of total public expenditures to education . moreover , the ongoing shortfall in aid to education must be reversed , with new funding – such as emerging-economy donors , the private sector , foundations , and philanthropists – being mobilized .
ukraine ’s current refinance rate stands at 16 % annually , at 10 % below the rate of inflation , implying that ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10 % per year . as a result , ukraine ’s money supply , m3 , has exploded to no less than 52 % in the past year , which points to an annual inflation rate of 30 % soon . the nbu ’s leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation , but its insistence on the dollar ’s peg ties its hands because it prevents them from raising interest rates enough . instead , they have reverted to tough reserve requirements , effectively ratifying credit , and causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis , which is likely to force some medium-size banks into insolvency , owing to liquidity problems . indeed , rationing is always worse than a market can .
the former worries iranian domestic politics and an ongoing power struggle within the regime – & a struggle that scuttled a diplomatic solution once before , because neither the conservatives nor the reformers were willing to afford president mahmoud ahmadinejad a diplomatic triumph . one can only hope that , given the severity of the situation , this route to failure would close off . developments in syria , iran ’s ’s last remaining ally in the region , are just as likely to play a role . the fall of president bashar al-assad ’s regime would amount to a strategic debacle for iran , which would then confront the united front of arab states backing turkey , america , and , in a sense , israel . iran would then find it hard to maintain its foothold in lebanon , and its position would become more complicated , even in iraq , despite its shia majority .
the eu ’s labor-sharing approach , hammering out agreements , and resolving conflict through multiple committees may be frustrating and lacks a drama ; but it has become increasingly relevant for many issues in a networked , interdependent world . as mark leonard , the director of the european council on foreign relations , put it , “ the conventional wisdom is that europe ’s hour came and gone . ” its lack of vision , divisions , obsession with legal frameworks , unwillingness to project military power , and sclerotic economics contrasts starkly with the united states ’ more dominant even than rome … ; but the problem is not europe ’s obsolete understanding of power . the american political scientist andrei moravcsik makes the similar argument that european nations , singly and collectively , are the only states other than the american one that can channel global influence across the full spectrum from ‘ hard ’ to ‘ soft ’ power . insofar as the term maintains some meanings , the world is bipolar and will probably remain so for the foreseeable future .
tehran – iranians will go to the polls on june 12 to elect a new president . while some argue that president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s re-election is a foregone conclusion , the outcome is actually not at all clear . iran ’s ’s ’s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , has said repeatedly in public settings that he will not spell his preference among the candidates . indeed , in massachusetts in march 21 , ayatollah khamenei said , “ there is some talk that i support a special candidate for a presidential election . but i have one vote , and i would not identify some candidate , because the people themselves should pick their candidates based on personal knowledge .
but this will offset the limits of personal tax deductions and exclusions , and lower tax rates on personal income boost taxable incomes as individuals increase earnings and offset the compensation shift from fringe benefits to “ tax-free ” cash . likewise , moving toward a territorial tax system boosts taxable profits , particularly in the short term as corporations repatriate some of the existing stock of overseas funds . while net tax changes may widen the budget deficit in the short run , the incentives effects of lower tax rates , and increased capital accumulation will mean faster economic growth and higher real incomes , both of which cause rising taxable incomes and lower long-term deficits . there is an important legislative reason why the projected budget will go back to surplus . the republicans have only a tiny majority in the senate , where a filibuster rule requires the three-fifths majority to pass most legislation , giving democrats the ability to block a republican tax agenda .
at the same time , the eu needs to restart its operational operations to combat refugee smuggling in the mediterranean . second , europe needs to manage economic migrants and asylum-seekers in isolation . combining them has brought its asylum system close to collapse ; separating them would help to ensure that those in fear can be given a fair hearing in which their rights are protected . tackling genuine economic and social needs in the eu requires an effective blue – or a green-card policy for economic migrants with an overall immigration target . and policymakers must not wait until the next migration crisis , before imposing it , can be introduced .
will the fed ’s gradual easing of qe bring about more emerging-market challenges this year ? to what extent are the conditions comparable today to those triggered by the 1997 asian crisis or other abrupt capital-flow reversals in recent decades ? emerging-market bulls note that most major middle-income countries substantially kept their public-debt/gdp ratios down , giving them the fiscal room they had lacked in the past . but none of the mexican “ tequila ” crises ” of 1994 or the asian crises of 1997 stemmed from large public deficits . in both cases , efforts to defend the fixed exchange rate when confronted with capital-flow reversals were prominent , as was true in turkey in the year prior to its currency collapse in june 2001 .
already , many people in their fifties and sixties would want to remain economically productive , perhaps working 20-30 hours a week . at the same time , younger people have long long made it onto education , leisure , friends , and , crucially , children . both aspirations can be fulfilled if societies allow older people to work more years , leaving everyone with fewer hours . one option is to shift toward an average workweek of more than 25 hours and an average working-age population extending up to an age of 70 and further ages if healthy life expectancy continues to rise . such reform could take place over several decades , without slowing economic growth or declining prosperity .
it is this commitment by which the eu is currently bound to be bound . “ bouncing ” to britain in this way is simply impossible . british public opinion today is so hostile , to the eu generally , and to europe in particular that a referendum could not be won without a massive government campaign of persuasion . denmark ’s government did just that and seems to be bringing the danish public around the idea of joining europe . prime minister tony blair is apparently convinced of the strategic desirability of joining europe , but because a yes vote in a referendum now looks so implausible that he may be unlikely to attempt .
at the center of the array of scenarios considered the intergovernmental panel on climate change projects that atmospheric co2 concentrations will reach almost three times their pre-industrial level in 2100 . while the bush administration remains skeptical about science behind such projections , some state and local governments are enacting measures to cut carbon emissions . more important , companies like general electric are committed to green goals , which go well beyond government regulation . a recent report by the bipartisan national energy policy commission exemplifies a new coalition . whereas president bush argues that technological advances in hydrogen fuels and fuel cells will curb oil imports in the long run , such measures require major changes in the transportation infrastructure that will require decades to complete .
people in these fields ultimately buy and sell corporate executives just as much as people in engineering fields do . hardly anyone makes that all the way to the top in the business world . an important point for students to bear in mind is that they should motivate themselves to attain deep understanding , not rote memorization , of subjects that they study to fulfill the role of the true expert in whatever field they ultimately choose to pursue . at the same time , they should invest in acquiring communication skills that are similarly critical to a successful career . achieving this kind of education is probably pursuing what one naturally finds interesting and engaging , whether it finances or physiology .
but this day , too , is about spreading the message on behalf of elizabeth and other women like her : abortion , while in many countries a political wedge issue simply means life . every year , 25 % of all pregnancies – some $ 56 million – end up with an end . abortion occurs in every country , and within every socioeconomic class . in the united states , 61 % of abortion patients are in their twenties , and 59 % are already mothers , and almost two-thirds identify with organized religions . but abortion is most common in developing countries , where access to family-planning services is often restricted .
the ecb should not delude itself in thinking that a small rise in interest rates will do enough . when and when wage pressure comes , the ecb , staying true of its word , may be compelled to raise interest rates far more than it now anticipates . the second argument is that if the ecb stands firm , workers will not demand higher nominal wages , because it understands that this would merely cause higher interest rates and higher unemployment . there is no irktruth to this argument ; monetary policy probably has some effect on wage bargaining . but one should not expect too much from a tough ecb stance .
virginia aupload has allowed its 180 million registered users to upload and download movies , tv shows , and music , with some of the money earned through dotcom ( from advertisements and subscriptions ) on display at its mansion near auckland , where it has kept its rolls-royce and other exotic cars . dotcom ’s ’s lawyer argues that megaupload merely provided storage for its subscribers ’ files , with no control over what they are storing them . but megaupload has offered cash rewards to users who uploaded writings that have proved popular with other users . last month , the united states considered legislation that aims to stop internet piracy . bill bills were written at urging hollywood studios and publishing and recording industries that argue that violations of online copyright costs american 100,000 jobs .
moscow – when the opening ceremony of the beijing olympic games begin in just a few days , viewers will be presented with the minutely choreographed spectacle swathed in the nationalist kitsch . of course , images that recall hitler ’s do-stepping storm troopers are just the last thing china ’s leaders hold on to their olympics ; after all , official chinese nationalism proclaims a country “ a peaceful rise ” within the idyll of “ harmonious development ” ” ” ” ” ” ” . yet , both aesthetically and politically , parallels are hardly far-fetched . indeed , by electing albert speer jr. , hitler ’s favorite architect , and designer of the 1936 berlin olympics , to design a master plan for the beijing games , china ’s government has itself alluded to the radical politicization of aesthetics that was a hallmark of twentieth-century totalitarianism . like those regimes , whether fascist or communist , china ’s ’s ’s leaders sought to turn the public space and sports events into visible proof of their fitness and mandate to govern .
if anything , economists ’ embrace of that role has since grown stronger . but it has also made the subjects less relevant , reducing their legitimacy and credibility . economists are no longer seen by many publicly asking the right questions , or by trying to answer them with integrity . to regain their credibility , economics needs a much more open way to criticism of assumptions , methods , and outcomes . the fine truths spoken by dissenting voices can not be ignored indefinitely .
the united states is reckoning with an increasingly unstable president , a plutocratic cabinet , and a republican congressional majority . europe is in the throes of multiple economic , social , political , and institutional crises . china , on the other hand , is both dynamic and outward-looking – giving good reason for the eu to assume vigorous leadership and engaging in constructive partnerships with china on key initiatives ( such as sustainable infrastructure across eurasia ) . in short , this is a critical time for germany and europe to provide vision , stability , and global leadership . and that imperative extending to german chancellor angela merkel ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s christian democratic union ( cdu ) , its bavarian sister party , the christian social union ( csu ) , and the spd .
in keeping with china ’s recent effort to project its own “ soft ” flank , the opening ceremony produced the idea of an historic but dynamic culture at its best . other than the presence of a couple of people ’s liberation army soldiers , one would have been hard pressed to find any visible evidence of the reigning communist regime or its founder , mao zedong . equally significant was china ’s projection as the nascent leader of a new international cultural order . the “ bird ’s nest ” stadium became the formation of a transnational design team of herzog & de meuron , with suggestions by visual performer ai weiwei . many artists involved in forming the spectacle , including the bollywood cai guo qiang , dance star shen wei , and the composer tan dun , earned their glory mainly in the west .
my research that covered thousands of interviews with women from india to burkina faso has centered on just one question : how can the international community improve the welfare of the world ’s poorest women ? the answer , it turns out , is to help them do what they already do on their own . one of the most powerful ways to empower women anywhere , but especially in the developing world is by promoting financial autonomy . in many areas , that means supporting “ “ “ “ “ informal savings groups , ” the ” ” like-minded networks of women paying dues to build shared resource pools . that money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items , such as small business expenditures , school fees , or health-care costs .
so the summit ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s outcome was far from a miracle . what really mattered in heiligendamm was not the decisions taken by any putative global government , but the fact that the g8 days now seem numbered . politically and economically , china and india seem to be more relevant today than some of europe ’s g8 members do today . indeed , europeans should understand that this viewpoint is spreading globally , particularly across the other side of the atlantic . president putin ’s behavior during the summit clearly demonstrated what he thinks about europeans ; not too much .
african leaders are right to be concerned . though the eu argues that the epas will buttress the afcfta , preliminary research indicates that the trade gains brought about by the epas , as negotiated are likely to be concentrated on a handful of agricultural products – and to exclude the least-developed countries . indeed , in most areas , the epas will harm intra-african trade , weakening trade revenues , and undermining trade-driven industrialization . some argue that the problem is more about timing , because the losses are likely to materialize immediately , and the potential benefits that increased eu access will take longer to emerge . given this , epa proponents argue , a special fund should be established to compensate for some of the short-term losses .
at the 1995 smithsonian institution in washington , for example , seeking to take a fresh look at the enola gay , a plane shutting down an atomic bomb on hiroshima . john brower , the american historian and specialist of modern japan , studied the matter at length . he demonstrated how history can be presented and appreciated in totally different ways : from the american or japanese viewpoint , although no one produces facts or falsifies sources . the choice and the combination of data is enough . for americans , a heroic or victorious account was found in which atomic bombs represent the ultimate blow against an aggressive , fanatic , and savage enemy .
it would have to be paved the way together at the october 17 meeting of the european council , where europe ’s leaders are growing increasingly frustrated with the entire process . moreover , johnson has already disbanded the civil-service team that spearheaded the earlier talks . any new deal would perhaps ’s old agreement on several bells and whistles . it would put pressure on real issues down the road , rather than the end of the brexit debate . that show has years to run out .
likewise , our inability to come together to stop syrian president bashar al-assad ’s war-crimes against his own people left the void created by putin and iran . european leaders all too often shout from the sidelines when they should be on the field , acting to defend common european interests . and , as if our inability to ensure stability in our own neighborhood were not enough , we also allowed right-wing populist and nationalist movements to take off within europe itself . those movements , actively fomented by russia , produced homegrown political leaders who frighteningly – but not a startling – resemble putin and erdoğan . poland ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s de facto leadership leader , jarosław kaczyński , and hungarian prime minister viktor orbán , in particular , have busily included illiberal states within the eu .
a shared framework also needs to be created to allow such programs to scaled up and be implemented in various contexts . delivering benefits to points , for example , ” ” ” ” rather than money denominated in a particular currency , would enable regimes to operate across borders at a time when workers increasingly need to do the same thing . and standardized training credentials would maintain value as they move with those who acquire them . as the nature of work changes , so must the nature of benefit systems . to deliver opportunities and security for all , everywhere at a time of widespread technological disruption , governments and private-sector actors must work together to advance innovative solutions that meet workers ’ urgent and evolving needs .
moreover , even without a timely correction , brazil will respond to crisis elsewhere in the opposite direction in mexico . rightly or wrongly , mexican policymakers were in awe of wall street ; brazil has hardly such hang out . ultimately , brazilian policymakers worry their ups and downs , rather than the prosperity of foreign investors . should and when , on the other side , brazilian policymakers would shed very little tears for international investors . on the surface , and beneath , brazil has made a dramatic turn : inflation is down to negligible levels .
by incorporating carbon-reduction strategies into farming and land conservation , more heat-trapping gases can lock in forests and soils . but , while the techniques already exist , success will require increasing use of no-till farming , adopting the principles of permaculture , better managing wetlands , and using rotational grazing techniques , among other steps . markets ’ power to drive the radical changes in power and land-use uses is great ; but , as the 2017 storm season should remind us , the climate emergency we face demands vigorous and urgent action . transforming how people acquire and consume energy and use land will require powerful incentives and policy frameworks to set the course for success . but do n’t desperation : there is still time to save our climate .
many of the democratic candidates have called for major expansion of government-health-care provision . but their suggestions – a single-payer system ( “ medicare for all ” ) , a national health service , or something else – do not mean all of this . a few contenders , including bernie sanders , elizabeth warren , kamala harris , and beto o’rourke – disagree completely on the details of such regimes , or simply have n’t spelled them out . yet , after former us president barack obama attempted to rehabilitate the american health-care disaster with halfway measures – arguably the most that was politically feasible at a time – those vying for the democratic nomination clearly have further ambitious plans . warren , meanwhile , has proposed introducing universal childcare , with the goal of fund a wealth tax on fortunes above $ 50 million .
but there is another explanation , one that fits perfectly with rationality and self-interest . when mainstream politicians lose their trustworthiness , it is natural for voters to discount the promises they make . voters are more likely to attract candidates with anti-establishment credentials , and they can safely be expected to diverge from prevailing policies . in the language of economists , centrist politicians are facing an asymmetric problem . they claim to be reformers , but why should voters believe that leaders who seem no different from the earlier crops of politicians who oversold them the gains from globalization and pooh-poohed grievances ?
today , leaders in rwanda , widely viewed as an african success story , have improved stability by moving away from the washington consensus approach to governance . politically , rwanda is a strong , disciplined , and has organized but not a liberal one . the landslide reelection of president paul kagame last year had more for power than for democracy . although kagame remains popular , his administration has been criticized for stifling free speech and human rights in the run-up to the vote . the conclusion that i draw is not that human rights do n’t matter , but that political discipline and imperfect forms of democracy are acceptable when a tradeoff sustains economic and institutional governance .
the cross-border flows of goods , information , people , and capital that its lifeblood depend on a threshold level of safety , stability , and unpredictability . it is this threshold that seems to be coming under threat . continued economic progress in the developing world and recovery in the advanced countries requires preventing local and regional conflicts from delivering large systemic shocks . in terms of priorities , it is arguably more important for g-20 governments to strengthen core systems that allow global flows than they are to address strictly economic issues . moreover , there is a clear , shared interest to do this : nobody benefits from widening systemic risk .
washington , dc – participants in the occupy wall street movement are right to argue that big banks have never been properly investigated for the home mortgage origination , aggregation , and securitization behavior that has been central to a financial crisis – and to lose more than eight million jobs . but , thanks to efforts by new york ’s chief executive chairman eric schneiderman and others , serious debate has commenced in the united states about the out-face court mortgage-settlement out-exist between state attorney generals and prominent financial-sector firms . talks among state executives , the obama administration , and the banks are currently targeting news abuses in servicing mortgages , foreclosing on homes , and evicting their residents . but leading banks are also charged with illicit behavior by urging people to borrow , for example , to invalidating them about the interest rates that would actually pay , while misrepresenting the ensuing mortgage-backed securities to investors . if such charges are true , the bank executives involved may fear that civil lawsuits will uncover evidence that could be used in criminal prosecution .
“ over rivers and down highways and down the highways , and along with myriad jungle routes , east pakistan ’s population continues to hemorrhage into india : never-ending unorganized flows of refugees with little tin kettles , cardboard boxes , and ragged clothes on their heads carrying their ill children and their older . they pad along barefooted barefooted , with a mud sucking at their heels in a part of the wet . they are quiet , except for a child whimpering now and then , but their faces tell the story . many are sick , and each is covered with sores . others have cholera , and , having died by a roadside that there can not bury them .
accusations of currency manipulation and the threat of protectionist measures have intensified . with the uk giving world free trade in the 1840s , it has now decided to go it alone , the ancient atlantic charter of allies is imposing national sovereignty ahead of global public goods . now the global spotlight is turning to france and its looming presidential elections . at stake is the sputtering franco-german engine , which drove european integration and kept it on the center of the postwar multilateral system . a victory for le pen in early may would spell the end of the eu , leaving german chancellor angela merkel as the ultimate pillar of a crumbling world order .
new york – having been the bright-eyed eighth grader in my home native sri lanka , i could not have been able to wait out my early gender learning class . in our early teens , my classmates and i were just as curious as we were clueless about sexuality and sexuality . yet , instead of receiving reliable answers to pressing questions about our bodies , relationships , and sexuality , we were simply handed a book to read a particular chapter and left to figure things out in our own lifetime . millions of young people around the world had similar experiences , often with serious side effects . following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the american might well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
after all , both iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now . as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months . if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come . regardless of how facebook ’s own digital-currency moonshot , libra , fares have already provided a wake-up call for firms and policymakers around the world . “ “ “ if revolution there is to be , ” let us take it rather than undergo it , great otto von bismarck once said .
four decades after the “ nixon shock , ” ” ” no one disputes that china has benefited enormously today , an impoverished and autarkic country that nixon had visited are history . as a result , global reintegration has transformed china into an economic powerhouse . it is the world ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s largest exporter in volume , and it is the world ’s ’s ’s second-largest economy . china is feeling this way all over the world , from mines in africa to apple shops in the united states . as we reflect china ’s spectacular advance since 1972 , it is also an opportune time to reflect on how china continues to fall short of overcoming the systemic impediments to long-term success .
a significant chinese slowdown may already unfold . us president donald trump ’s trade war has shaken confidence , but this is only downward niches to an economy that has been already slowing as it makes the shift away from exports – and investment-led growth toward more sustainable domestic consumption-led growth . how much the chinese economy will slow makes an open question ; but , given the inherent contradiction between an ever-tighter party-led political system and the need for an ever more vigorous consumer-led economic system , long-term growth could start declining quite dramatically . unfortunately , the possibility of avoiding consumer-led growth and continued support for exports and real-estate investment has little appeal , either . china is already a dominant global exporter , with neither market-based space nor political tolerance to permit it to maintain its previous pace of export-led expansion .
the arab world faces severe problems , which can be met only through more flexible , democratic political systems . a second arab human development report , issued in 2003 , underlines the close relationship between the arab world ’s education deficiencies and its lack of democracy . in short , democracy requires that an informed citizenry that can question its own governments . a well-educated citizenry is also vital if young men and women are to acquire the skills required to fulfill the employment sort of job opportunities today ’s globally and competitive world demands . alas , instead of making progress , what we perceive as a cycle of inadequate education leads to a missed economic opportunity .
new york – a president threatened to wipe out turkey ’s economy if it allowed it to do its utmost . with the kurds – most of them civilians – fleeing turkish bombs , the un security council remained typically silent , while the europeans denounced everything and all involved . as foreign-policy catastrophes move forward , this is one on record books . but the seeds for this larger conflagration were sown long before the now-infamous trump-erdoğan call . absent any coherent policy , conditions were ripe for a crisis .
but a <UNK> ter-money program – the fanciful idea when milton friedman proposed it in 1969 – would also turn out to represent a radical departure for policymakers , demanding an abundance of caution regarding citizen and investor perceptions , confidence , and robust governance structures . and such an approach would cement the notion that central-bank policy is “ the sole game ” in the city , ” relieving elected government leaders of their responsibility for pro-growth policies and the fiscal choices they control . a less risky , time-tested path for stimulating demand would produce significant increases in publicly funded infrastructure . it is well documented that europe and the united states have under-invested in infrastructure . from a macroeconomic perspective , infrastructure investment is a “ twofer ” – – – – that boosts productivity and competitiveness in the long run , and boosts demand , output , and employment with significant short-run multiplier effects .
with the us government losing $ 4.5 trillion annually by subsidizing passenger fares , it has little money to spend on upgrading infrastructure , improving safety standards , or speeding the trains . as a result , railways run out of money before they run out of plans . in the last 30 years alone , there have been only 317 of the 676 self-sanctioned parliament , and it is hard to see how railways can acquire an estimated $ 30 billion needed to complete the remaining 359 projects . and , if all of this were not bad enough , india ’s leadership seems not to recognize the challenges that the railways present . in a country in which rail passengers can not even expect a clean toilet , let alone on-time course , prime minister narendra modi has talked about introducing bullet trains – most recently amid irrationally grandiose aspirations .
under federalism , whether cooperative or uncooperative ” ” ” – – – it is often assumed that state and local governments pursue the same targets . indeed , there is a deep divide between left-leaning “ blue ” cities and right-leaning “ red ” states on which many find themselves . and there are many forms that state governments can thwart progressive federalism at the municipal level . cities , for their part , often lack the information and resources needed to develop and implement effective policies . a wide range of organizations have now emerged to strengthen the policy-making capacity of city governments including michael bloomberg ’s government innovation program , fuse corps , results for america , its social financing , its third sector of capital partners , and usafacts .
we need to look beyond these figures to determine who really is accountable to fomenting a political climate , where blatant lies and explicit racism and bigotry have entered mainstream public discourse . only by identifying the sources of the odious virus now afflicting our democracies can we take the practical steps needed to quarrealize them . let ’s start with “ patient zero ” in this political plague : rupert murdoch . for decades , this impresario of the right-wing political-entertainment complex has coarsened politics in the uk and american – not to mention his native australia – for profit and political influence . murdoch ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s ’s newspapers and television networks may as well patented the recipe for the hollowing , dog-whistle politics that fueled trump ’s rise and the brexit vote .
